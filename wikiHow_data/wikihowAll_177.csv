Look over your lawn for brown areas.,
Pull back the turf in a 1 foot (0.3 m) square area of your lawn.,
Visit an online lawn care store or natural gardening store to buy ""milky spore."",
Apply milky spore according to package directions.,
Pull back parts of the lawn that have died because of grubs.",How to Protect Your Lawn From Insect Damage2," Places where grubs are attacking the roots of your lawn look like they have undergone drought. Grubs are the larvae of a few types of scarab beetle, including the Japanese beetle and June beetle.

, Areas that are attacked by grubs will lift easily because many of the roots have been eaten away. Count the number of grubs underneath, and if they total more than 5, you should treat your grub problem immediately.


Killing the grubs will also protect your flowers and trees, because it kills larvae before they have a chance to become full grown beetles. Japanese beetles feast on many garden plants.

, It may go by another name because milky spore is a brand name. You can get it in a long, cylindrical applicator or in a mix for a lawn spreader.

, Make sure the temperature is over 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 degrees Celsius), the temperature needed for the bacteria to become deadly to grubs when it is ingested. Milky spore is a bacteria that is deadly to grubs but not to humans.

, Areas of the lawn with strong roots may be able to withstand a grub infestation. Plant seeds or sod and fertilize as needed.

Use pesticides only after you have tried natural approaches.,
Look for an organic pesticide containing ""bacillus thuringiensis"" before trying more toxic chemicals.,
Wear long sleeves, long pants, safety goggles and rubber gloves when mixing pesticides.,
Use a lawn spreader to distribute granules around the yard.,
Spray the lawn with water from a garden hose after you have applied the chemicals.,
Keep children and pets off the lawn until the insecticide indicates it is safe.,
Rinse out the containers on the lawn, immediately after you treat it.",How to Protect Your Lawn From Insect Damage4," They must be used in small quantities with special precautions. However, they may the best way to stop ticks, ants and other resilient insects.

, This pesticide is not fatal for pets or humans. Choose a granule form of insecticide if you have a lawn spreader, or a spray form that you can use with a hose.

, Most poisoning incidents occur during the mixing of lawn pesticides. Mix the chemicals on the lawn, instead of on a sidewalk or in a garage.

, You can also mix in the appropriate amount to a hose attachment, and spray the lawn.

, This will help the chemicals sink into the soil, rather than stay on the top of the grass. Pay attention to label directions about when and how the water should be applied.

, Put up warning signs if you are treating the front lawn, so that neighbor children know to stay off the lawn.

, The excess chemicals will sink into the soil where they can be beneficial and will have a better chance of avoiding the storm drains. Store all pesticides in their original containers.

Aerate your lawn to promote the healthy formation of the root system.,
Rake your lawn to remove thatch and other debris.,
Fertilize the yard according to the type of grass you have.,

Mow the grass regularly.,
Prune trees and shrubs.,
Set up a sprinkler system for consistent watering.,
Keep pests under control.,
Use mulch to keep plants growing.,
Keep a flower bed.,
Plant a vegetable garden.,
Put up a fence.,
Build a rustic footpath.,
Invest in some outdoor furniture.",How to Prepare Your Yard for Summer," Aeration allows the grass to breathe, and also enables water and nutrients reach the root system more efficiently. Failure to aerate your lawn sufficiently will make it much more difficult for grass and plants to survive during the hottest part of the season.Perform the process in the autumn if your lawn is a cool-season grass, like bluegrass or ryegrass. If you live in a climate where warm-season grasses thrive, aerate in early spring.
Many experts suggest aerating your lawn every 1 to 3 years, but high-traffic areas may require more frequent attention.;
, Go over your lawn from end to end with a rake to clear it of thatch, or decaying plant material, that has accumulated on the ground. A thick layer of thatch can block sunlight and prevent water from reaching deep down to the roots of the grass. Dethatch in late autumn while you're raking leaves to prepare your yard for the summer.Consider raking again in spring, particularly if your lawn shows evidence of compaction.

, Fertilizers supplement the nutrients found in your lawn's soil and keeps grass growing thick and lush. Apply fertilizer at least twice a year during the peak growing seasons of your lawn. Scale back fertilizing about 30 days before the highest summer temperatures hit.Cool-season grasses: lawns comprised of these types of grasses should be fertilized during early spring and at the onset of fall. Use fertilizer with higher nitrogen concentrations when fertilizing in autumn to ensure the survival of the grass.
Warm-season grasses: these varieties flourish during the summer months. A nitrogen-rich fertilizer should be spread in the spring, when the lawn shows its first signs of vibrancy. Fertilize again in late summer.

, This should be done prior to your grass's peak growing season, preferably in the fall. Till the soil and spread the seed evenly across the bare spot to fill in gaps in the lawn growth. Use a standard fertilizer and water the area as you normally would.Add nitrogen-rich fertilizer after the seeds have germinated to ensure robust growth., Mowing should be done roughly once a week, though how fast your grass will grow will depend on climate conditions. Keep grass cut to a height of about 2.5 to 3”, except in the hottest part of the summer, when you should let it grow about half an inch longer. Mowing keeps grass growing at a healthy rate and makes your lawn look neat and manicured.Grass needs to grow slightly longer in the hottest summer months to provide shade for its roots and conserve moisture in the soil. Be careful not to cut more than about 1/3 of the blade at a time, as this can cause structural damage to the grass that inhibits growth.Make sure you give your lawn mower a checkup before bringing it out of winter hibernation. Dull blades should be sharpened, tires should be inflated and there should be a sufficient amount of oil in the motor.

, Trim dead and excess growth off of trees and shrubs in your yard. Pruning promotes healthy growth by eliminating parts of the shrub that are dead, infested with harmful insects or damaged by weather. It also allows you to shape the growth of the tree or shrub, resulting in a more aesthetic appearance.Look for dead and damaged limbs to prune first. These will usually be identifiable by their colorless appearance and lack of living thriving foliage. At best, dead limbs are an eyesore; at worst, disease can spread to the rest of the shrub.
Always remove any tree limbs that extend precariously over driveways, walkways or any place in that yard where people tend to gather. These can be become a hazard if they fall.

, Your grass and plants need copious amounts of water to survive in the dry summer heat. Even in areas that receive a lot of rainfall, natural moisture might not be enough to keep your greenery healthy on its own. Set up a sprinkler system to run every 24 hours to ensure that your lawn and surrounding plants are being effectively irrigated.It’s best to water slowly and gradually to allow water to penetrate to the root level and avoid runoff. Having your sprinkler system set to a timer and moving in smooth, sweeping motions can accomplish this.Water your yard at night or in the cool early morning hours so that the moisture is going straight to the grass rather than being evaporated by heat.

, Inspect flower bushes, shrubs and fruit trees periodically for garden pests like aphids, grasshoppers, slugs and snails. These little critters like to make a meal out of the leaves of flowering plants, which can compromise the health of the plant. Remove larger offenders by hand or with a water hose and treat plants with natural pesticides to keep pests away from the plant in the future.Plants are natural habitats to many different kinds of animals and insects, and some are more destructive than others. It might be a good idea to do some research on the kind of pests that populate your area so that you can tell a harmless bug from an unwelcome one.If you grow fruits or vegetables, watch out for larger grazing animals like rabbits and deer. If left unchecked, they can ruin weeks of hard gardening work in a matter of days.

, Spread a thin layer of mulch over the base of plants during the height of the summer heat. Mulch is full of beneficial soil nutrients and is dense enough to protect a plant’s roots and stalk from the sun. Mulching in conjunction with frequent watering will ensure that your plants never go thirsty.Mulch can be bought cheap at any gardening center, or you can easily make your own from the brush in your yard using a wood chipper or shredder.

, Designate a small corner of your yard to use to grow flowers. Plant a variety of seasonals and perennials to suit your own preferences. The delightful colors and fragrances of a flower bed can add an idyllic beauty to your home.Consult with a gardening expert to see what types of flowers grow best in your region’s particular climate.
Don’t overwater flowers. Unlike fast-growing plants like grass and shrubs, flowers don’t require as much moisture on average, and watering too often may cause them to wither., Many people have begun sewing small patches of crops right in their own backyards. Decide what you’d like to grow—beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, squash; your options are nearly limitless—and make sure the soil is thoroughly aerated and suitable to grow vegetables in. Raising your own small batches of vegetables will give your yard a utilitarian appeal while providing you and your family with fresh, homegrown food to enjoy all summer long.Use organic compost to help vegetable crops absorb vital nutrients.
If yard space is an issue, considering planting your vegetables on a vertical trellis, or even in a compact grower that you can keep inside your own house!Pick ripe vegetables immediately to keep pests from feeding on them.

, Build a simple wooden fence to mark your property and give your yard a sense of peaceful containment. Fences can be useful for offering a little privacy if you live in a crowded neighborhood, as well as keeping out animals that may trample and devour plants.If you contract with a handyman, ask them about the materials and expenses needed to put a fence around your yard.

, If you have an especially large yard, or one that is divided up with shrubs, flower beds or amenities like a pool or fire pit, you might construct a simple stepping stone path out of flagstones or wooden planks. A footpath can give you an expedient way to traverse your yard or garden without wearing down the grass, is easy to build and has a pleasant, quaint aesthetic.Take a look at these resources for simple plans to lay down a footpath: , You’ll be spending a lot of time outside this summer, so make sure you do it in leisure. Purchase some nice, sturdy lawn chairs to give you a place to sit and sip lemonade on a hot day. If space permits, you could even set up an entire dining set to host picnics. Study the layout of plants, trees and shrubs to decide on the best way to arrange the furniture, and turn your yard into a relaxing outdoor lounge. Be sure that you’re buying furniture with water-resistant cushions and surfaces. This way, you won’t have to worry about bringing it in every time it rains. Water-resistant outdoor furniture is often cleaned easily, as well.
Place a small bench within a garden for a nice seating area, or lay out some reclining chairs somewhere unshaded for sunbathing.

Add an irrigation system before planting a lawn with stolons.,
Grade or edge the area where the lawn will be planted as needed.,
Add topsoil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 cm).

,
Till the lawn to be planted with stolons.,
Rake the area smooth, remove any large rocks, and break up thick dirt clods.

,
Prepare your soil for planting stolons by applying a lawn fertilizer.

,
Add a weed control if the topsoil has been brought into the site or if the area has a lot of weeds.,
Fill a bucket with water, and soak the stolons 3 to 4 hours before planting.,
Scatter stolons on top of the tilled soil, or plant them in rows.,
Cover the stolons with 1/8 to 1/2 inch (.32 to 1.27 cm) of topsoil, peat moss, or other moisture-retaining planting material.

,
Use a lawn roller to gently press the stolons into the topsoil.

,
Water the lawn immediately after planting.,
Allow 60 to 90 days for full coverage of the lawn.

",How to Plant a Lawn from Stolons,";
, Make sure the grade is away from buildings.

,, Use a hand tiller or a tractor with a tiller attachment.

,,, Stolons are quite susceptible to weeds during the first few weeks after planting, and putting down weed control before planting will give them a head start over the weeds.

,


If the stolons came in a bag, fill the bag with water. When you are ready to plant, puncture the bag and drain the water.

,


To plant stolons in rows, make small furrows in the topsoil 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep and 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) apart.
Place the stolons in the furrows with the nodes in contact with the soil.

,,, Keep the stolons moist for at least 10 days after planting. You may need to water every few hours throughout the day. After 10 days, the watering may be decreased.

Choose the right time of year to overseed.,
Manage weeds.,
Mow your existing lawn.,
Rake up the thatch and grass clippings.,
Loosen the soil using the most appropriate method based on the compactness of your soil.,
Conduct a soil test to determine the pH of your soil.,
Apply lime to your lawn if necessary.,
Top-dress the soil with additional compost.,
Spread grass seed evenly over the entire lawn.,
Lightly rake the newly seeded area to help the seeds settle on the soil.,
Apply a slow-release nitrogen fertilizer.,
Water the lawn completely immediately after overseeding.,
Apply quick-release nitrogen fertilizer.,
Mow the lawn once it reaches 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm).",How to Overseed a Lawn," Arguably the best time to overseed is during September, or at least six weeks before temperatures reach freezing or there is an overnight frost.If you can't overseed in September, overseed in early spring.


Grass seed grows and germinates best when daytime temperatures are around 50°F (10°C). Germination will not take place if overnight temperatures create heavy frost.
Allow at least one to three weeks for the seeds to germinate. You will then want to allow the grass seed a few weeks to get rooted before a frost.;
, If weeds are present, you will need to spray your lawn with a weed killer at least two weeks before you begin your project. Choose a broadleaf weed killer with a 2-4-D base, which will only kill the weeds and not your grass.








, Mow your lawn down to a height of 1 to 1 1/2 inches (2.54 to 3.81 cm) in order to minimize competition from grasses already established in your lawn. Mowing the lawn short will also help keep grass seeds from getting trapped in tall grass and will allow more sunlight to reach the new seedlings.








, Thatch is a layer of mostly dead organic matter on the top of the soil.You should also remove all grass clippings after mowing your lawn. A heavy layer of thatch or cut grass will keep seeds from germinating, as seeds need to be in direct contact with the soil in order to germinate.









Go over the top of your soil lightly with a thatch rake. This process is called ""dethatching."" If you can't find a thatch rake, you can use a leaf rake, although you may have to rake a little harder in order to remove the thatch.
You may be able to rent a gas-powered dethatching machine from your local hardware rental center. This will save you a lot of time and hard labor.

, Options for loosening the soil include roto-tilling, aerating, heavy raking, or using the dethatching machine.









Although roto-tilling is common practice when seeding a new lawn, it is also helpful for overseeding. The only difference between roto-tilling before overseeding and before planting a new lawn is the depth: overseeding requires only tilling about 1 or 2 inches into the soil, while new lawns require 4 to 6 inches.
Aerate the soil using a broadfork, being careful not to break the underlying structure of the soil too much. Breaking the soil open hurts the root structure of the existing grass and gives new weeds a chance to invade.
If you have a large area to aerate, consider renting a gas-powered aerator.

, The ideal pH level is between 6.0 and 6.8. If you don't know how to perform a pH test, you have two options:









You can buy a kit and perform the test yourself, according to direction on the labeling.
You can hire a professional or ask your local city to perform a pH test for you.
While this step is not essential to overseeding, it can mean the difference between a successful project or a waste of your time and hard work. You can risk skipping this step, but it is usually worth it in the long-run.

, Lime will help balance out the pH, if necessary. Carefully follow the instructions on the packaging to determine the amount of lime needed based on the pH and the size of your lawn.








, Topdressing is the process of adding a thin layer of compostable material to the top of the lawn. The compost will help the seeds germinate and give the seedlings added nutrients to help them thrive.









Lay a very thin layer of compost over the entire surface of the lawn. Too little is better than too much. Too much compost and your existing grass will effectively be buried under compost and die.
Spread the compost out evenly over the entire surface of the lawn with a rake, preferably a thatch rake. Make sure that compost does not remain on the top of the grass. Remember to rake lightly when spreading the compost with your rake.

, Use the amount specified on the seed packaging, based on the size of your lawn. To seed, you can either use a rotary spreader, a drop spreader, a hand spreader, or spread by hand.









Make sure you choose a variety of seed that blends nicely with your existing lawn. Bermuda grass might be great, but it probably doesn't blend all that nicely with Fine Fescues.
It's best to stay away from cheaper brands of seed. You really get what you pay for. If you decide to economize too much, your lawn may carry the telltale sign.

, Remember that any seeds that do not come into direct contact with the soil will not germinate.








, Make sure you use a fertilizer that's appropriate for your specific lawn conditions, as indicated by the soil sample results.









Put a light layer of topdressing over the seeds. Use the back of a leaf rake and lightly rake or tamp the topdressing.

, Continue to water the lawn frequently, three to four times daily for at least the first several weeks to ensure proper germination — the key is to keep the seeds moist. Never let the seeds get completely dried out. Once the grass seed is firmly established, water the lawn for longer periods less frequently.









In the beginning, it helps for the seeds to be moist or damp almost around the clock. This will help them germinate. After they have germinated, too much water can eventually kill the seedlings.

, Use a quick-release fertilizer at a rate of about 1 lb (.45 kg) per 1,000 square feet about five weeks after the seeds have germinated. Spread another application of quick-release nitrogen fertilizer six weeks later.









Do not overuse the nitrogen fertilizer. Too much nitrogen can burn the new germination and seedlings.

, Continue to mow the lawn to a height of 2 inches (5.08 cm) for the remainder of the season.

Be familiar with palm trees.,
Know your particular palm.,
Tie at least 5 pieces up the trunk of the palm tree with a rope.,
Mark a circle at the base of the tree.,
Start digging at the circle’s edges, going inward.,
Cut through the roots, once you find them.,
Dig beneath the root ball to free it.,
Lower the tree as you go.",How to Remove a Palm Tree," There are several species of palm trees that reside in the United States. To name some of them, there is Phoenix roebelenii or the pygmy date palms, Sabal palmetto or the Sabal palms, Phoenix canaries, Phoenix reclinata, and Archontophoenix cunninghamiana. If you are in the process of renovating your garden and you have one of these species, revising them won’t be as easy as removing them.


Compared to broad-leaf trees that palms are similar in size with, palm trees are fairly easy to remove from the garden. Unlike broad-leaf trees that have fewer roots, palm trees have a great deal of stingy roots, which are generated continuously from the base of the trunk. These roots do not spread very far, compared to the roots of broad-leaf trees.;
, Palm Trees have several species, so you need to find out what specie your palm tree belongs to. The root system of a palm tree depends on its specie. Some have larger diameters compared to others. Knowing its specie will give you an idea on what strategy to use when removing it.


If you can’t determine its specie, base it from the height of the tree - the taller the tree, the larger the diameter of the roots.

, This step is needed in case the tree topples and causes damage, especially if it’s large enough. Make sure to tie all ropes at an equivalent distance. Use a strong metal to secure all ends to the ground. Make sure that all ropes are tight enough to hold the tree when it falls.

, Make an estimate of the radius. If you have plans of transferring the tree, or replanting it in another area, create a bigger circle, to ensure that larger roots are removed as well.

, Don’t expect to find the roots immediately as a palm tree’s roots are inverted, not like the usual trees.

, Use a sharp tool like a hoe or a shovel. Make sure to dig deeper to find all roots and cut through it, until you find the root ball.

, Continue digging until you reach the base of the trunk. Dig deeper to loosen it.

, The tree could be lowered at this time. So ask helpers to assist you in holding the ropes. Choose 2 ropes to untie, and then lower down the tree slowly.

Sometimes, it can be the result of drainage problems (usually this depends on how long the lawn has been established), or even broken water pipes. If your lawn had major work done on it in the last few years, and it's bumpy everywhere, then that's normal. If, however, there are two to three low spots around areas where there may be water or drainage pipes, you should consult an expert to make sure that nothing is leaking.


You can investigate a little by turning off the water and then watching your water meter. Notice if it is very slowly turning. If you are using a well, watch the pump cycles.;
, A sprinkler system that is not operating properly is often the cause of a bumpy lawn. Be sure and check the system out before beginning lawn rehabilitation process. Check that the spray heads and rotors are working correctly and popping up to the full height (this is usually about 4 inches), that the nozzles are not clogged or damaged, and that the heads are not leaking.









Remember a sprinkler system requires upkeep at least once a year, if not more often. Most repairs and upkeep can be done without professional assistance if you do a little research and know the brand of sprinkler or irrigation system you are using.

, Are you leveling just a few small spots or is your yard a, as the kids say, ""hot mess""? If you have a seriously bumpy yard, it may be better to start from scratch. Decide what you want to do before wasting a bunch of time and effort.


You may not realize it, but your yard has a life that will slowly come to an end. If this is the case, starting over by sodding or seeding your yard.

, A level lawn is all well and good but you also want to think about the grade of your lawn. Experts recommend sloping your yard away from your house to help with drainage. While working on leveling, you might want to consider re-grading as well, if you have drainage issues.








, If the low spots are fairly shallow, you should be fine. However, if they're deep, it may be easier to take out the grass at that spot before filling it in.









You can easily measure the depth of the low spots by placing a long, straight edge over the low spot, then using a ruler against that straight edge to take your measurement. If the spot is 3 inches (7.6 cm) or less it is considered a shallow low spot. Greater than 3 inches (7.6 cm) is considered deep.

, For basic repairs, try to time them for the spring. This will allow your grass seed time to grow in and will also provide the moisture necessary to help set the soil.








, Get some high quality topsoil from a good gardening store or soil supply company. Good soil will be crucial for getting your lawn to stay even and your grass to grow back.








, A bit of sand, also purchased from a soil supply company, will help give your mixture the right consistency to stay in place, keeping low spots from returning.








, You'll also want to make sure that your soil is nutrient rich, to help ensure your grass grows back healthy and quickly.








, Mix them together at a ratio of of two parts topsoil, two parts sand, and one part compost.








, Find the low spots in your yard and add the mixture you made to the spots, adding in just a little more than is necessary to even them out — ""feather"" the mixture in all directions and over all the edges.








, Use a rake to spread the mixture evenly and fill out the spot.








, Use your feet and the end of the rake to tamp down the soil, compacting it. You can also rent a tamper from your local major hardware store. This piece of equipment will work even better to make sure those spots don't come back.








, Lightly water the soil to help further compact.








, Give the soil plenty of time to settle. At least a few days, preferably a week or more.








, Get some grass seed appropriate for your lawn and area where you live and then get a hand spreader to help distribute the seed, especially if you have a fair amount of area to cover. Distribute the seeds, being careful not to go overboard.

, Sprinkle just a bit of topsoil over the seeds. You want to cover the grass seed with 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) of topdressing, which allows for good soil contact and moisture-holding coverage.This will also help deter birds from eating your seed.








, With your hand, pat down the soil you've added. Remember that the seed has to make contact with the soil, as well as coverage, or it can dry out between waterings and will not grow.


If seeding a larger area, use a lawn roller that is half filled.

, Water this soil with a light spray four times a day for the next 48 hours at least to help the seeds germinate.








, Give the grass time to grow in. It may seem like it is taking ages, but be patient. Grass will usually appear within 21 to 30 days, if not sooner. If there are still bare spots, add more grass seed as necessary. Enjoy your smooth lawn!









Wait for grass to grow to at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) height, if not longer, before mowing. Lawn mowers will pull your new grass right out of the soil if it has not had time to root.

",How to Mow a Lawn,";
, Check the air filter for debris; cleaning or replacing if necessary.

, to ensure the life of mower blades.

, If you purchased a reel mower, simply begin pushing, and the reel will begin spinning to snip the grass.

, Doing this will establish a perimeter of the yard so the when you start mowing you can see where you have to go. Another reason why you should snip first is the mower will then pick up all the mess the snipper has made, making it look professional.

, Don't miss any grass because it will look unprofessional.

, Work steadily and aim straight toward the uncut grass. When you reach the end of that row and turn around, pick another line on the other end to aim for when mowing. This will help keep you in a straight line.

, If you put your wheel on top of the line you already made, you will barely miss any grass.

Clean up.",How to Mow a Lawn Professionally," While you do not want to mow when there is morning dew still on the grass, it's a good idea to avoid the hottest times of day if you live in a warmer climate. Heat exhaustion can be incredibly dangerous and should always be taken into account.
, Different types of grass require different heights of cut. Identify your type of grass before you set your mower height. People can be very picky about how their grass is cut.

, This should include a lawn mower, weed whipper, edger, and leaf blower., Most mowers require you to choke it. (Let air flow travel by pulling a handle) once done push back in and turn up the speed, also don't forget to take the brake off when ready to move.,, This is done so when you make your lines you can turn around and not worry about missing any patches., When mowing it's suggested to use a different direction each time. Switch up how you are cutting, whether it's vertically, horizontally or overlapping rows, until you are sure that all the grass is even. One thing that's important to remember is to always push your mower forward not backwards. Mowing backwards could be dangerous and unsafe. When beginning the cut, for quality preference, make your lines in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal., You have to come in turn whatever way your next strip is, back up and then follow through so there is no rough turning. When making your lines, stay as straight as possible to make it look good., Before mowing it is important to check for any debris that may be on the lawn, any debris can damage the lawn mower. Firstly, make two passes around the edge of the lawn. Remember to overlap the passes, there will be uncut areas of lawn if there isn't enough overlap.

, Even when you are not using your lawn mower it is important to keep your mower well-maintained all throughout the year. Just like your car you need to be sure that all of the parts of your mower are working correctly before you start the cutting process. If the blades of your mower are not sharp, it could damage you lawn; leaving areas brown and susceptible to disease., After 2 passes go back and forth in any direction, it is important to alternate the mowing direction each time the lawn gets mown. If you do not alternate the direction you can cause excessive wear, or damage the lawn.

, Once you have cut your area(s), just to make sure, take a look to see if it may be need to cut twice if there are clumps of grass or doesn't look good, put the mower back on the trailer and grab an edger (If not blacktop because blacktop does not get edged). An edger is a tool that cut the grass that comes over the concrete on the sides of the driveways and walk ways. It also needs to be choked when started along with the rest of the tools.

Cut the grass around flower beds, trees, and any areas the mower was unable to mow at approximately the same height as the mower. Be careful not to damage the bark at the base of the trees, and do not cut the grass too low or damage will occur.







, Weed Whip over the edged grass because after you edge it, the grass tends to stand taller, which becomes noticeable. Also weed whip areas which the mower could not get which could be: sides of houses, around trees, sheds, beds, etc…., Grab a leaf blower and begin to blow off any unwanted grass and remaining dirt from the street, sidewalk, drive way, walk ways, or beds. Place all the equipment back properly so nothing gets broken or any fluids don't spill over."

Understand why leaf mold makes a good mulch.,
Decide how to use your leaf mulch.,
Use leaf mulch as a lawn improver.,
Use leaf mulch elsewhere in your garden.",How to Mulch Leaves with a Lawn Mower," You can use any kind of rotary-action garden lawn mower to mulch leaves. Two types of lawnmower that are work particularly well for this task are high power mulching lawnmowers and side-discharge lawn mower.If you want to leave the leaf mulch on the lawn to improve your grass, take the grass catcher or bag off the lawn mower, being very careful of the blade.
However, if you want to use the mulch elsewhere, you may want to leave the grass catcher attached to the mower, as this saves you the effort of raking up the mulch afterwards.





;
, If you plan to leave the mulch on the lawn, distribute the leaves over the whole area. Use a rake to spread them out over the entire surface of the lawn. If you're lucky, the trees may have already done this for you!


If you plan to remove the leaf mold for use elsewhere, consider raking the leaves up into a smaller area. That way, after mowing you will have less area to cover when gathering the leaf mold.






Alternately, you can leave the grass catcher on the lawn mower and scoop the leaf mold out of there. You may need to keep emptying this, depending on how much leaf litter you have.







, You’ll want to cut the leaves into pieces about the size of a dime.You may need to pass the mower over the leaves several times to achieve this. Try making the second pass at right angles to the first.

, If you plan on leaving the leaf mulch on the lawn a one inch layer is ideal, as it will wash down with the rain and decompose over time.


If the mulch is still too thick on your lawn, try reattaching your grass catcher or bag and passing over it again – this will gather up some of the mulch.






Alternately, you can rake some of it up and use it elsewhere.







, It’s a good idea to feed your lawn at the same time as mulching it – you’ll notice the difference in springtime. A winter blend fertilizer is a good choice in the fall. These fertilizers that have a high proportion of potassium relative to other ingredients., Leaf mold is a good garden mulch as it is freely available and breaks down easily, as well as offering all the properties of a regular mulch, such as keeping weeds down, protecting the plant roots through colder months, and keeping moisture in the soil.

, You have two choices when it comes to using your leaf mulch. Either leave it in place on the lawn, where it will help to improve the lawn, or rake it up or catch it in the grass catcher on your mower and use it elsewhere in the garden. You can use leaf mulch over any kind of plant, hedge or shrub.

, If you leave the mulch leaves on your lawn after mowing, you’ll be doing it a favor. It will improve the soil and add some nutrients.


Although fallen leaves will mulch the lawn naturally, mulching the with the mower helps them to break down (decompose) faster, especially if they are mixed in with grass clippings. This will happen naturally if you use a mower to make the mulch.
Fall is a good time to do this, as the leaf mulch will also protect the grass roots over winter.

, Leaf mold also makes a great mulch for garden plants. Apply it under plants, shrubs and hedges in a layer 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) thick. You may need to water the plants first if the weather has been dry recently.


If you are replacing a mulch layer from the previous year, remove any old mulch before you apply a fresh layer.
Leaf mulch is also good for adding to the compost heap.

Maintain your lawn to keep it free of weeds.",How to Lay Sod," If you've had trouble growing healthy grass in the past, the problem is probably related to the makeup of your soil. If it has a lot of tightly-packed clay, the grass roots aren't able to get the oxygen they need to grow. If it has too much sand, it won't hold water and nutrients near the roots. Grass grows best in loamy, fertile soil that drains well, and you'll need to amend the soil to fit that description. You can take a soil sample to your local nursery and ask an expert to help you determine its composition, or do it yourself by digging a hole in your yard and filling it with water. Watch what happens:



Sandy soil will drain in a split second. This means you'll need to work in 2 inches (5.1 cm) of extra compost or topsoil to hold nutrients around the grass roots.

Clay-packed soil holds water and drains very slowly. Plan to work in 2 inches (5.1 cm) of extra organic matter like peat moss, composted animal manure, composted leaves or yard waste so the grass roots won't suffocate.;
, The alkalinity of the soil will also greatly affect how well your grass grows. Take a few soil samples from multiple locations, both near the surface and at a depth of 6 to 8 inches (15–20 cm). Label them well to keep them distinct, then send them to your local agricultural extension or a soil testing lab. Allow two weeks to receive the results.


If the soil has pH of 6 or below, it's too acidic. This can be amended with the addition of lime. Talk with an expert at the garden center to determine exactly how much lime you need to add, or contact a turf professional.
If the soil has a pH of 6.5 or higher, it's too alkaline for grass. This can be amended with the addition of sulfur or gypsum. To find out exactly how much you need to add, talk with a professional.

, Remove lawn decorations, large sticks and rocks, and anything else that could get in the way. Take out bricks and construction materials, too. Remove anything larger than about 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter so that the tiller won't catch on objects as you work the yard.

, For best results, use a complete vegetation herbicide at least two weeks (if not longer) prior to beginning the project. This will kill all undesirable weeds and help prohibit re-growth.

, If you have a ditch, an uneven hill or a big hole in your yard, it'll be more difficult to lay the sod neatly. Rough grading levels out the ground, creating a smooth surface and helping eliminate drainage problems. It's not absolutely mandatory, but it's a good idea if you want to go the distance to get the perfect lawn.


To rough grade a large area, use a tractor mounted blade. They're quite expensive to purchase, but you can rent one from a home and garden store.For smaller areas, you can rough grade by hand. Use hand tools like garden hoes or large landscaping rakes to break up the soil and soften the edges and slopes around holes and ditches.

, Borrow, rent or buy a soil tiller you can use to loosen the top 6 inches (15.2 cm) of soil in your yard. Tilling the soil loosens it up so that the roots of the grass you lay can breathe and get established. Till the soil using the same method you'd use to mow the lawn, loosening it row by row in sections. Go in a different direction with each pass for a more even surface.


Tilling the soil not only prepares it for the grass you're about to lay, it also helps with weed control by turning over the weeds that are about to sprout.
If your soil is especially compact and laden with clay, till to a depth of 8 inches (20.3 cm) instead of 6, to make sure the grass roots will have plenty of space to grow without getting compacted.

, Use a good-quality topsoil or compost to provide a rich bed on which to lay the sod. If you determined that your soil needs extra compost, organic matter, lime or sulfur to achieve the right conditions, spread it at the same time. Run the tiller over the yard once more to mix in the compost, topsoil and other amendments.You can spread the topsoil, compost and amendments by hand or using a rented soil spreading machine.

, This last step ensures that the sod you lay will have all the nutrients it needs to get a healthy start. High-phosphate starter fertilizer is usually recommended.Lay it evenly and work it into the soil according to the instructions that come with the packaging.

, Use a measuring tape to measure the length and width of the lawn. Multiply the two together to get your lawn's area. Try to get exact measurements so you purchase the right amount of sod. Too little sod will result in an uneven-looking lawn that doesn't grow in as healthy as it should. Too much sod can get very expensive, since it usually runs about $0.40 per square foot.If your lawn is not rectangular, sketch your lawn and divide it into rectangles, triangles, or other easily measured sections. Find the area of each section and add them all together.

, Choose a company that other people in your area have used before with successful results. The company should provide you with a few different options as to what type of grass will do well in your region. Don't be tempted to order from a faraway place just because it showcases beautiful grass on its website; chances are, the grass won't establish well in your climate. Choose a good company and talk with sales representatives to make a smart choice about what grass to grow.


It's best to choose a grass that's native to your area. This way you can ensure it will grow well in your climate. Cool season grasses (grasses that grow fastest in the spring and fall) like Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, and fine fescue grow best in the northern US states, where the winters are cold and the summers are hot. Warm season grasses (grasses that thrive in very hot weather) like Bermuda grass, centipedegrass, St. Augustinegrass, bahiagrass, and zoysiagrass, grow best in the southern states and subtropical regions.
When you're deciding which grass to get, take use into account as well. Do you plan to walk over your grass frequently, and play sports or have parties on the lawn? Or do you just want a pretty lawn to gaze upon from the window? Some varieties are sturdy, some are soft, some are high maintenance, and some are more colorful than others. Tell the sales representative what you're looking for.
Ask the representative whether they cut and deliver their sod the same day. Sod that sits around for several days before delivery won't be as fresh and healthy.

, It's important to lay sod the same day it's delivered. Waiting too long will give the sod time to dry out, and can damage the roots. Give your sod the best chance to grow healthy by laying it as soon as it comes. It'll be delivered to you in long rolls, and the entire process of laying it should only take a day.


Sod is quite heavy and usually comes on a heavy duty pallet in amounts of 450 square feet or more. A single pallet of sod can weigh over a ton (2,000 lbs), so a half ton pickup truck will not carry it well. Before placing your order, check whether there is a minimum delivery amount, and whether the sod farm or nursery can transport it to your site.

, In order for the sod to establish, it's best to start with freshly watered soil. It doesn't need to be soaking wet; just use a sprinkler to lightly moisten everything before you get started.

, Unroll the first piece of sod next to a driveway or a street. Line it up so that the edge of the sod is exactly aligned with the edge of the yard, with no extra dirt exposed. Carefully unroll the entire piece of sod so that the first long edge is covered. This provides a strong edge against which you'll lay the rest of the sod.


Starting from the middle instead will make it tricky to lay the sod in a logical matter without leaving any gaps or short ends.
Make sure to roll each piece of sod in the same direction. If you roll a piece in reverse it will look very different from its neighbor, although they will eventually grow to an even appearance.

, Cut the second strip of sod in half lengthwise, and lay it directly adjacent to the first. Keep laying sod in a staggered, brick-like pattern. Laying sod in this fashion will make the seams less apparent later.Make sure that the edges of the sod butt up against each other without overlapping. Don't leave gaps at the seams; these exposed edges will be prone to drying out and leaving brown spots in the yard. Continue laying sod in this manner until the entire yard is covered and no seams are visible.


Use a box cutter to cut shorter pieces of sod where you need to fill in gaps or lay sod around corners.
However, leave the sod pieces as large as possible. Don't cut them into smaller pieces unless you need to, since the smaller pieces are more prone to drying out before they get established.
Seam all the edges by firmly rolling them together.
Avoid walking or kneeling on the sod as you lay it, since this can cause air pockets and indentations to form.

, Laying the sod horizontally across the hills, rather than vertically along the hills, will prevent the hill from eroding. When the grass roots establish themselves they'll hold the dirt underneath in place. If you lay them vertically, especially on steep hills, you might encounter problems with the strips of sod bunching toward the bottom instead of staying in place on the hill.


If needed, purchase sod or landscape ""fabric staples"" to pin the sod in place. Be sure to mark them clearly or paint them a visible color for removal once the sod has rooted.

, Since the key is to keep the sod in large pieces whenever possible, you can lay around curves by reshaping it instead of cutting it apart. Drape a large piece of sod next to the curve and pinch it together in a few spots so that the shape of the piece wraps neatly around the curve. Use your cutter to chop off the the raised areas that you pinched, and set aside the two smaller triangular pieces. Now you've essentially created two darts in the sod, allowing it to take on a semi-circular shape. Pull the cut edges of the darts together so that they lay right next to each other, with no gap remaining., If you encounter a tree or another obstacle you need to lay the sod around, drape it over the object and carefully cut the sod so that it fits around the object's base. Save the cutouts so you can use them if you have any small gaps to fill in later.


If you're laying sod around a tree, don't lay it right up against the tree's base. Laying it over the roots could damage the tree. Instead, cut out a circle so that the edge of the sod is a few feet from the tree.If you have a lot of trees or other obstacles to work around, you might want to get a sod cutter to make the job a little easier. Cutting shapes out of the sod using just a box cutter can get time consuming.

, Fill a lawn roller ¾ full of water and walk it over the entire sod. This presses down the sod to ensure good root contact with the soil before watering.

, Keeping the grass moist during the first few weeks is essential. During this time, the grass roots are establishing and growing. Without plenty of water, this process will slow or halt, and the sod die before it takes. After the first two weeks, water the grass a few times a week to keep it from drying out.


Use a sprinkler system to ensure the grass gets evenly watered.
Don't wait until the grass looks brown to water it. Do a soil test by sticking your finger into the dirt. If the soil feels moist to a depth of several inches, it's fine. If the dirt feels dry on the surface or to a depth of an inch or two, it's time to water it.
Shade-grown grass should be watered less frequently, since it holds dew longer.
Water just to the point of puddling, then stop. If the sod lifts up off the soil, it has been overwatered.

, Mowing before the roots are well established can pull them out of the soil and damage your sod. Wait patiently until the grass is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall, and gently pull up on several areas of sod to confirm it is firmly attached. Once the lawn is ready, mow it down to no shorter than ⅔ of its height, and never below 2 inches (5 cm).


Always be sure the mower blades are sharp, straight and clean, Mow in a different directional pattern each time the grass is mowed to ensure even growth.
You can bag the clippings, but leaving them on the lawn will actually improve its health, since they act as free fertilizer.

, Use the same starter fertilizer to dress the lawn after a month has passed. This is necessary to replace the nutrients that may have been washed away during a month of heavy watering. After the first month, you need only fertilize your grass once or twice a season to replace nutrients in the years to come.

, Keeping up with watering, mowing and fertilizing your lawn is the best way to grow thick, healthy grass, and it's also the best way to keep weeds away. Weeds tend to move in when the grass gets patchy. They're nature's way of covering up bare spots in the ground. If you make sure there aren't bare spots to begin with, you won't have to worry much about weeds.


If you notice an area where the sod seems to be dead, replace it as soon as possible. Tear up the old sod, enrich the soil underneath with compost, and add fresh sod, making sure the seams lay right next to the healthy grass on either side. This will prevent weeds from coming up where the sod is dead.

Spread a fertilizer over the prepared ground.





;
, Pound wooden stakes into the ground at each corner of the yard and use string or builder’s line to outline where you will be placing the turf.

, Start with a single roll of turf and unroll it so the longest side is parallel to the longest edge of the lawn.

Stagger each roll of turf as you go along to avoid a single line of edges or joints across the lawn. Some compare staggering turfs to the way you would stagger bricks when putting up a brick wall.






Use a knife or blade to cut the rolls of turf as needed.






Butt one edge of turf up against another. Use a rake to pull edges close to one another. Do not overlap turfs.







, Cut pieces of turfs you have trimmed to fill in large gaps. Also repair any hollow spots under turfs by lifting and filling with topsoil.

, It is recommended that the first watering should soak the layer of topsoil or ground the turf is installed upon.

, It is not necessary to soak the topsoil after the first watering, as this can cause soil damage. Cut back on the frequency of watering once you can pull up on a turf without it lifting.

Make the forms you need to use for the concrete bricks.,
Assemble the forms with the two 48 inch (1.2 m) pieces laid parallel.,
Use a spray can of form release oil to aid in stripping the forms after pouring the concrete into the brick molds.

",How to Make Bricks from Concrete1," This requires basic carpenter tools and a sheet of .75-inch (19 mm) plywood along with 2 x 4-inch (5.1 x 10.2 cm) by 8 feet (2.4 m) lumber. Use 9 x 4 x 3.5 inches (22.9 x 10.2 x 8.9 cm) for your brick dimensions.


Rip the sheet of 3/4 inch plywood down to 12-inch (30.5 cm) wide x 48-inch (1.2 m) long strips. This will give you 8 bricks per strip, and the entire sheet of plywood will give you a total of 64 bricks.
Cut the side forms down to 2 x 4 inches (5.1 x 10.2 cm). You will need 2 pieces at 48 inches (1.2 m) long for each strip. There will be 9 pieces, 9 inches (22.9 cm) in length.;
, Begin nailing the 9-inch (22.9 cm) pieces between the two 48-inch (1.2 M) strips using either double-headed 16 penny concrete form nails or 3-inch (7.65 cm) deck screws. When finished, you should have 8 spaces 4 inches (5.1cm) wide, 9 inches (22.9 cm) long, and 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) deep.


Lay the strips of plywood on a flat level area and spread plastic sheeting over it to keep the concrete from bonding with the plastic. The work area will need to be left undisturbed for at least 24 hours.
Place the assembled side form on top of the .75-inch (19 cm) plastic covered plywood strip. Either nail the side forms to the plywood or drive wooden stakes around the sides of the forms to keep the forms from shifting off of the plywood bottom strips.

Research local code for the minimum distance between septic sources and water sources, plus any other restrictions on size or depth.;
, There are many different types of outhouse designs, some of them simpler than others. Before building, decide how many seats you want, and whether you will separate stalls by sex.


Know the weather in your area. A screen fronted outhouse is fine for most summers, but won't do you much good in an Alaska winter.






Consider who will be using the privy. For instance, if a parent has to accompany a child, make sure that there is room to accommodate them.






While most outhouses are rectangular in shape, they can vary in comfort and size. They can either simply have a hole in the floor of the outhouse over which one squats, or they can have an actual seat to sit upon. All outhouses should have some form of ventilation and preferably something with which to wipe. Building a shelf in the outhouse can provide a place for toilet paper and a few magazines and hand sanitizers. It's a good opportunity to get creative!







, For your safety, locate all utility lines before you start digging. In the US and Canada, you can call 811 to request a utility location service., It's absolutely essential to do this part first since you won't be able to dig the hole once the structure of the outhouse is already finished. There is no set width and depth for the hole, but you'll probably want it bigger than 2 feet (0.6 m) x 2 feet (0.6 m). 4 feet (1.2 m) x 5 feet (1.5 m) seems to work well for a two-seater.


Make sure the walls of the hole are even, this will be important for creating the foundation.






You'll need a bigger hole if you want more than one seat in the outhouse.






Make sure you consider where your water source is and what your area's laws are on outhouses.







, This frame will go into the hole you just dug. There are as many different kinds of foundations as there are outhouse types.


One way is to wrap a wooden structure (like a box) in tar paper and place it in the hole. This will keep out the moisture. Once the box is in, level the ground around the hole and create a foundation of treated wood around the hole. This will be the structure on which you build your floor and your outhouse structure.






You can purchase a precast concrete vault, or, if you have some building experience, pour a 4 inches (10.2 cm) thick concrete ring between wooden forms. Reinforce the concrete with a steel rod with eye and anchor bolts. A complete concrete pit with form boards removed can be pumped out by a septic service.






A portable ""skid foundation"" built from pressure-treated timber allows you to move the outhouse as needed, or even attach it to a trailer., You have to first make the frame out of timbers (based on the size of your outhouse) before placing the plywood sheets over the frame. You can build directly on top of your foundation, or you can build it elsewhere and place it full completed on the foundation. The frame can be a simple square of four timbers, or use additional timbers for reinforcement.


Use pressure-treated timbers or untreated hemlock, which has a natural resistance to decay. If you reuse old railroad ties, be aware that they may contain creosote, which requires special handling and disposal.If you do use pressure-treated timbers remember to treat the cut ends with a preservative.






Build the floor out of two or three plywood sheets, nailed together and nailed to the frame. Use plywood thick enough to hold people's weight (meeting subfloor specifications). Make sure you cut out a rectangular section for the privy seat!






Install sub-framing to support the plywood floor, spanning across the frame. Screw and nail the plywood floor onto this.

, You'll need to use at least 6 inch (15.2 cm) by 6 inch (15.2 cm) timbers in framing the hole. The amount of timbers, their length and width will be determinate on the size of your chosen outhouse.For a strong corner remember to nail not only the outside corners together, but to also nail through the outer frame corner into the inner frame. You can also use long lag bolts. These require pre-drilled holes using an appropriately sized drill bit.






The cheapest and easiest way of building the walls is to use 2 x 4 lumber and cover it with plywood panels to make a fast, easy structure.






For a more expensive but more solid outhouse, you can build thicker walls and add a diagonal brace. If you live in a cold place and intend on using the outhouse year round, you may want to consider insulation and/or electrical installation for heat and light.






Secure the walls to the floor. Apply construction glue to the underside of the bottom plate to seal the walls to the foundation before nailing or screwing them down.







, Put plywood on top and secure it. From here you can cover it with roll roofing, asphalt shingles or metal panels over some 2x4s. Some people get fancy with their roofs and add gables and trim, but this is a difficult process.


A lip over the front of the outhouse offers a little protection against rain when leaving the outhouse.






If you expect muddy conditions, place a sturdy, removable step or landing in front of the outhouse.

, You can get a commercial seat and attach it over the rectangular opening you left in the flooring. Or you can build a seat out of wood. For the wooden seat you can make one out of 2x4 lumber or plywood and add a toilet seat.


The height of the seat will depend on your needs. If you have a child, constructing a child seat can be useful in helping them use the outhouse.







, Install two small windows or openings to cross-ventilate for smell and air. Add screens to keep out flies. Prevent people looking inside by installing the windows high up on the walls, or by installing a simple hinged shutter you can close from the inside.

, Keep a small, covered container nearby full of wood ashes, lime, untreated sawdust, coconut coir, or peat moss. Toss a handful of this material into the pit after each use to help the decomposition process. These carbon-rich materials absorb liquid and create an odor barrier.


Keep a small trash can with a lid in the outhouse to dispose of menstrual pads, tampons, and other objects that do not decompose easily.
To help keep the pit clear, use biodegradable toilet paper or dispose of toilet paper in a covered trash can for later burning.







, This is an important job, because it helps keep the area from contamination. If you've been using the wood ashes method outlined above the refuse should resemble something you'd put on your garden and shouldn't be too difficult or disgusting to handle.


Some people have a space created at the back of the privy with a sort of gate which they can open and rake out the refuse. This often requires that an outhouse is built into a hillside, or on a high foundation. Once you've raked it out, you will need to bury it somewhere on the property at least 30 feet (9.1 m) away from a water source or runoff.By this point the contents of the outhouse will be more like fertilizer than anything else and you can use them, but only if you've been following the composting toilet guidelines.






You may have to dig the refuse out of the hole. To do this you'll need to dismantle the seat and use a manual post-hole auger or digger to remove the contents below. If you don't have an auger you can use a shovel, but the auger is the best tool and if you're going to have an outhouse is something that you should invest in.






The third option is to dig a new hole for the outhouse. You'll need to follow the directions above, but you already have the outhouse itself!







, Many old-time outhouses used to be covered by flowers to make them smell nice and give it an attractive appearance. There's no sustainable reason to do this except for attractive aesthetics."

Strip the forms from the concrete bricks on the next day.,
Finished.

",How to Make Bricks from Concrete2," This will most likely be the most physically challenging part of making brick from concrete. Using a commercially prepared dry mix of concrete materials is the easiest method. It is often referred to as Sak-crete and normally comes in 40-to-80-pound (18.1-to-36.2 kg) bags, which are then mixed in a wheelbarrow.

, Make a small hole in the middle of the dry mix using a shovel or a common garden hoe.


Begin adding small amounts of water in that small hole, preferably from a bucket rather than a hose for better control of the amount of water that is added at any one time.
Mix the dry material and water together with the hoe or shovel, adding water until you have a concrete consistency that is workable. Too wet and it will want to push up the side and run under the forms. Too dry and it will not want to consolidate, but rather it will leave air voids in your concrete brick.

,


Tap on the side of the forms with the brick forms filled. Tapping on the top afterward will force any trapped air out from inside of the concrete.
Use a straight edge or 12-inch (30.5 cm) trowel to smooth off the top of the concrete level with the top of the forms. Allow it to dry for 24 hours.

, Stack the bricks in a cool area to cure a suggested 2 weeks. Cover them up with a mover's blanket while they are curing and keep the blanket wet and covered with plastic sheeting. This will keep the bricks from cracking during the curing process. Once they have cured, you are ready to use them.

Add your profit to the rest of your income.",How to Pay Tax on Rental Property," In tax lingo, your capital assets are items of property that you expect to use for more than one year.In addition to the rental property itself, capital assets for a rental property may include furniture and appliances in the unit, as well as office or construction equipment and vehicles.
Trees, shrubs, or other greenery that you plant around the property generally are considered capital assets. However, the land itself is not.
If you're unsure whether something should be depreciated or deducted in full, think in terms of how it will be used and when it will be replaced.
For example, cleaning supplies will be used until they are gone, and then refilled or replaced. In contrast, a sofa would be a capital asset. Sitting on it may cause wear over time, but it doesn't deplete the sofa itself, and you typically don't replace it unless it's broken or dilapidated.;
, Your cost basis generally is the amount you paid for your assets when you purchased them.If you purchased the asset strictly for business use, your basis in that asset typically will be the amount you paid for it.
If you originally purchased the asset for personal use and later converted it to business use, your basis usually will be the fair market value of that item at the time of conversion.
For example, if you bought furniture for your condo when you lived there, you originally bought it for personal use. However, when you move to a house you decide to leave some of the furniture in the condo and rent it as a furnished unit. Your basis in that furniture would be the fair market value of the furniture when you put the condo up for rent.

, The type of property refers to the specific components of your rental property as well as the building itself.Typically, the building or structure you're renting will be all or most of your depreciation deduction. This would be categorized as residential real estate.
Another category of property includes outdoor structures such as fences, as well as plants or shrubbery.
Your last property category includes any personal property that you are renting with the unit, such as furniture or appliances, and other office furniture or equipment associated with your rental activities.

, Which depreciation method you are allowed to use depends on how the asset is categorized.Residential real estate is depreciated using the straight line method over a period of 27.5 years. With the straight-line method, you simply divide your cost basis in the property by the number of years.
Shrubbery, fences, and other outdoor property is depreciated using the 150% declining balance method over a period of 15 years.
Furniture, appliances, and other personal property is depreciated using the 200% declining balance method over a period of five years.
For declining balance depreciation, you multiply the percentage rate by the straight-line depreciation calculation. However, your basis in the property is adjusted each year you have the property in service.
The declining balance method is extremely complicated to calculate by hand. Fortunately, the IRS has tables of percentages you can use to make your calculations simpler.

, Using the IRS's depreciation tables, subtract the allowable percentage from your basis in the property to find the amount you can deduct each year.Depreciation tables are found in IRS Publication 946, available at https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946/ar02.html.
The percentage listed is the amount of your cost basis that you can deduct for that year.
For example, if your cost basis in your rental house is $150,000, you could deduct $5,455 in depreciation each year for 27.5 years.

, Generally you can deduct any expenses you incurred as a result of renting out your property.Your office expenses are deductible just as they are for any other business. You also can deduct the costs of any travel or meals associated with your rental business.
Insurance premiums, as well as any losses from theft or catastrophic events such as floods or fires also are generally tax deductible. However, you typically won't be able to deduct the entire cost of the property damaged. This depends on whether the loss was covered by insurance.
You can deduct amounts you paid for repairs, but make sure your repair doesn't cross the line into the improvement category. Generally, expenses are considered improvements if they result in betterment, restoration, or adaptation of something to a new use.For example, if the roof of your rental property is leaking, you should only have the damaged shingles repaired or replaced rather than getting a whole new roof.

, If the rental property is mortgaged, your mortgage interest can be deducted from the amount of rent you received.If you took out a second mortgage to make improvements on the property, you are able to deduct that interest as well.
You also can deduct interest paid on credit cards for goods or services connected to or used in conjunction with your rental property. For example, if you purchased $3,000 worth of furniture for your rental property and used a credit card, you could deduct the interest charged on that purchase.

, You can deduct any money you paid to anyone to work on your rental property.Make sure you get tax ID numbers for anyone you pay to work on your rental property. You can deduct the amount you paid them.
If you hire independent contractors, you generally must file Form 1099-MISC with the IRS reporting the amount you paid them.
Although you aren't required to file the form if you paid a contractor less than $600 over the course of the year, you can still deduct those payments on your taxes.

, If you used lawyers, accountants, or tax professionals in connection with your rental property, you can deduct their fees.If you have an accountant or tax professional who handles your personal finances and taxes as well as those for your rental property, ask him or her to itemize the bill so you know what portion of the fees to allocate.
You also can deduct any fees you paid to property management companies, real estate agents, or real estate investment advisors.

, If you are an individual taxpayer, you generally need to complete Form 1040 Schedule E to report rental income to the IRS.The IRS makes the form available online at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040se.pdf.
Before you print and fill out the form, make sure it is updated for the year you're filing. The IRS may make changes to the form from year to year.
You also can download instructions for the form at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040se.pdf. Read through the instructions carefully before you fill out the form.

, Generally you must list the physical address of the rental property, the number of days during the year the property was rented, and the type of property it is.There is room on the form for up to three rental properties. If you are renting more than three separate properties, you'll have to file additional schedules. Keep in mind you'll also have to itemize your expenses for each property.
The IRS provides a list of numbers that correspond to the type of property you are renting out. For example, you would enter ""1"" if you are renting out a single family residence such as a house or condo.
If you have multiple rental properties, the type corresponds to the letter next to the address. Enter the number corresponding to the type of property on the line with the same letter as the address.
In other words, if you are renting a house, you would write the address for the house on line A, then enter ""1"" under ""type of property"" on line A.
You also must report the number of days the house was up for rent and the number of days you personally used the property. For example, if you have a vacation home that you rent out for most of the year, but your family uses it for three weeks, you would enter 21 personal use days.

, Your total rental income essentially is the total amount you received in rent that year for the property.The form has columns for income that correspond to the letters on the rental property address lines.
For example, if you are renting two houses, each listed on line A and line B, you would put the rent you received for house A in column A, and the rent you received for house B on line B.

, Enter all of the deductions you are claiming to decrease the amount of rental income you received that is subject to tax.Make sure you're entering your expenses in the appropriate column for each property, if you're renting out more than one property.
Pay attention to the IRS categories and avoid placing expenses on the wrong line. If you're unsure what would be included in certain categories, check the descriptions in the Schedule E instructions.
Once you've entered all your expenses for each column, you will add up the amounts listed on lines 5 through 19 of the form, and enter your total on line 20.
When you subtract line 20 from the rent you entered on line 3, you have your profit or loss on your rental.

, The amount by which your rental income exceeds your deductions is considered taxable profit.If you are renting out more than one property, you must add all of your profits and losses together to get your total rental income or loss.
For example, if you calculated a rental income of $5,000 on your condo, and a loss of $2,000 on your beach house, your total rental income would be $3,000.
Once you've found your total rental income or loss, enter that number on line 17 of your Form 1040. It will be added to your other income to assess your tax liability.

Take safety measures with deep trenches.",How to Make a Trench1," The service will locate any buried power lines, pipes, and other underground utilities. It is vital to wait for this before starting any digging, to avoid serious injury or property damage.

In the U.S. and Canada, you can call the toll-free ""Digline"" number at 811.;
, Knowing the depth, width, and length of your trench will help you save effort and keep your trench the shape you desire. It may help you to mark widths, lengths and route of your trench using stakes and string. If available, you can use sandbags or other markers to outline the path of your trench.


If you are using the trench to install or replace electrical utilities or pipelines, you will want to dig at least 2.5 feet deep in order to protect the pipes from frost, but no deeper than 4 feet.The width of your trench will depend on your pipes, but will likely be narrow.
If you are digging a trench for a sprinkler system, you may only need to dig 9-12 inches deep depending on the height of the sprinkler, and 5 inches wide depending, again, depending on your sprinkler system.Consult the instructions that came with your sprinkler system before installation.

, You’ll need a D-handle sharp shooter shovel and a trenching or clean-out shovel. These can be purchased at any hardware or gardening store. For clearing roots, pruning shear or a Pulaski digging tool can help you quickly remove this obstruction. Wearing gloves will protect your hand from blisters and splinters, and comfortable work boots will provide foot protection and traction.

, Be careful when you dig around trees or other pipes. Roots can add a significant time to your excavation, and a ruptured gas line will require you to call your gas provider immediately.Severed utility lines could also leave you without power until your electric company can fix the problem.


If you're digging near trees, make sure that your trench will not invade the tree’s protected root zone (usually the part of the roots that lie directly below its branches).If you're digging near pipes, try to determine where any other pipes may be. New pipes should be at least 1.5 feet away from another., Use the D-handle shovel to loosen the dirt along both sides of the soon-to-be trench. This will make it easier to dig out the dirt in the middle while physically establishing your dig line alongside the guideline you laid.Cut both sides of the hole with your shovel, break up the topsoil, and then work both sides of your trench until you have loosened enough soil to merit clearing.

, Once you have accumulated enough loose soil, use the trenching shovel to remove it out of your way. This may be a pile off to the side, or it may be a location you choose prior specifically for backfill.

, Depending on the depth and length of your trench, this could take a considerable amount of time and effort. Use your D-handle shovel to break up the soil and the trench shovel to clean it out until your trench is the desired length and depth. Running into roots might require you to place the pointed end of your shovel on the root and stomp, which should sever most small-medium sized roots. More developed root systems might require a Pulaski digging tool.Pruning shears are another good option, if your shovel fails and you do not have a Pulaski digging tool on hand., An unsupported trench can be extremely dangerous, as collapsing soil can kill someone standing in the trench. Any trench 3 feet (0.91 m) (0.9m) deep, and some shallower trenches in soft soil, should be supported by side walls (such as timber posts and panels) before digging any deeper. You can increase safety by ""benching"" (digging in tiered levels), or by digging the walls at a slope instead of vertically.

An experienced trench excavator may choose to keep the trench unsupported at depths up to 5 ft (1.5 m), but only under stable soil conditions.Follow the 3 ft (0.9 m) rule if you do not have expert supervision.

Prepare to excavate.,
Clear debris and trim weeds and grass.,
Mark your trench.,
Loosen soil with your spade on one side.,
Apply your spade to the opposite side.,
Pack trench walls, install edging, and maintain.",How to Make a Trench2," Garden trenches are smaller in nature, usually intended to border flower beds keeping overgrowth and crowding of your flowerbeds to a minimum. Even if your trench is shallow or only a spade deep, it can unearth unexpected and unwanted surprises. You should make sure the place you are digging is free of utility lines, pipes, roots, foundation, or other obstructions. Call 811 or another utility location service before you begin.


The blade of your round-point shovel will sever roots up to half an inch thick. Place the blade of your shovel atop the root and stomp on the flange of the blade to sever it. For extreme cases, you might want to consider purchasing a Pulaski digging tool.
While mechanical trenching devices will usually sever roots, they may react violently or unpredictably when they encounter a thick one. Consider removing roots by hand before using a machine.

, A thicket of weeds can put a halt to digging quick, causing tangles with your shovel that will take time to cut through. Trimming lawn or plants as low reasonably possible

, Do this as you would for any other trenching or excavation project, using highly visible marking paint to establish the layout of your trench. This will help prevent you from making mistakes and wasting unnecessary effort., Stepping on your spade to drive it through the dirt at about a 45 degree angle, insert your spade about 6 inches into the soil approximately 2 inches out from your guideline.Angle your spade, so that your trench walls are slightly angled and the bottom outside edge of your trench sits beneath your guideline., You should use the same angle you did previously to leave the outside bottom of your trench directly under your guideline and your trench walls slightly angled. Wiggle your spade back and forth to further loosen the soil, and remove what you can, switching to your clear-out shovel when convenient., Using a trowel, you can pack soil along the trench walls to prevent collapse. With shears you can trim grass to more cleanly define the boundary of your trench, or you can lay plastic edging to minimize maintenance effort on your part.


Typically during the change in the seasons, debris like leaves and intrusions like growing plant matter might leave your trench looking less than tidy. Take time in spring and summer to keep it maintained.
Plastic edging generally installs easily, either being laid in the space you've excavated or else being laid in your trench with some light fill dropped on top to keep it in place.

Evaluate your abilities.,
Consider the machine you will need.,
Decide to buy or rent the machine.,
Take safety precautions.,
Learn to properly operate the machine.,
Do not run the machine with people nearby.,
Position and prime your machine.,
Engage your machine and trench.",How to Make a Trench3," Only an experienced operator should attempt to dig a trench with a machine. These machines are very physically demanding, and can be extremely dangerous for an unskilled user.

All ordinary trench safety precautions apply as well. This includes calling 811 or another utility location service before you begin, and having plans to shore up the trench walls if necessary.

, Choosing a machine will depend on your budget and the size of the desired trench. Plotting the route of your trench with highly visible marking paint and thinking about the depth of your trench will help you determine the best trencher for your job. Most projects will only require a walk-behind trencher.


Walk-behind trenchers can dig up to 3 feet deep and between 4-6 inches wideOn average, a ride-on trencher can dig up to 7 feet deep and about 13 inches wide.
Ride-on trenchers are the largest available commercially, but due to potential safety concerns, these are usually only rented to professionals. You can contract a landscape company that installs sprinklers or a utility installation company to use this tool on your behalf.

, Most hardware stores will allow you the option of renting a machine for a few hours, a day, or even a week. Unless you have considerable trenching to do, or unless you have future projects requiring a trencher, renting might be the best option for your project.


Trenchers cost anywhere between $900 and $1 million to buy, and at least $70 to $200 to rent for a day or two, plus the cost of transport.You may also find a more affordable trencher through online services, like Craig's List or eBay.

, If you decide to operate a trencher, you might consider taking a free trench safety class. The main points you want to keep in mind are the stability of your trench, your footing, and the consistency of the soil, which will influence the effort you and your trenching machine will have to exert. Rocky soil or roots can cause stones or grit to become airborne, so it is recommended you wear safety glasses while operating your trencher.There is also considerable danger from the rotating digging chain, and from the risk of the heavy, powerful machine getting away from you.

, Each machine will be different, but most will have an ignition switch, a choke, and an engagement lever, which you will manipulate to control the trencher.Due to variations in make and model, it is safest to familiarize yourself with operation manuals before use.


If you have rented your trencher, do not leave the rental yard without a demonstration of the machine's operation, including a check that all safety and shut off switches are working properly. You should also have access to a copy of the manual, although you may be able to find this online by searching for the make and model information.

, Be sure to keep all other people and pets far away while the machine is running. During operation, if you need to clear debris from a stuck chain or trench, or leave the machine for any reason, always shut off the machine completely. Never leave the machine running while you are not operating it. Even if the chain is disengaged, the machine can cause severe injury or death., You'll want to double check that your path is clear, but now that you're aware of the basic functions of your trencher, turn on the ignition, pull out the choke, and position the digging chain where you want your trench to begin.

, Pull the engagement lever/switch (depending on model) and walk slowly backward along the trench path you have plotted. As operating this machine requires you to walk backward, be careful not to trip and hurt yourself or do damage to your trenching machine.


Large roots or stones might have to be cleared by hand. If your trencher stops for an unknown reason, turn the machine fully off, remove it from your trench, and explore with hand tools, clearing any obstructions with your shovels, Pulaski digging tool, or pruning shears.

Attach the upper beams.,
You’ll need 5 more 4x4” beams.,
Bolt the flat side of the 6’1” beams to the ends of the 8’ 7” beam so that two triangles are joined by the 8’ 7” beam running between them.,
Attach the roof beams.,
Insert your windows.,
Paint the structure.,
Add a roof covering.,
Create walls.,
Personalize your gazebo.",How to Make a Gazebo," You will need four large posts for the corners. These can be whatever height or distance between that you like, but we recommend 12' long 4x4 beams.


Mark out an even 8’x8’ square where you want the gazebo to go and then dig holes for the posts using a post hole digger.
Level the posts in the holes such that 8’ is above ground and the inside corners are 8’ apart.
Then, use quick cement to anchor them, making sure that they remain straight and of equal height. The quick cement should fill ⅔ of the hole around the post and the remainder can be covered with dirt after it sets.;
, Use 6 more 4x4 beams to brace the 3 ""closed"" sides of the gazebo. The beams will need to be placed perpendicular to the posts, 2 to each side, 2"" from the top and bottom respectively (although the distance may need to be adjusted, read full instructions). Secure the beams with two large bolts, placed through the post and into the center of each beam.


This is definitely a two or three person job. At least one person will need to hold the beam while the other attaches the bolts.
You may have to pre-drill the bolt holes.
The distance between the two beams will be dependent on whether or not you add windows, and what the dimensions of those windows are if you choose to add them. If adding windows, measure their height, add 1.5”, and make this the distance between the bracing beams.

, Salvage some old wood and glass windows (six pane or similar). Fit them at the center of each of the three walls and mark their width. Then, create a frame for the window using 1x4s. The height should be the same as the window and distance between the bracing beams (accounting for the width of the frame itself). Nail the frame into position, fit the window in, and set it in place by placing nails on either side.


The nails should stick up by a quarter of an inch. Fit them as close as possible to the window itself so that the window won’t move. Three or four for each side of the window is probably a good enough number.
You can seal it with wood glue or caulk if you want to.

, You will need four more beams to join the posts at the top. These should be roughly 8’7” long. Cut a 3.5 x 3.5 x ¾” square into the ends of each of the four beams. The cuts should be made on the same side of each beam. Use these cuts to fit the pieces together like a puzzle, the two indented ends fitting together. This is called a half-lap splice joint.

, Glue these together and then join them to the top of the posts using one or two bolts placed through the square and into the posts.

, Four at 6' 1"" length and one at 8’ 7”. Cut a 45° angle into one end of each of the 4 beams.

, Make sure that you keep the 45° angles in mind, as they will need to be able to sit flat on the top of the walls. The bolts should be at least an inch apart.

, Holding the roof in place, bolt it into the corner posts at each end. Make sure your bolts aren’t too long: you want them to go in but not pop through the other side of the post.

, You can also add windows into the triangles (smaller than the windows in the walls). This is done in exactly the same way as with the walls, but you will have to add a top frame first. Measure the height of the wooden window frame, first making sure that it fits into the triangle. Then measure and cut a piece of 4x4 beam to fit at that height and bolt it into place. Once it’s in place the window can be inserted as before.

, You can paint the entire wood structure whatever color you want to. Paint it to match your house or paint it a bold color to make it a backyard accent piece. Make sure the paint you use is appropriate for outdoor use. Paint can additionally protect the wood, prolonging the life of your structure.

, You can of course add corrugated aluminium or fiberglass roofing fit to size and secured with nails. However, for a magazine look, screw hooks 1” away from the top and bottom of each angled roof beam (on the inside area). Suspend stretch cable between these hooks and use curtains with rod pockets at the top and bottom to create beautiful designer-look roofing.

, You can similarly install curtain rods on the inside of the structure to hang curtains to create movable walls. These can be tied back to the posts when not in use.

, You can add all sorts of other extras to your gazebo. Hang flower pots between the posts and windows. Hang string lights to create a romantic effect. Fill it with a table and chairs or even a bed! You are limited only by your imagination.

The title block's first section lists the blueprint's name, number, as well as the location, site, or vendor.If the drawing is part of a series this information will also be listed. This section is largely for filing and organizational purposes.
The second section comprises bureaucratic information. Approval dates and signatures are located here. If you find a blueprint that interests you and want to know more, this information can be invaluable.
Section three of the title block is the list of references. This lists all other drawings that are related to the building/system/component, as well as all blueprints that were used as reference/inspiration. Similar to the second section this can be incredibly helpful if you are to begin your own blueprint.;
, Any time changes to a building/system/component are made, the drawing has to be redrafted. Those changes are listed here.

, In addition to the standard scale, grid, and lines, blueprints are often comprised of other symbols and numbers. In order to fully comprehend the specific blueprint you're working with, be sure to learn those symbols by reading through the legend. The notes will reveal any specifications or information the designer thinks will aid in understanding the drawing.


For projects that actually begin construction it is even more important to read the notes. It's possible practical information like, ""Do not begin working until 8am,"" will be listed.

, With 2D blueprints, there are three common perspectives: plan, elevation, and section.Understanding which one of these is being employed is an important first step to reading any drawing.


Plan: A bird's eye view of planned work. Usually this is done on a horizontal plane at 30"" above the floor. This perspective allows precise mapping of width and length.
Elevation: A view of planned work from the side. These drawings are usually oriented from the north, east, west, or south. Composing an elevation map allows for detailed planning of height dimensions.
Section: A view of something as if it were cut through. This perspective is generally imaginary, and is used to show the inner workings of how something will be built.

, Blueprints are scaled down representations of things like houses, underground piping, and power line. To ensure proper construction, always use precise measurements. The scale sets a rule for the entire drawing, saying what measurements on the drawing are equal to in real life. For example 1/8"" = 1' (one eighth inch equals one foot).


Architectural scales are used for the construction of building exterior and interiors; for establishing doors, windows, and walls. Many are presented in fractions: 1/4"" = 1' (one-fourth inch equals one foot), 1/8"" = 1' (one-eighth inch equals 1 foot). Engineer scales, or civil scales, are used for public water systems, roads and highways, as well as topographical endeavors. They use whole-integer ratios like 1"" = 10' (one inch equals 10 feet) or 1"" = 50' (one inch equals fifty feet)., Along the horizontal and vertical edges of a blueprint, drawers often fix a simple grid system with numbers on one axis and letters on the other.This allows anyone reading the plans to reference the location of a point or object within the drawing. For example, ""let's take a look at the doorframe centered at point C7.""


If you are looking over the drawings with a team or partner and can't physically point to the location you're discussing, grid systems are very useful. This could be the case if you working online from different locations, or the other person/people simply isn't in the room with you.

, On blueprints, doors look like larger gaps between walls. There will also be a curved line with a mock door extended in or out of the door frame. This reveals which way the door will swing upon construction. Windows are likewise identified by the end of object lines and will typically be represented realistically to show their size., Fridges, toilets, sinks, ovens, stove-tops burners, and the like will be represented by simplistic representations that are readily recognizable. Take the time to consider whether they are located in an area where you want them. Although it may seem like their placement comes second the establishing walls, they can end up playing a more important role in deciding on design specifications.

, Although it can seem overwhelming when taken in all at once, lines are the language of blueprints. Lines often represent walls, door frames, and appliance exteriors; however they have many other purposes and are the primary characteristic of planned drawings. Depending on their thickness, whether they are straight or curved, dashed or consistent, lines have different schematic significance. The type of basic lines are as follows:


Object Line
Hidden Line
Center Line
Extension and Dimension Line
Cutting Plane Lines
Section Line
Break Lines
Phantom Line

, Object lines - or visible lines - are drawn the thickest of all on a blueprint. They represent what sides of an object are visible to the eye. Consider a simple drawn cube, the only lines seen are those visible.On a blueprint, these take on an added importance; thicker than all others, they became the reference point to compare the weight and composition of all other lines.

, Hidden lines - or invisible lines - reveal surfaces that otherwise would not be visible to the eye. They are drawn at half the weight of object lines, with short, consistently spaced dashes.Consider the same drawing of a cube and how sometimes the otherwise invisible lines are represented in this same way.


One rule of hidden lines is that they must always begin in contact with the line that is their starting point. The exception to this is anytime that first dash would appear to be a continuation of a solid line.

, Dimension lines show you the distance between any two locations in a drawing. Whether that be walls in a house, or the space between wiring in an electrical outlet. They are drawn as short, solid lines, with arrowheads on each end. The line's center point is broken, and here you will see the dimension (i.e. 3.5, 1.8, etc.)


Dimension lines will help to envision a more 3D space and maintain correct spacing within a room or object.

, Center lines establish the central axis of an object or part.You will most often see these with plans for circular or curved objects. On blueprints, they are drawn with alternating long and short dashes. Long dashes are on each end, and short dashes at points of intersection.


Center lines are drawn with the same weight as invisible lines.

, Phantom lines are used to illustrate different positions of an object. For example think of a switch in the off position. Phantom lines could be used to represent its possible appearance in the on position. On blueprints you will see them drawn with one long and two short dashes, with another long dash on the end - all evenly spaced.


Phantom lines also show any detail that needs to be repeated, or even the location of absent parts.

, Extension lines are used to precisely define the physical limit of any dimension. They are drawn as short, solid lines, and can be placed inside or outside of the dimension being defined. Extending from the object outline, they do not actually touch the object lines.


Since dimension lines often have to hover above an object simply because there is no room on the paper, or they would overlap, extension lines allow for more definite end and beginning points.
Dimension lines are drawn with the same weight as invisible lines.

, Leaders lines are solid lines ending typically in an arrowhead; these indicate any part or area of a drawing that is associated with a number, letter, note, or other reference.


Desks, bookcases, and other furniture that don't come pre-assembled are a common reference to remember leader lines. In the instruction manual, lead lines are frequently used to define parts (i.e. ""Place slot A into hole B"").

, Break lines are used any time a part is removed in order to reveal what lies immediately beneath. In architectural drawings they are often used when a long section of drawing have the same structure; this reduces the drawing size and saves paper.Short break lines are done freehand and resemble a solid, thick sin wave.
Long break lines are long, thin ruler-produced lines interspersed with freehand zig-zags.

, There are a number of general and trade-specific books on reading blueprints, some of which are published by hardware and tool-manufacturing companies and others by government agencies, such as the United States Army. These books are available in hard-copy and e-book formats.


If you're interested primarily in architectural drawings, be sure to specify that in your searches.
It's also possible to find blueprint lessons for maritime, civil, and engineering work in addition to many other fields.

, Videos are available in DVD format and as streaming Internet video.


Many of the video tutorials available on popular viral streaming sites are uploaded by people with practical experience in construction and architecture. However some are presented by amateurs. Be sure to use discretion in self-learning online. Compare what you've learned to more formal academic sources that are also online.
Youtube learning is a good place to start in your self-education because they can provide a more basic and grounding understanding, before you move into denser, more complex academic sources.

, Blueprinting-reading classes are available at local trade schools and community colleges, as well as online.


Universities teach many of the classes available online, but you can also learn from less expensive, specialized companies that only teach blueprint reading. Consider your budget when deciding which is right for you.
Although learning online is convenient, you will definitely benefit from going to a community college, trade school, or University class. With an experienced teacher you can ask questions, bring in your work for review and receive consultation.

, In addition to providing access to classes and instructional videos, the Internet also offers a number of Web sites with information on reading blueprints. Although you won't receive any formal certification, all the resources you need to learn complex blueprint reading is available online.


Read papers published by universities and experienced specialists so you can understand the language of architecture, and to make sure you're getting correct information.
Balance this by reading and watching the materials produced by people who've experimented and self-taught. Be aware that they could potentially be presenting incorrect information, but also learn from their mistakes and experiences.

To make your very own burn barrel, you first need a barrel.,
One end of the barrel, which will become the top, must be open.,
Once the top is open, turn the barrel upside down.,
Using a piece of 'expanded metal', heavy screen, or something similar, make a cover to be placed over the barrel.,
Some barrel makers like to add a few larger holes around the bottom to act as vents, supplying oxygen to the fire.,
Place your 'burnables' in the barrel, use a long lighter or fireplace match to light, place the cover over the top, and let it burn.

",How to Make a Burn Barrel," A 55 gallon (208.2 L) metal drum works best. These can often be had for free, or very cheaply, from manufacturing facilities, junkyards, etc.;
, If your barrel has a cover, remove the cover. If the barrel is a 'tight' drum (both ends are sealed), you will need to open one end. A reciprocating saw works best, but a jigsaw with a metal cutting blade will do. Wear hearing protection, this will be loud!

, With a hammer and large punch, drill, or something similar, make holes in the bottom of the barrel. You may wish to make a few holes in the sides of the barrel, in the bottom third of it. Not too many, or your barrel will be weak.

, This will keep sparks and cinders to a minimum.

, These are not necessary, but can provide a more complete burn.

Check with your Home Owner's Association or city ordinances., Most loads of clothes use 35 feet of line. The length of line needs to accommodate at least one load. The area you place the clothesline in shouldn't be a high traffic area. Make sure it's not in an area where people or dogs frequently walk. You also don't want the clothesline to hang over anything, like flowers, a pool, or shrubbery.


Don't make the line any longer than that. The longer the line, the more sag the line will have.Avoid placing your clothesline under trees that drip sap, leaves, or other material. You also want to avoid placing your clothesline under trees with a lot of birds.If you want to dry colored clothes, make sure there is a spot in the shade so the colors don't fade.
You can spread clotheslines between multiple posts or multiple trees if you plan on drying many loads at one time.

, When building your clothesline, you want to make sure that it is the proper height. You don't want the clothesline to be too tall so that you can't easily hang your clothes. On the other hand, you don't want the line to be too low so that larger items, such as blankets and sheets, touch the ground.


The wood for your posts need to be taller than how high you want the poles. Part of the pole will be in ground. For a 6 ft. clothesline, you will need at least wood that is 8 ft. tall.

, To make a proper clothesline, you need to purchase the right materials. You will need:

2- 4 x 4 x 10′ treated wood posts
2- 2 x 2 x 8′ treated wood posts
8 - 1/4″ x 6″ hot dip galvanized lag screws (and washers)
2 - 1/4” x 8” galvanized lag bolts
8 – eye hooks
2 – clothesline tighteners
2 – quick links
100 ft clothesline
2 bags Quikrete, To make a clothesline, you will have to saw wood, drill holes for bolts, and dig a hole into the ground. To accomplish this, you need the following tools:

Miter saw
Drill and bits
Clamps
Post level
Post hole diggers
Bucket (optional), Most clotheslines are approximately 6 ft. tall. Two 10 ft. posts work well for this, because it gives you the height and allows 3-4 ft. of the post to be buried underground. You can also use a 8-8 1/2 ft. post instead. If the posts are too long, you need to cut them. However, these two posts may not need to be cut at all.If you live in a climate that experiences a deep freeze in the winter, make sure to put your posts below the freeze line so they don't shift. Decide if that is 3 or 4 ft. or more.You may also need to bury the post deeper in the ground if you live in an area with sandy or unstable soil.

, Take the two 8 ft. posts and cut them in half. This will give you four 4 ft. posts. Then take two of the 4 ft. beams and cut them in half so you have four 2 ft. beams. These will be used for the cross braces.That should give you one 4 ft. crossbeam and two 2 ft. braces for each clothesline post.
Cut 45 degree angles into the ends of the 2 ft. beams. To do this, adjust your miter saw to the 45 angle.These beams will be the braces. Make sure you double check your angles before cutting the wood. Messing up the angle means you will have to get another piece of wood.
The crosspiece can be around 3 ft. long if you want. You can also cut the ends of the crosspiece at an angle if you don't want flat edges.

, Measure and mark the center of the crossbeam and the center of the top of the post. The center mark will be on the edge of the crossbeam at the top that faces the sky. The center mark on the post will be on the top, which is the edge that the brace sits on. Drill a hole that is a little narrower than the lag bolt in the center where you made your mark.

Connect the crossbeam to the post with the lag bolt.When complete, the crossbeam will sit on top of the post, in the shape of a T.

, Fit the braces against the post and crossbeam. You want to drill the holes near the bottom at an angle so it will connect to the post, and then through the top so it will connect to the crossbeam and brace. Drill holes into these areas, making sure the hole is centered on the wood.

The braces will fit snugly against the beam and post because of the angle you cut into each end.
Clamp the wooden braces in place to stabilize them.Drill the holes into the beams and screw in the bolts.

, Measure the spaces for your eye hooks evenly along the crossbeam. Make sure not to start at the very edge. Try starting around 6 inches from the edge. For 4 hooks, you want to space them 10-12 inches apart. Pre-drill the holes, and then twist the eye hooks into the holes.You can use the handle of your screwdriver to twist the hooks into the wood.
You may want to install 3 eye hooks instead of 4 depending on the length of your crossbeam., Use post hole diggers to dig the holes where you marked them earlier. The holes need to be about 1-2 ft. deep if you live in a warmer climate, and 3-4 ft. deep if you live in an area that is prone to deep freezes or a sandy area.The holes need to be 12 in. wide.Before you dig any holes in your yard, double check to make sure there are no gas, water, cable, or telephone lines in the area where you are digging.

, Drop the clothesline posts into the holes. Place a post level onto the post. Make sure to get the posts level before pouring any concrete. Get someone to help you, or try adding dirt and packing it into the hole to help hold it while you adjust., Pour 1 bag of dry concrete mix into each hole. Add water from the garden hose. Mix the concrete with a mixing stick to combine the concrete until it is a uniform consistency. Use the level again to make sure the posts are level before the concrete has a chance to set. Let the concrete set for 24-72 hours.You may want to pour the bag out in stages. This may make it easier to mix and keep the post level.
As you add the concrete, continue to tamp it down with each new section of concrete so that everything is as compact as possible.You can also mix the concrete in buckets before you pour it into the holes.
Use rope or heavy string to keep the post straight while the concrete dries.

, Once the concrete has completely dried, shovel the dirt back on top to cover the concrete. Pack the dirt down to make sure the hole is secure., Connect two clothesline tighteners to outside eye hooks on one post. You can buy these at home improvement stores. The tighteners allow you to make sure that your line is taut without sag, and also allows you to tighten the line if it starts to sag over the years from weather and use., Buy a 100 ft. cloth clothesline from a home improvement store. Cut the clothesline in half. Tie one end of the rope to the inside eye hook beside the tightener.

If your posts are too far apart, you might have to buy two packs 100 ft. cloth clothesline and string one through each side. Cut off the excess when you're finished.
If you want to prevent frayed ends, tape the ends of the rope or burn them with a cigarette lighter., Pull the rope to the opposite post, and loop it through the matching inside eye hook. Pull it across and through the outside eye hook. Stretch the rope back across to the original post, where it should meet up with the tightener.


Pull the rope through the tightener. Tighten the rope. Trim any excess rope.Each rope should go through 4 eye hooks in all: one on the inside and one on the outside on each post.

, Another option is to attach pulleys to the eye hooks instead of tying the rope directly to the hooks and looping around. Pulleys can be purchased at home improvement stores. Attach them to all eye hooks.

Wrap the clothesline around both pulleys on either post. Tie one end of the rope to the hook on the end of a tightener, and pull the other end of the rope through the tightener. You will have a movable, tight loop of rope threaded through each pulley.Make sure to knot both ends securely, and cut off any excess rope.

Analyze the composition of your local soil and secure a soil sample from a laboratory.,
Add soil that is comparable in composition when leveling the soil.

",How to Level Dirt1,"


Dirt is a natural resource composed of decomposed rock that has been changed over time by environmental influences.
It may contain soils blown onto it from a distance by the winds, chemicals brought to your area by waters that have disappeared long ago, and organic material from plant, animal, and insect life.
Dirt generally includes water, oxygen, silicate, aluminum, and iron, but these elements occur in different proportions that influence the soil's color and texture.;

Pull weeds and measure the length and width of the beach area.,
Purchase sand and gravel.,
Add a plastic liner to deter plant growth.,
Spread the gravel on the liner.,
Finish your backyard beach with a layer of sand.",How to Make a Beach1," Get your garden tools and remove all plants from the area you’ll be putting in your beach. Once the area is clear, use your tape measure to determine its length and width.

It may be easiest to use a shovel to remove the top layer of plants or till the greenery under the surface of the soil.If you plan on hanging a traditional hammock, this is the perfect time to dig some postholes and sink a sturdy wooden 4x4 board.;
, Gravel will form the base of your beach area and can be shaped to add a dune-like contour. The amount you’ll need will depend on the amount of contour you desire. Where sand’s concerned, you’ll need enough to cover the entire area at least 6 in (15.2 cm) deep.


Beach or mortar sand work best and are widely available. Decomposed granite can also work as your base and is easy to mold into dunes.
If you’re unsure how much sand you’ll need, input the length, width, and depth of your planned beach area into an online sand calculator. This number is usually in cubic yards or meters., If you don’t put down a liner, over time plants will invade your beach area, even if you were really careful when weeding. You can pull these up as they push through the sand, but a plastic liner will make plant invasions all but nonexistent., If you want a level beach area, rake an even layer of gravel onto the plastic liner. Heap up small hills so that when it’s covered with sand it looks like sand dunes. When you’ve got the contour just right, spray it liberally with water and let it sit overnight.

Hosing down the gravel base will harden it, making it more stable. To prevent too much sand from falling into gaps in the gravel, use a little potting soil to fill gaps and holes after the gravel dries., Spread sand evenly over the entire area, though you may want to add some extra to high traffic areas or play areas. This will prevent the gravel from being exposed and make your backyard beach more realistic.

If you haven’t plugged holes with potting soil, at first it may seem like sand is simply disappearing into the gravel. Keep layering it on until the sand is at least 6 in (15.2 cm) deep.
Keep a rake set off to the side of your beach area so you can redistribute sand when necessary and keep a healthy layer over top the gravel beneath.

Alternatively, buy sod.",How to Level Ground," This area does not need to be perfectly square or rectangular unless you are planning on using sod instead of simply replanting your grass. Drive wooden or plastic stakes around the area to be leveled.;
, Attach strings to stretch between the stakes, a few inches above the ground. Attach a string level to the strings to determine the high point. This will usually be your starting point and the rest of the ground will be brought to here, but you can also lower some ground if that makes more sense for your project.








, Using a tape measure and your level, adjust the strings until you can see how much height needs to be added or taken away across the area you are adjusting.








, Keep in mind that you may want to adjust the grade of your land to help combat drainage problems. Your land should be graded 1"" for every 4', leading away from your home.

, If you are leveling a small area and it is mostly level, you probably will not need to remove the grass. However, if you have a large area and a lot of leveling to do, removing the grass will be much easier. A simple shovel is all that's necessary for a reasonable amount of space.








, Depending on how much ground you have to cover and what will be going on the ground afterwards, you'll need to level your land with differing mixtures of soil, sand, and compost/manure fertilizer. If you want to grow grass in this area, the cover will need to be nutrient rich. If you are simply wanting to place a small shed or pool, soil and sand will do just fine.








, Use a garden rake to spread the material evenly, checking using your level and a measuring tape to make sure it's staying level. If you have a large area to cover, there are small versions of ground moving equipment that you can rent from your local hardware store. They will be able to advise you on what will work best for your property.








, If you are leveling a small area, you can tamp the soil using your foot and the bottom of your rake. If you are leveling a large area, or it is especially important to keep the ground level (such as if you are building a structure), get a tamper or plate compactor to compact the soil., Give the soil plenty of time to settle. It needs at least 48 hours, if not several days or weeks to settle properly. Mist the area with water if your area does not get rainfall during that time.

, If you are intending to reintroduce grass to that area, you will need to buy grass seed that is appropriate for your needs and the area in which you live. Get your seed, as well as a hand spreader or other tool to spread the seed evenly.








, Lightly cover the seeds with a sprinkling of topsoil and lightly tamp it down.








, Mist the area with water 4 times a day for at least 2 days to encourage the seeds to germinate.








, Give the grass time to grow in and then reseed areas where the grass does not grow in to your satisfaction.

, You can also buy sod if you are impatient or want a particularly uniform appearance.

Check for laws and permission.,
Select the location.,
Mark the location.,
Prepare the site for the boulder.,
Move the boulder or boulders into place.,
Landscape the boulders to further integrate them into the environment.",How to Lay Boulders in Landscape,"


Select a boulder from either on your property or somewhere close. The weight and logistics of moving large boulders will make long distance moves very expensive.
Chose the kind and color of rocks naturally found in your area to make the boulder look more natural in the environment.
Make sure the boulder is proportional to where it will be placed. Small yards shouldn’t have huge boulders laid in them and large expanses of property look silly with small rocks placed in the center of them.
Chose more than one boulder in odd quantities, (i.e. 3, 5, 7, etc.) and lay them in groups for the most natural look.;
,


Check with the local government and any homeowners association you belong to and find out if there are any laws or rules that would restrict where you could place a boulder.
Get permission for the boulder placement from a landlord if you have one.
Make sure the location you are considering is on your property, and that it is not in an easement or shared access route.

,


Make sure that there is a clear route to move the boulder into the location, taking into account the type of equipment that will be needed to move the boulder, if it will have room to maneuver or if it would damage driveways or a septic field.
Locate any underground lines, pipes, septic tanks or fields; large boulders should not be placed over them.
Check to determine whether the desired placement will restrict access to public utility lines or access by emergency personnel.
Think about future plans for the property and if the boulder placement would restrict them. This is important if large boulders will be near buildings or pools.

, Use stakes, chalk lines, hose or rope to mark off the location, size and shape of the boulder or group of boulders.

,


Remove any sod or vegetation from your marked area.
Remove approximately 2” of soil from the marked area where the boulder will rest and look nestled into the environment. This also keeps the stone from moving out of place.

, Make sure to have the correct and safest type of equipment to move a boulder.


Roll smaller boulders into place with a few friends’ help.
Use a roller bar system or a winch on a truck to move larger boulders.
Hire or rent large earth moving or special rock moving equipment for the largest boulders.

,


Think about how plants would grow around your group of boulders in a natural setting. You want the boulders to seem nested in their environment.
Good landscape choices for planting near boulders are low maintenance perennials and specimen plants that draw the eye to the group.
Keep the planting in scale to the boulders. Huge boulders need small trees and shrubs, not low growing ground covers. Smaller rocks look best with plants that don’t overwhelm them.

You might ask about regulations saying something like, “Hi, I’m planning on adding a manmade beach to a pond on my property. Are there any laws or regulations I should be aware of moving forward?”
You should inspect the area where you’ll build your beach thoroughly. Accidentally harming endangered plants or animals may still carry a stiff penalty., If you only layer sand on the shoreline of your body of water, plants will eventually spring up and reclaim the area. Similar to a backyard beach, you can use a plastic liner to prevent plant growth beneath your sand.As an alternative to the plastic liner, you can use regular applications of an herbicide to keep your beach looking sandy and pristine.
Some regions have laws against using a liner (or other kinds of plant barriers) underneath a fresh layer of top-sand., Generally, you’ll want the largest grain beach or mortar sand you can get. Outdoors, sand is more likely to be blown around your property or washed to the bottom of the body of water. Large-grained sand will be less likely to migrate away from your planned beach area.

For most outdoor beaches, you should plan to cover it in at least 6 in (15.2 cm) of sand, but do not exceed more than 18 in (45.7 cm).There are products you can buy, like sand mats, that prevent weeds from growing and sand from being washed or blown away.

, This may be a time consuming process if your beach area is large. A shovel, rake, and some elbow grease will eventually get the job done, but a rototiller, backhoe, or front loader will make weed removal a cinch.

Rototillers, backhoes, and front loaders can be very expensive. Save some money by renting one of these when you need it from your local hardware store or home centers.

, Moisture and gasses in the soil and air can cause your sand to be absorbed into surrounding soil, especially clay. A shade cloth with prevent this from happening. Purchase shade cloths at hardware stores and home centers., Unless you have some kind of wall or barrier where your sand transitions to the natural bottom of the body of water, your sand will quickly be washed away. A concrete curb, landscape timber barrier, or cross tie boundary all work well for retaining sand.

Be sure you clearly mark the retaining feature with buoys, flags, or similar things to prevent swimmers from stubbing toes or otherwise harming themselves., Now that all the prep work has been done, all you need to do spread out the sand. After that, rake the sand regularly with a sand rake (like the kinds used on golf courses) to prevent plant seeds from growing.

If your sand becomes flat and hard, use a rototiller, hoe, or pickaxe to break it up a couple of times every year."

Use surfboards, towels, and similar items to convey a tropical theme.,
Grow beach plants.,
Create a fire pit.,
Improve the ambiance of your beach area with lighting.,
Make a sandbox on top of the beach with an inflatable pool.,
Play sounds of the beach with a playlist or music station.,
Add finishing touches with beach themed items.",How to Make a Beach3," You can also hang Hawaiian leis (flower necklaces) from chairs, surfboards, bannisters, and fence posts to get a tropical feel.


To recreate a tropical beach setting, decorate with bright colors.
Drape colorful beach towels from chairs or lay them out on the sand for sunbathing.
Items made from wood, bamboo, and linen will add to the beachside vibe. Try to keep your theme cohesive and consistent.

, By growing plants common to beach areas on your beach, it will be even more realistic. You may be able to insert some plants right in the sand, but others might do best in a pot. Some plants to consider for your beach:

Arthropodium cirratum (rengarenga lily)
Astelia chathamica (Silver Spear)
Austroderia (Toetoe)
Carex virgata
Frangipanis
Yucca faxoniana (Spanish dagger), As the sun sets and the temperature drops, many beach parties often turn into beach bonfires. Collect some rocks (or flagstones) and arrange these in a circle to create a fire pit.

Depending on where you've built your beach, it may be easier and safer to set out a standalone metal fire pit or brazier.In most areas, making a fire out in the open requires a burning permit. This should be available through your local government offices, like the clerk or fire department.

, Natural light should do most of the work for you during the day. But direct sunlight can be brutal. Offer some relief by setting up a canopy or sun umbrella.


When darkness descends, light up your beach area with candles, lanterns, and Tiki torches. Use string lights to add a magical, fairy-light feel., An inflatable pool will keep sand from spreading out in a thin layer, making this a perfect place to build sandcastles. If kids are around, they'll love it! Include a small bucket, plastic shovel, and other sandcastle making tools.


If you’re not a fan of playing in the sand, why not fill the pool with a small amount of water to cool off your feet when the weather’s hot?
Not a sandbox or pool fan? Use a decorative fountain instead. The sound of flowing water will have a calming effect., You should be able to find beach-themed tracks on YouTube or a music platform, like Spotify or Pandora. Many white noise makers have an “ocean sounds” track that you can use to evoke the sense of a nearby body of water even when your eyes are closed.

Calypso and reggae are styles of music often associated with tropical climates.Hook up some speakers and play this music to accompany your beach scene.

, Scatter shells on tables and use woven wicker mats for placemats. If you have a small piece of driftwood, you might use it as a table centerpiece. Larger pieces can be arranged around plants and rocks to make the scene appear freshly washed ashore.


Beach toys scattered about, like beach balls, floaties, and surfboards, will give the impression of a fun beachside scene."

Research various options for landscaping with rocks.,
Determine a budget for your project.,
Design a layout of the property from a bird's eye view.,
Check your local rock supplier to see what is available for rocks and boulders for landscaping.,
Prepare the location of the rocks by clearing it of weeds and debris.,
Add professional landscape cover over the prepared grounds.",How to Landscape With Rocks," Look online and in landscaping magazine for landscaping ideas. These resources will give you an idea of what type of rocks you can work with and how you can utilize them. You may not be able to get certain rocks if they are regional, but you may be able to substitute. The idea at this point is to get design ideas.;
, By establishing a certain amount, you will know what the realistic options are when you are shopping. Without a budget, you are at risk of spending more than you anticipated when purchasing the rocks for landscaping alone.

, Make sure everything is to scale. Add the boulders and rocks where you plan on positioning them and make sure that you are satisfied. When placing the rocks, try to maintain a natural look and feel. This will be your opportunity to rearrange your design if you find flaws.

, You may have to order some of the supplies, so give yourself enough time to put your design into place. Before making a final purchase, inquire about how the rocks will be delivered. Determine whether the options are feasible for the property you will be landscaping or whether the vehicles and machines transporting your rocks will have difficulty accessing the grounds.

, Take note of the fact that the earth will settle under the boulders, rocks and stones; therefore, you may need to add earth to certain areas to compensate. Rake the area and press the earth down.

, You can organize the areas around the rocky sections in the same manner if you want to add plants and ground cover. Make sure everything is in place and ready for delivery. This will make the process easier to manage when the landscaping rocks arrive.

Inspect your home regularly.",How to Test for Mold," Mold often has a fuzzy appearance but can also look like a stain if it’s growing on a wall or furniture. Its most common colors are black green, brown, or white. Mold can feel like cotton, leather, velvet, or sand paper. It usually gives off a musty or earthy odor., This should be the first place you look. Its underground location makes it especially vulnerable to moisture and humidity buildup. After each heavy rain, look for and immediately treat any water seepage.Check the following spots:

Baseboards
Walls, especially where they meet the ceiling
Behind and under appliances, especially the washer and dryer

, Look in and around the clothes dryer duct for mold growth. If it’s not properly ventilated, it can trigger a build-up in humidity in the room. Make sure the duct is vented toward the exterior of the house., Darkness and moisture create ideal conditions for the spread of mold.You should check:


Under sinks, especially if they sit on top of cabinets
Closets, especially if they don’t receive proper ventilation., If your house isn’t properly insulated, windows could accumulate condensation year-round. Look for mold growth around each individual pane and along the frames., Inspect the baseboards in the basement and first/ground floor if your house recently flooded. Tear out all carpeting in these areas. If you recently experienced heavy rain, look for water stains in the attic and on the upper-story living areas.If a pipe recently burst, treat all water-damaged areas as if they had been flooded.

, Dirt and grime that washes off your body has a tendency to mix with shampoo and soap residue. This mixture ultimately collects on shower curtains. Make sure the bathroom is well lit. Spread out the shower curtain to check the entire surface. Use a magnifying glass to check for small patches of mold that you could otherwise miss.

, The corners where your walls meet the ceiling are prime locations for mold growth because they trap water from roof leaks. Check for growth and accumulation in all four corners of each room. If your wallpaper is peeling at the ceiling juncture, check behind it for mold growth., Fluctuations between heating and air conditioning cause moisture buildup on cooling coils and in drain pans. Remove the vent plate from the duct and inspect it closely. Turn on the lights or use a strong LED flashlight to easily catch mold clusters. Check the duct for as far as your eye can see.

, In-home testing kits come equipped with their own instruments and instructions. Follow the kit's directions. Submit the sampling to a local lab.


If you see mold in a visual inspection, a testing kit isn’t necessary.These kits can be difficult to use, and their results can be unreliable. Use them only as a last resort if other options aren’t available.

, A borescope can be helpful for inspecting spaces between walls.Drill a small hole into a wall recently affected by water or moisture. Slowly insert the fiber optic cable end through the hole. Check the monitor for signs of mold. Continue to move slowly as you probe deeper into the area.

Borescopes distort the size and color of mold on the monitor. If you find areas of discoloration inside the wall, contact a professional for a second opinion.
You can also use a borescope to inspect air ducts, but there are drawbacks. The instrument only lets you see so far into a duct. If the duct makes a sudden 90-degree turn, you won’t be able to see beyond that turn.

, They have instruments for mold detection that aren’t available to the general public. Get estimates from several inspectors to make sure you get a fair deal. Contact former customers for reviews and possible complaints. Consult your state's contractor licensing board to ensure your potential inspector is licensed. Make sure the inspector works with a lab accredited by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA)., Cover your mouth and nose with an N-95 respirator to avoid breathing in spores. Wear elbow-length rubber or latex gloves to protect your hands from mold and cleaning materials. Cover your eyes with goggles to protect them from airborne spores., Mix equal parts water and detergent or bleach. Dip a scrub brush into the mixture and remove the mold. Dry the area completely when you’re finished., If you noticed any leaking pipes or water seepage in your inspection, deal with it immediately. Call a professional plumber to repair leaking or sweating pipes. Fill in any spaces between pipes and walls with caulk or Icynene insulation., Use caulk to seal cracks around your windows, doors, and at critical junctures where the walls meet the floor and the ceiling. Apply caulk or weather stripping to your windows, especially between the frames and panes. Dry the area completely.Don’t caulk or paint any surfaces until the mold is completely removed.
If you’re not comfortable doing these repairs, hire a professional.

, Unless you’re trained to remove mold from air ducts, call a professional. This is especially crucial if you notice mold growth in more than one room or if your mold problem keeps recurring despite your best efforts. Search online for local professionals or ask your local health department for a recommendation., If you notice mold on carpeting, ceiling tiles, and other porous surfaces, remove and discard them. The mold makes them unfit for recycling. Ask your local waste management whether they consider it hazardous waste., If you find mold growing on books, heirlooms, or sentimental objects, consult a professional for help. Ask a senior librarian or museum conservator to refer you to a trusted expert. You could also do online searches for professionals who repair and preserve rare objects. Make sure you get the expert’s references. If possible, hire someone who is accredited by a professional organization like the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) or the American Library Association (ALA)., Keep the humidity level in your home between 30 and 50 percent. Open the windows on days when it’s not humid. This will allow fresh air to circulate and inhibit mold growth. If you live in a humid climate, run a dehumidifier in the rooms most prone to moisture., These areas are already prone to humidity. Carpets can trap moisture under their surface, even without flooding or water seepage. If your basement or bathroom isn’t carpeted, leave the floors bare. Use removable, washable mats to avoid slip hazards., This is a great investment if you live in a flood-prone area. Water that seeps into the basement collects in a sump basin and is pumped outside. Unless you are a licensed home improvement contractor, call a professional to install one. Choose a sump pump with the following specs:

Cast iron core
Alarm that sounds when the water level gets too high
Mechanical switch
Submersible pump
No-screen intake design
Impellor that can deal with objects of 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) in diameter., When you cook, turn on the exhaust fan over the stove to catch water vapor. Use the fan in the bathroom as you shower to reduce condensation cause by steam. Even if you take cooler showers, run the exhaust fan for good measure. Let the fans in each room run until all steam has been eliminated., Install them in the basement and in closets. Clean each dehumidifier regularly. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions closely for best results., Use a clean dry towel or a squeegee to remove any leftover water droplets. Make sure the curtain is completely dry. Do this after the last shower of the day to prevent moisture buildup., Water can pond around the foundation of your house and push moisture into the interior. Landscape the area around the foundation to slope downward and away from the foundation. Add extensions to downspouts to direct rainwater at least 5 feet (1.5 m) away from the foundation., Apply spray-on Icynene foam to the ceiling of your attic. The foam forms a water-tight seal as it dries. Avoid fiberglass and hard foam insulation. They can separate from their surfaces and allow moisture to seep in. Wet spray-applied cellulose insulation is also prone to mold., Check all problem areas or potential problem areas for mold (re)growth. Monitor all sealed leaks and cracks after heavy rains or floods. Otherwise, recheck your home thoroughly every six months."
"
Ventilate the area.,
Wear a respirator.,
Make your solution.,
Spray and scrub.,
Repeat and evaluate.,
Use another cleaner if the problem returns.",How to Remove Mold from Caulk1," Keep in mind that ammonia can have harmful effects when inhaled. Improve the air circulation. Open windows and doors, switch on exhaust fans, and/or set up other fans to get the air moving., Chances are that in areas like bathrooms, your options for improving airflow are pretty limited. In this case, be sure to wear a respirator that will filter out the fumes. Or just wear one anyway to be extra-safe., First, improve the ventilation in the area you’re mixing this if you’re doing so somewhere other than the area that needs cleaning. Then mix equal parts ammonia and water either directly in a spray bottle or another container before pouring the mix into your bottle with a funnel., Once your solution is mixed, squirt an even amount over the moldy caulk. Wait five to ten minutes for it to settle in and start killing the mold. Then scrub the sprayed caulk with a small brush. Wipe the caulk down with a cloth or paper towels to remove all traces when finished.

, If the first application didn’t kill or remove all the mold, try again. If repeated tries don’t seem to be doing anything, use another cleaner. Keep in mind that ammonia can be an effective mold killer with non-porous surfaces, but often has difficulty with porous ones like caulk., Be aware that caulk may look clean after you’ve scrubbed and wiped it down, but mold may still be present. If it reappears soon after your attempt with ammonia, treat this as a sign that the mold’s roots are too deep in the caulk for the ammonia to reach it effectively. Move on to another solution."
"
Expect the same risks and limitations.,
Make your solution.,
Scrub light mold with a soaked sponge.,
Spray more pronounced problems before scrubbing.,
Repeat with a cleaning brush.,
Treat deeply rooted problems with cotton coils.,
Spray the caulk again once cleaned.",How to Remove Mold from Caulk2," Ventilate the area as you would when using ammonia. Also be aware that chlorinated bleach has the same difficulty with porous surfaces. Consider bleach as an alternative only if you don’t have any ammonia on hand (or if you would just rather use bleach for whatever reason). If you’ve already tried ammonia, skip the bleach, since it probably won’t do any better of a job.Additionally, keep in mind that bleach and ammonia create toxic fumes when mixed. So if you’ve already sprayed the caulk with ammonia, don’t follow it up with bleach.

, Measure 1 cup (237 ml) of chlorinated bleach. Pour it into 1 gallon (3.75 L) of water. Stir until it’s evenly mixed.

, If your mold problem is pretty light, grab a fresh sponge. Soak it in your solution and squeeze out the excess. Then simply scrub the moldy caulk with that., If a quick scrub with a soaked sponge doesn’t do the job by itself, fill a spray bottle with your solution. Mist the moldy caulk and give it five or ten minutes to settle into the caulk. Then wipe it down again with your sponge.

, If the sponge still isn’t cutting it, spray the caulk again. Give the bleach time to reach the mold’s roots. Then scrub again, only this time use a bristled cleaning brush., If spraying the caulk doesn’t seem to be enough for the bleach to reach the mold’s roots, switch to cotton coils. Soak these in your solution. Place them along your caulk line and nudge them into it with a Q-tip. Leave them overnight so the caulk can soak up as much bleach as possible. Then scrub it down again in the morning., Remove mold and other dirt by wiping down the caulk with a cloth or paper towels. Then spray the area again with your solution and let it be. Prevent new mold from growing by keeping this active agent in place."
"
Use 3% hydrogen peroxide.,
Go with vinegar.,
Use baking soda with water.,
Try a borax-and-water solution.",How to Remove Mold from Caulk3," First, check the ingredients to make sure it has a concentration of 3%. Then simply fill a spray bottle with the stuff and spray the caulk until it’s thoroughly soaked. Give the cleaner ten minutes to settle in, and then scrub the caulk with a sponge, brush, or both. Wipe the area clean when finished., Use white distilled vinegar, not any other fancier varieties that you might have in the pantry. Fill a spray bottle and then soak the moldy caulk with it. Let it soak for one hour, then wipe the mold away with a sponge and rinse with water., Measure a ¼ tablespoon of baking soda. Dump this in a spray bottle. Fill the bottle with water and shake it up. Spray the affected area once and then wipe it clean immediately with a sponge or brush. Then rinse the caulk line with water and spray again to stop mold from growing back., Add 1 cup (204 g) of borax to 1 gallon (3.75 L) of water. Either soak a sponge in the solution and soak the mold with that, or fill a spray bottle and mist the caulk. Then scrub it down with a brush and wipe it clean."

Consider your options:


Hardscapes, however beautiful, will kill your budget.,
Ask friends for 'starts' of hostas, irises, and all kinds of perennials.,
Plant en-masse.,
Buy perennials.,
Invest in big pots.,
Add boulders to your space.,
Buy trees first.",How to Landscape Your Home on the Cheap," Items like decks, patios, gazebos, and arbors always cost more than you think. However, there are many sophisticated landscapes that use recycled materials. Used wood, bricks, and even broken concrete can be inexpensive alternatives to pricey pavers and new materials.;
,


Think about dividing & Propagating your existing plants. There are so many plants that can be easily divided or propagated, there might be no need to buy new plants.

If you must buy plants, never purchase at the beginning of the season. Fall is usually a better time to plant and nurseries have racks of discounted plants. Most likely they won't be in bloom and the leaves will look ragged and spindly. Pop the plant out of its container and take a quick look at the roots. If they are not 'mushy' and the base (or 'crown')of the plant at the soil level looks in relatively good condition, you can be fairly sure of a safe purchase. Next spring when the plants come up or leaf out they will look just as good and be just as healthy as the plants that your neighbors paid three times as much for.

Ground covers can often be divided into dozens of individual plants and spaced several inches apart. A 4"" pot of creeping thyme, for example, can cover a 4-foot square of your garden within a matter of months using this technique.



, Plant in groups. Don't just think in three's. Think twenty, or maybe even more. This simplifies maintenance and replicates more closely how plants grow in the natural environment. Find two or three inexpensive plants that go really well together and fill an entire bed keeping like varieties together. For example, if a friend is pulling out a large clump of over-grown Sedum or iris or whatever, claim it and divide the plant into as small parts as possible (make sure each division has healthy connected roots). Plant each division several inches apart (depending on size) and within a year you will have what looks like a 10-year old landscape. Way too often a single large plant that costs $40 or more is planted 5' from the next. It take years for the landscape to fill in.

, As tempting as all those beautiful annuals are on the nursery shelves, think ahead. Every year you will need to replace them, as they die. This is one of the quickest ways to burn through a landscape budget. If you are willing to start annuals from seed (or any other plant for that matter) go for it! Just don't buy them in a pot (or pony packs, or flats). Perennials on the other hand get bigger and more attractive year after year. A single $2, 4"" potted perennial can be a 8-foot mound of color within three years. The annual will be about the same size as the pot and will have cost three times as much.

, What goes in the pot is what makes the planting. Go large! Just keep in mind that you can easily blow $100 or more on a pot. Small pots (anything under 12"") are very hard to maintain and look terrible in the enormity of the outdoors. They are best suited to the scale of a windowsill or a table top. Two or three large pots with only a variety or two of plants will serve any landscape well. Take a look at any stylish home and garden magazine featuring outdoor furniture. You don't see 30 little pots running down the side of a porch. They are all big, big, big. Terra cotta is an excellent choice for color (weather plastic or the real thing). You can find dozens of styles and they will all match. For some reason this color is usually much less than other finishes. Let the plants, not the pots steal the show.
If you don't have a green thumb, use drought tolerant perennials for those days you forget to water. Sedums, Heucheras, thyme, Alliums, and Artemisias make great choices. Grab divisions of your favorite plants right out your landscape, it won't cost a thing. If you are pretty confident that your thumb is a shade of green, a few annuals in select pots can add an all-summer splash of color (plant them from seed if you can). A restrained quantity of flashy accent annuals is justified in any budget. For example, a single 24"" pot of petunias on the front porch can add plenty of wow.

, Do you have rock that occurs naturally in your area of the country? Do not purchase rock. See what you can do to obtain it free. Visit construction sites sometimes works. Native stone looks so much better than extremely pricey rock that doesn't belong in your landscape in the first-place. Get the biggest rocks that you can safely lift and nestle them in your garden beds in small groups. However, don't over-do it. Three or four rock 'out-croppings' close to sidewalks or patio edge are plenty to spruce up your yard.

, If you have to spend money on the landscape spend it first on trees. you should always put trees in your landscape before anything else. It is worth a little extra money to get a good landscape tree. There are a lot of trash trees that will send up suckers, leave huge messes on your lawn, require hours of pruning, and die just as your landscape matures. For shade trees, named hybrid maples, oaks, and sycamores are almost always a safe bet. Avoid birches, most elms, poplars, and some ashes which grow fast, but are ultimately short-lived.Buy small.It is better to spend money on a small quality variety than a large trashy one. Most likely in five or six years you won't be able to tell the difference in size. Smaller trees also fare better when transplanted.

Due to the especially harmful effects of spores on the lungs, a N95 mask should be used. These can be bought at most hardware stores.
If you are allergic to mold or mold sensitive, cover as much of your skin as possible. Wear a long sleeve shirt and coveralls, in this case.;
, If you don't have any other options, you may clean mold from furniture inside, though you should open windows before starting.During the cleaning process you might accidentally spread mold spores. To prevent mold from spreading to other pieces of furniture or parts of your house, clean outdoors.


If you move the furniture outside, slit a garbage bag or two and tape the bag(s) around the furniture. This will prevent the spread of spores when transporting the furniture through your house.
Many cleaning agents, like bleach, give off harmful fumes. At minimum, you should clean in a well-ventilated area.

, A vacuum with an arm attachment and a HEPA filter will suck up loose spores along with dust and dirt. Pass the vacuum slowly over moldy areas several times.When emptying the bag or canister of the vacuum, do so outside and into a plastic bag. Seal the bag tightly and throw it away., Very light mold and musty smells can often be eliminated by airing your furniture out in sunlight. Position the furniture outside in the early morning, after the dew has evaporated (if there is any). Bring the furniture back inside at sunset. Repeat this for another day or two if necessary.


Even when dealing with light mold, be sure you wear gloves, an air mask, and googles. Light mold still produces harmful spores.
Mold thrives on moisture. If your home climate is humid, place your furniture in a small room with a dehumidifier for similar results to a sunlight cleaning.To improve the mold fighting power of the sunlight, mix equal parts water and white vinegar and lightly spray the furniture in the morning when placing it outside., Light mold, or mold that resisted a sunlight cleaning, can be handled with a spray bottle and cheap vodka. Add the vodka to the spray bottle and mist the whole piece of furniture. Allow it to air dry in direct sunlight for best results.Wood that is painted or stained isn’t likely to have been penetrated below the surface by the mold. In these cases, mild cleaners should work.

, Mold that withstood sunlight and vodka can often be removed with a mild household detergent. Mix dish soap in a bucket of warm water and gently scrub moldy areas with a soft bristle brush with a circular motion.When finished cleaning, wipe the surface of your furniture with a damp towel. If no mold remains, wipe the wood once more with a dry rag. If mold remains, repeat this process.
Before doing this, you should try brushing an out of sight area on the furniture with the solution first. Some brushes may damage certain finishes., Distilled white vinegar is an excellent mold killing agent. Should dish soap be too weak to remove the mold, add vinegar to a spray bottle. Spray the furniture thoroughly with the vinegar. Wait about an hour, then wipe the surface with a damp cloth.


Reapply the vinegar again in this fashion if necessary. Wipe the wood thoroughly with a dry rag when the mold is removed., In a bucket, mix together a household detergent, like dish soap, bleach, and water. Use a quarter cup (59 ml) of detergent, 2½ cups (591 ml) of bleach, and 5 cups (1.2 L) of water. Stir the solution with a utensil to evenly distribute the ingredients.Only mold on the surface of your wooden furniture will be removed by bleach alone. Mold that has sunk roots into the wood will require a surfactant added, like detergent.Bleach can lighten or completely whiten the colors of some dyed cloth, like clothing or carpet. Take care when handling bleach, and consider wearing a smock or clothes you don’t mind throwing away.

, Dip a stiff bristle brush or a scrub sponge into your bleach solution. Use moderate pressure and move your cleaning tool in circles as you clean. After thoroughly cleaning moldy areas, allow the furniture to air dry. Repeat this process a second time if necessary.For best results, move the furniture outside, clean it as described with the bleach solution, and then allow it to air dry in the sunshine.
Using a stiff bristle brush on wooden furniture could damage its finish. If this happens to your furniture, you’ll have to refinish the wood.
If the bleach solution does not completely remove the mold, its roots may be sunk too deeply in the wood to be removed by cleaning agents alone., Use a fine grit (120 to 220 rating) sandpaper to lightly sand the moldy areas.Sand while the wood is still damp to prevent spores from spreading. Clean sanded areas with the bleach solution after sanding and air dry the furniture.


Even lightly sanding finished wood will cause damage to the finish and require refinishing once the mold is removed."

You may exhibit some symptoms of mold exposure, experience musty smells, or even see the wood floors warping.Pay attention to any symptoms you may have. If you are suffering from mold exposure, you may experience headaches, itchy eyes, breathing problems, or difficulty concentrating.
Notice any musty smells. Mold gives off a gas that gives it a musty smell. If you notice this smell, you likely have mold, even if it is not visible in your house. See if your wood floors are warping. If there is any sign of warping of the wood, this means your mold problem is pretty far along. Try to start working on it as soon as possible. ;
, Mold can be dangerous, especially if do not take the proper precautions. Make sure you know the extent of the mold problem on your wood floors before you start cleaning


Consider the extent of mold. Test the mold depth. Press into the spot with a screwdriver or sharp tool. If the wood feels soft, the mold has spread below the surface and into the wood. This will require more than surface cleaning. Think about hiring a professional. If you have allergies to mold, a weakened immune system, or the mold covers more than 30 continuous square feet, consider calling in a professional to address the mold problem. Certain types of mold are highly toxic and exposure can lead to serious health complications.
Dry out the floor using room heaters or fans. All moisture in the wood needs to be eliminated prior to mold removal in order to protect the integrity of the floors and to prevent future mold growth.

, Make sure you have the necessary safety gear for cleaning and are using chemicals for cleaning safely.


Wear appropriate safety gear when working around mold or with chemicals. Gloves and safety glasses are sufficient for removing surface mold over small areas, no more than a few square feet. For deeper mold removal or over larger surface areas, use an N-95 mask or P-100 respirator in addition to gloves and safety glasses. Also, wear clothing and shoes that can be easily washed or disposed of after.Use the proper cleaner. For surface mold, you want to use a cleaner designed for urethane finishes. You can also use a chlorine bleach solution, with a water/bleach ratio of 10:1. Limit the spread of bleach solution to unaffected areas. Do not leave the bleach solution on the wood for longer than necessary, as it will remove the wood finish.
Read through the safety labels on any and all chemicals you use.
Wipe away the mold using a rag. For stubborn mold stains, use a firm-bristled hand scrubbing brush.

, This be be more difficult than removing surface mold. Make sure you take all the necessary precautions when doing so.

,


If the spot feels slightly soft, the mold can be removed.
If the wood feels spongy or crumbles, it may be rotten and not salvageable.
Don't try try to fix any ingrained mold that cannot be repaired. Try calling a professional first.

, Allow the room to air out for a few hours. Make sure your floors are totally dry. Ingrained mold needs to be dry before you remove it.
Let the room clear out before you start repairing your floors. Clear the room of any potentially harmful mold particles.
Keep the area well-ventilated. Even if you are wearing a mask, you do not want to inhale any mold particles.

, Make sure to use appropriate grit sandpaper so you do not damage the wood underneath


Use 100 grit sandpaper or a metal hand scraper to remove as much mold as you can.
Use 220 grit sandpaper to remove more ingrained mold. Be careful to not damage the floor underneath.
Sand in a circular motion. Only sand the affected area.
Spray diluted bleach onto the area to kill any live mold before it spreads.

, Make sure to complete all final steps after removing the worst of the mold. You want to get rid of your mold problem as best as you can.


Polish the affected area with 200 or 250 grit sandpaper until smooth. Wipe away the residue with a dry microfiber cloth. For bigger areas, use a vacuum to remove the debris.

, Try to find a wood finish that will cover up the mold stain and hopefully restore your wood floor back to normal.


Apply a wood finish that matches the original finish. Allow the finish to dry completely. For added protection against moisture in the future, apply a polyurethane finish to the wood. If you can't find the exact colored finish to match the original floors, use the next lightest shade.Double-bag all the debris. Use heavy-duty garbage bags. Carefully clean all equipment to prevent spreading mold spores to other areas.

, After cleaning your wood floors, you want to prevent having this problem again. Preventing future mold growth will make it less likely you’ll have to do this again.Mold needs moisture to grow. Keep an eye on your wood floors to make sure they are clean and dry. If you have wood floors in places that are prone to moisture, such as bathrooms, basements, or kitchens, make sure you clean up any surface moisture as soon as possible. Warm environments also encourage mold growth. Wood floors in any places that get warm, such as bathrooms or kitchens, need to be aired out to avoid mold growth.
Mold needs food. For wood floors, mold feeds on nutrients on the surface of the wood, but not on the wood itself. Keep your wood floors dry and clean to make sure mold does not have a food source.

, If your wood floors are clean and dry, then the conditions for mold are less likely to arise. Vacuum and mop your wood floors on a regular basis. While you may not have to clean your wood floors daily, make sure to incorporate it as part of your weekly cleaning routine.
Control humidity in your house. Mold grows best in humid environments. Consider buying a dehumidifier to keep a consistent level. Indoor humidity should be at about 50% to avoid most molds. Clean spilled water as soon as possible. Don’t let any water sit on your wood floor as that could lead to mold growth.

, Different seasons have different problems with mold growth. Air out your house during the colder months. When it’s colder outside, we tend to keep our homes warmer, which creates warm air that does not escape. Additionally, plants are dying in the fall and winter, which creates more opportunity for mold to grow. Keep your air conditioner maintained during warmer months. An overused air condition can create additional condensation. Make sure your air conditioner is in working order and not creating excess moisture."

These include flooding, water leaks, damp basements, HVAC duct systems or shower or cooking steam. Look for uninsulated exterior windows and walls, including uninsulated closets along exterior walls where mold can grow when you run your heating in the winter.Check the airflow in your home. Consult with a contractor to ensure your air conditioning unit is appropriately sized for your home.;
, Mold grows on organic food sources, including other mold. Search for discoloration around wallpaper, wallpaper glue, ceiling tiles, carpeting, paper, textiles, and wood products that indicate mold growth. Also check for excessive dirt and moisture near your walls., Look for patches of mold in colors ranging from white to orange and green to brown and black. Check for speckled or cottony growth on walls, especially near water-damaged surfaces. You may also see furry growth and black stains., Your basement and bathrooms might have the mustiest smells, which can be your first sign of a mold problem. Also check for a strong musty odor in walls, ceilings, floors, carpets, books, or piles of newspapers. Damp, mildewing textiles, like rugs and clothing, will also smell sour., Dry water that accumulates indoors after heavy rains. Use an indoor/outdoor vacuum on major puddles. After a flood, remove any water-damaged items that can’t be thoroughly dried, including carpets, bedding, and furniture.Don't leave wet clothes or towels lying around the house.
Hang clothes to dry after laundering them or put them in the drier immediately.
Dry wet spots on carpets and rugs within 24-48 hours.
Run an exhaust fan or open the window when you shower. Wipe down the floor and walls in your bathroom after a shower.
Regrade your yard so it slopes away from your home. If it slopes towards your house, water doesn’t collect in your basement or crawlspace.

, Lower humidity by running dehumidifiers and window air conditioners. Use fans, but only within 48 hours of flooding or else mold spores can be blown around. Avoid using heaters or turning up the heat in confined areas because mold grows more quickly in higher temperatures., Use a ½ percent bleach solution to clean the condensation pan under the coil of your central air conditioner. Also check to be sure the drain on your air conditioner is working properly. Seal any leaky air conditioner duct joints with flexible mastic.Sealing the ducts is especially important if they run through a hot attic where the heat and leaky cool air create moisture for mold to grow.
Clean all humidifiers, which both distribute mold throughout your home and give mold a place to grow. Use an antimicrobial solution to clean humidifier reservoirs.

, Wear rubber gloves, eye goggles, and an N-95 respirator. Look for the respirator at hardware stores. Also wear long sleeves and long pants that you can launder or discard immediately. Plan to undress in the room that you’ve cleaned of mold.Open the windows to ensure good ventilation when you clean.
You can also use a 3M#1860 or TC-21C particulate respirator.
After you clean, put the clothes in a plastic bag for the laundry or disposal so you don’t spread mold spores in other areas of your home.
Don’t let other people or pets into the space where you are cleaning the mold.

, First wet the surface you’ll clean to cut down on mold flying around while you scrub. Use the soap and a stiff bristled scrub brush to remove mold from hard plastic, glass, and metal. You might need to sand growth on structural wood, including wall studs., These can include paper, drywall, insulation, ceiling tiles, carpets, and carpet padding. Discard these carefully in sealed plastic bags. Replace any moldy wood trim and floorboards., Combine 1.5 cups (360 mL) of chlorine bleach with one gallon (3.785 L) of water. Wipe this on the surfaces that you’ve cleaned. Keep the area wet for 15-30 minutes so the bleach can effectively disinfect the surface., Use clean water to rinse after you’ve disinfected. Immediately dry the area you’ve cleaned. Use fans, open windows, and/or dehumidifiers to accelerate the drying process., Combat future mold by painting the area with an antimicrobial paint. Only paint after you have properly cleaned and dried the surface. If you don’t want an antimicrobial paint, choose a latex-based paint that will allow the air to flow through your interior walls and reduce future mold growth.Monitor the area frequently to prevent or address any future outbreaks.

",How to Landscape a Large Yard," This is the key to having success and being satisfied with the outcome of your landscaping adventure. You cannot just decide for landscaping if you do not plan for other important things that you need to do for your outdoor space. Divide your space accordingly and set just enough area for landscaping.


Plan for enough space. Consider things such as the playground for your kids or for your pets, your vegetable garden, your garage and other outdoor space ideas needed.;
, Include the lawn and at least roughly show the location of large trees, permanent structures, and other existing elements which need to be incorporated in your plan.

, Use these to show the slope of the land, noting conditions such as wetland sites, rocky areas, and anything else which will require special attention.

, Low places and wetlands are not suitable for growing most common lawn grasses, and rocky bare hill-tops do not support grass growth well, either, so another type of landscaping may be more suitable for these areas. Areas under deep shade, such as beneath a large, broad hardwood tree might be better suited for some patio stones and a bench or swing, and very steep hills can be covered with vines or small shrubs instead of something requiring mowing or other maintenance.

, Here in the south, we have pecan trees, blueberries, and grapevines which are often used in landscaping and provide a food source for wildlife, as well as ingredients for favorite recipes.


Choose the right plants. It is better and smarter to choose native plants. Although it can also be tempting to go for plants that are uncommon in your place, it is still best to opt for native plants as these kinds of plants are already familiar with the natural habitat you have in your property. It will be easier for you to grow them.
You can actually put other variety of plants, but make sure that you do not overcrowd your yard space with imported plants and always make room for the native ones.

, Look for other areas you can ""cut"", or take some soil off to spread to these places. Often in large landscaping projects you will find that you have to ""import"", or haul in additional soil to level out the lawn, and it is best to bring this material in before any underground utilities are installed.

, This is a math problem, and if the area is irregular in shape, try to imagine it as a square or rectangle, multiplying width X length X depth, to give you a cubic volume of material. Large volumes are measured either in tons or cubic yards or meters. If the amount is very large, you will need to hire someone to haul your material in with a dump truck, smaller amounts may be brought in with a pickup truck or utility trailer.

, If you have a large amount to move, you may want to rent a small tractor with a front end loader bucket and a grader blade or box blade to do this job for you. Very large projects may require a bulldozer or other heavy equipment, but this may be too much for the average homeowner to attempt on their own.

, After the landscaping is complete is not the time to build a swimming pool or utility shed!

,,, Large landscaping projects can be overwhelming if they are not broken down into a series of smaller projects.

, If you use an electric mower, leaf blower, weed eater, or edger, you may want a couple of remote ground fault receptacles to eliminate the need for long extension cords. You will need to mount these with weatherproof boxes and covers on posts or attached to some type of structure.

, Use landscape fabric in planting areas to keep the weeds from becoming a problem, and mulch all these areas to conserve water.

, This is often done by dragging a section of fence material behind a lawn tractor or ATV, passing back and forth over the area until it is smooth.

,, These are perfect for outdoor activities such as afternoon teas with friends, evening talks with your spouse and weekend picnics with your kids. However, experts advise not to add features that you cannot really maintain as this will only make your lawn look dull and old. Make sure that you can maintain the features in your landscaped lawn.


Clean the benches and chairs regularly as these can get easily damaged especially when they get wet during rainy days. Adding some features in your lawn can really add more beauty to its overall landscape design.

Correct any structural problems.,
Remove moisture from the basement.",How to Stop Mold Growth in Wet Basements1," Moisture control is the key to solving mold problems.If you have a wet basement, you will need to find out what is causing the water issues before you treat the mold problem. Common culprits include:Defective gutters
Groundwater seepage
Poorly designed window wells
Ineffective subsurface drainage system
Cracks in a house’s foundation
Internal sources of humidity like humidifiers or frequent cooking;
, The mold problem in your basement may be the result of internal sources of moisture, rather than moisture entering the basement from outside. Remove humidifiers from the basement, and do not cook in the basement unless absolutely necessary. Make sure other sources of moisture, like the clothes dryer and bathroom, are properly ventilated., Your basement could be wet due to a leaking pipe, sink, or toilet. Carefully examine these potential sources of moisture. If you discover a leak, fix the problem as soon as possible. If necessary, seek professional help., After removing internal sources of moisture, evaluate the gutters, downspouts, and surface grading around the house. If it appears that moisture is entering the basement from these places, contact a professional to evaluate and correct the problem., After you address underlying issues, remove any remaining moisture. If there is standing water or a puddle, you can remove it with a utility pump, air mover, and/or mop. You can also use a dehumidifier to help remove excessive moisture from the air. Make sure you remove as much moisture as possible before treating the mold."

Choose a color and texture of concrete that complements the natural surroundings and adjacent structures.,
Place the concrete.,
Color the concrete.,
Remember after initial floating and all excess bleed water has been absorbed, you should broadcast color hardener using a wide sweeping arm movement with the intention of covering as much concrete as possible with each throw.,
Apply the color release agent.,
Choose a color of release agent to complement the color of the concrete.,
Texture the concrete.,
Find a team to help you lay the mats.,
Use a high-powered pressure washer (3000 PSI is recommended, but be careful, concrete can be damaged) approximately 24 hours after the concrete has achieved initial set.,
Seal the concrete with an appropriate decorative concrete sealer according to manufacturer directions.,
Three dimensional stamped concrete is known as artificial rock which combines a stamped concrete technique with hand sculpting of the concrete.",How to Stamp Concrete," Special consideration should be given to the orientation of grout lines, particularly in repetitive patterns such as running bond, brick, or cobblestone. Generally, the area should be stamped so that long lines of the pattern run perpendicular to the length of the project. This will help reduce straight-line errors and provide a more pleasant and aesthetic overall appearance. Typically texture runs in straight lines, even when walks or drives are curved. Always perform a trial run, placing mats in the area prior to the pour. The crew should know ahead of time where the first mat will be placed, as well as aware of areas where a standard mat won't fit, and in what direction stamping will proceed. Always plan accordingly to ensure best results. It is very important to bear in mind the location of expansion and control joints(the thin lines you see in just about everything concrete). These will be required and may disrupt the visual pattern you had planned for. Your installer can direct you more with the options.;
, Follow normal procedures with a sub-grade and concrete base that meets the planned specifications and local requirements for mix, depth and reinforcement. A normal, or slow-set, water-reducing admixture, can be used, but admixtures must not contain Calcium Chloride. Yet, non-chloride accelerators and air-retaining admixtures can still be used. Refer to the admixture manufacturer for recommendations on the type and amount of admixture to use. (Please note: Some admixtures may affect color.) The concrete should be no less than four inches in thickness.

, There are two basic techniques:


Integral Color: Liquid Color into the ready mix truck. This procedure combines the color with the mix prior to the pour and the slab is colored throughout, or:
Broadcast Method: Apply color hardener powder directly to the freshly poured concrete surface. Color hardener will penetrate the top of the concrete slab 1/8"" and color thoroughly.

, Allow the hardener to be absorbed for several minutes until it has moistened sufficiently to work the color in with a wood or magnesium float. One pass with the float should be sufficient; do not overwork the concrete. If necessary, repeat this process in areas where natural concrete is showing through. When you are satisfied with the color, finish with a fresno or steel trowel.

, Texture mats will not work without the use of a release agent. This specially formulated powder prevents mats from sticking to freshly placed concrete. Generally 3.5 lbs. of material is required per 100 square feet. As the slab approaches its optimum set for texturing, the release agent should be applied. It should be brushed onto the mats and broadcast across the surface of the concrete. There should be a uniform layer of release between the concrete and the texture mats; thick enough to prevent damp concrete from bleeding through to the mat, yet thin enough so as not to diminish the texture detail.

, A release agent with a darker tone than the coloring agent will provide depth and shadowing in the finished concrete. Most of the release agent will be removed when the finished project is pressure washed. The primary concrete color will dominate and approximately 20% of the release agent will adhere to the surface of the concrete.

, At the optimum time for texturing, great force is not necessary to press the mat into the concrete. Timing is critical so work should proceed without delay once texturing begins. Likewise, inspect the area periodically so that necessary touch-up work can begin as soon as possible.

, Below is an outline of a four-man crew as suggested for the largest recommended project pour, 400 square feet. More experienced crews may be able to color and stamp as much as 700 square feet per pour, but it is recommended to begin with smaller areas. This process can be adapted to fit specific project needs.


Worker 1: Fluffs the release agent throughout the application process. Broadcasts release agent. Identifies areas that require touch up work. Acts as a general helper.
Worker 2: Places the texture mats. The first mat should be carefully aligned, placed and tamped in at the starting point of the project. Repeat the process by placing the second mat next to the first. Place mats tightly together to avoid messy grout line patterns. Continue with mats on hand, leapfrogging the mats as they are removed and replaced in the concrete. A minimum of three mats should be used for smaller pours. Larger projects require additional mats.
Worker 3: Tamps the mats as they are placed. Mats should be tamped straight down into the concrete using no more force than necessary to press the mat flush to the concrete. Do not over tamp!
Worker 4: Carefully removes the tamped mats by lifting gradually from one side first to break the suction. Passes mats to Worker 1 for preparation of next placement.

, This is to remove excess release agent from the surface of the concrete. Vary the distance of the wand to the surface of the concrete so that the release is unevenly removed. Try to spray so that some of the release remains in the grout lines and deeper indentations. This will result in a more natural, aged and shadowed effect.

, When the slab is thoroughly dry, clear enhancer should be applied using a roller. One gallon covers approximately 200 square feet. A light coat should be applied in one direction and a second coat should be applied in a perpendicular direction in order to avoid unwanted lines. Be careful to avoid a buildup of sealer in the corners.

, Integral colour is not used for this application but instead a water based paint process or acid stains are used.

Use a grape hoe, also called a grub hoe, to remove grass from small lawns. For larger lawns, or to save time and effort, rent a sod cutter from a tool rental service.Grass may be easier to remove when the soil is moist.
If using herbicides, follow all product safety information and allow enough time for the herbicide to break down in the soil. Most modern herbicides such as 2-4D and glyphosate (Roundup) will break down within three weeks if used correctly.;
, Grass seed will grow more evenly and root more firmly on relatively flat soil. While sod (turf) can be laid on slopes, grading soil is still recommended for flatter areas. To promote good drainage away from buildings, grade soil to a 1 or 2% slope away from a building.In other words, the soil should drop 1–2 feet across a distance of 100 ft (or 1–2 meters down per 100m distance).


While grading the soil, remove rocks and other large objects that could interfere with the lawn's roots. Do not bury construction debris or other materials not naturally present in your lawn, as this could harm the lawn roots., A lawn needs at least 4–6 inches (10–15 centimeters) of high quality topsoil in order to grow and stay healthy.If your soil has a sandy or clay-like texture, use a shovel to thoroughly work in organic material to this depth. You may use compost, rotted manure, peat, or high-quality topsoil purchased at a garden supply store.Do not just place the new material over the old. This can create layers of soil that can be difficult for water or roots to penetrate.Some varieties of perennial rye can grow roots well over a foot long, which is why well-worked soil and annual aeration is so important.

, If you want detailed information on your soil, take soil samples and send them to a soil testing laboratory. The laboratory will conduct tests and tell you whether additional nutrients or pH-altering materials are recommended for your lawn.


If you are in the US, look for a Cooperative Extension office in your area. Most of these will provide soil testing services.
If you do not have access to a soil-testing laboratory, you may find some information at home by testing your soil pH. Most larger retail nurseries carry home test kits. Most lawns prefer a soil pH of about 6.5–7.

, Starter fertilizer is high in phosphorus, which encourages root growth for new grass. Phosphorus is displayed using the middle number on the fertilizer package, so starter fertilizers are sometimes labeled 5-10-5 or 10-20-10. Always use the amount recommended on the fertilizer packaging, as too much fertilizer can kill plants. Do not till the fertilizer in deep; just rake it gently into the surface soil.If starter fertilizer is not available, use a balanced fertilizer (for instance, a 10-10-10 fertilizer).

, Assuming you needed to add in new soil or make significant grading adjustments, water in the new soil. For best results, let it settle for one week before planting., Grass will grow best when air pockets are removed from the soil, but not when the soil is too hard and compacted for roots and water to easily move through. Roll a light garden roller over the surface of the soil, filled no more than 1/3 of the way full of water.

, You may purchase strips of already-growing grass in the form of sod, called turf in some countries. This can take some effort to lay down, but will become usable soon after installation.Grass seed is much cheaper, but can take months to become a usable lawn, a constant fight with undesirable vegetation, and a year or two to become even and attractive.Grass seed is not recommended for significant slopes, as it can wash downhill during rain. Continue on to one of the sections below, depending on your choice.


There are other, less common methods of installing a lawn. ""Plugs"" are small pieces of sod that are planted at intervals, then allowed to spread across bare soil. ""Sprigs,"" also called ""stolons,"" are stems of grasses that creep along the ground, such as Bermuda or Zoysia. These can be treated as seeds, but take care that the larger nodes on the sprigs are under the soil and watered regularly., Sod, called turf in some countries, are strips of already-growing grass attached to soil. Grass comes in many varieties, so select one suitable for your climate and your intended purpose. Warm-season grass thrives during summer heat, while cool-season grass prefers cooler weather.


Grass types are discussed in more detail at the start of the section on grass seeds. Sod is often easier to choose, since you can see and feel the grass before purchasing.

, Grass cannot survive indefinitely on sod, so purchase newly cut sod. The attached soil should be moist, not dried out and crumbly.


Install the sod right away. Sod is often sprayed with a light dose of liquid nitrogen right before cutting. When left stacked on a pallet too long, the nitrogen can create heat that kills the sod.

, Lay out one line of sod along the edge of your lawn, placing the sod end to end. Start the next line of sod staggered with the first, as though you were laying down a line of bricks. Tuck or roll the seams together for best results, as though you were seaming carpet. Try to avoid stretching the sod or overlapping two pieces.

, If you need to fill a bare patch of dirt, or remove a section of sod that is overlapping another piece, cut a piece of sod into smaller pieces using a utility knife or a sharpened trowel.Make adjustments until there are no gaps between sod, and no overlaps either.

, Give your new lawn a thorough watering after installation. The water should go down all the way through the sod, into the soil beneath. When you lift a corner of the sod after this watering, it should be dripping wet.Water frequently during the first ten days, keeping the new lawn moist.


Water during the early morning when possible, to give the grass time to dry out before fungus can establish itself.
Do not water so much that it saturates the soil and causes pooling, as that will lift the sod off the soil and interfere with root growth.

, After the first ten days, water less frequently. Continue to water heavily enough to work water well into the topsoil, as this encourages root growth. Check the edges of the lawn for wilting, and water more heavily there if necessary.

, Avoid using the lawn during the first week or so, and use it as lightly during the first month. After this time, the lawn should be well-established, and can be used as usual.

, Let the new lawn grow out to at least 2.5 in (6.5 cm) before mowing. Do not mow while the sod is wet and soft, and make sure the lawn mower blades are sharp. Light, hand-pushed mowers are recommended until the sod has established deep roots, which can take several weeks.

, Most ""warm-season"" grasses go dormant and brown in cool temperatures, while ""cool-season"" grasses will not stay green during summer heat.Decide which type is best for your climate, or consult a local experienced in planting lawns, or based on the current time of year and temperature.


Cool-season grasses, such as Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass, and fescues, should be sown in autumn, when upper soil temperatures are between 68 and 86ºF (20–30ºC).Warm-season grasses, such as bahiagrass, centipede grass, carpet grass, and buffalo grass are best sown in spring or summer, when upper soil temperature is between 68 and 95ºF (20–35ºC)., If you have one particular look in mind, you may want to pick a single grass species. More commonly, grass seeds are sold in blends (varieties of a single species) or mixtures (combinations of multiple species) to provide better resilience to disease and environmental factors. Browse blends and mixtures to find one suited to your lawn's sunlight levels, your preferred grass texture, drought resistance, and durability to foot traffic.Avoid purchasing low-quality seed blends using the following tips:


Look for advertised germination percentages above 75%, and an expiration date no more than ten months in the past, for best sprouting results.Look for grass seed containing less than 0.5% weed seeds.
Avoid annual ryegrass, which dies permanently in winter. Avoid rough ""agricultural"" perennial ryegrass, or mixtures that include more than 20% of any type of ryegrass, or it can take over your lawn with its rough texture and appearance.Avoid grass seeds sold without an identifying variety.

, Divide large lawns into sections measuring approximately 20 ft x 20 ft (6m x 6m). Work on each section separately, following the steps below for that section before moving on to the next one. This lets you divide your work into multiple work sessions if necessary, while ensuring that every section receives all the care it needs., Spread grass seed using a seed distributor or lawn spreader if possible, to ensure even coverage. Drop the seeds by hand if no other options are available, but always refer to the recommended sowing density on the grass seed package. For even distribution, sow half the recommended seeds while walking in parallel rows back and forth lengthwise across the lawn, then sow the remaining half while walking in rows widthwise. If there is no recommended seed density on the packaging, use the following guidelines:Utility grass (designed for moderate to heavy use) can be sown at ½ ounces per square yard (15–20 grams per square meter).
Most ""ornamental"" grass (designed for light use) can be sown at ¾ oz per sq yd (20–25g per sq m).
High quality ornamental grass can be sown at 1 oz per sq yd (30g per sq m).

, Use a rake to cover the majority of the seeds with a light layer of soil, no deeper than 1/8 inch (3 mm).This protects the seeds from birds and wind, but still makes it easy for the young grass sprouts to push through the soil.For grass seeds sown in the summer, a thin layer (¼ in. or 6mm) of mulch can help retain moisture.Straw or hay mulch is not recommended, as it may contain weed seeds.

, Put up signs or temporary barriers if necessary to keep people off the lawn. Do not step on the soil at all until the grass has germinated, which usually takes 10–14 days. Walk across it as infrequently and lightly as possible for about six months after planting.

, Letting the seed dry out completely will prevent germination. To prevent this, water the seeds immediately after planting with a light sprinkler, just to the point of ""puddling."" Repeat frequently throughout each day until sprouts appear. After this occurs, water less often, but more heavily, now that the established plants won't be washed away.The exact frequency of watering depends on the temperature, humidity, and grass variety. Increase the watering frequency if the grass turns brown, unless it is the dormant season (winter for warm-season grass, or summer for cold-season grass).


If using a blend with Kentucky bluegrass, keep watering with the gentle, more frequent schedule after the first sprouts appear. Look closely for the next few days for a new layer of small seedlings to sprout, as ""KBG"" can take longer to germinate than other species.After this second wave of sprouts appears, you can switch to a less frequent watering schedule.

, Once the grass reaches this height, press it down with a light garden roller – either an empty metal one, or a plastic one filled with about 1 gallon (4 liters) of water.If you do not have a garden roller, you may attempt to lightly press the grass into the soil with the wheels of a rotary mower, or by treading across it carefully, but try not to press it so hard that the soil becomes hard and compacted., Do not mow a new lawn until it reaches this height, as it needs uninterrupted time to focus on growing roots. Mow in small increments once it reaches this height, no more than ½ in. (1¼ cm) at a time, and wait at least a few days between mowing.Once the grass has reached the desired height and the lawn is well-established, mow according to preference. Never remove more than 1/3 of the grass height at a time.

Dilute any urine spots on the lawn right away.,
Construct an area with mulch or gravel for your dog.,
Use urine-resistant grass in your lawn.,
Keep your lawn healthy and well maintained.,
Put up a fence to protect your lawn.,
Post a sign asking dogs and people to stay off your grass.",How to Keep Pet Urine from Damaging Lawn1," As soon as you notice any urine spots on your lawn, you should pour several cups of water on the spot to dilute the urine. Diluting the spots with water can help them to fade faster.Another option is to give the entire lawn a watering if there are multiple urine spots on the lawn. Most dogs will go to the bathroom in the same spots in the yard so you may check these areas periodically and water them well if there are urine spots.;
, You can also address this issue by creating a bathroom area for your dog that is made of gravel, mulch, or artificial turf. This could be located on one side of your yard or in the area where your dog usually goes to the bathroom. Having your dog go on this area will save the rest of your lawn from damage due to urine.You should make this area appear more appealing to your dog by placing greenery like potted hostas or ferns around the perimeter of the area.

, For a more permanent solution, you should put in grass that is urine-resistant or that can tolerate dog urine. Put in fescue and perennial ryegrass, as these are more resistant than other grasses. As well, any diluted urine on these grasses actually act as fertilizer and help them grow.You should avoid Kentucky Bluegrass and Bermuda grass, as these are the most sensitive to urine and will spot easily.

, Making sure your lawn is healthy and maintained on a daily or weekly basis will help to keep it more resistant to urine damage. You should make sure you use nitrogen fertilizer when you fertilize your lawn, as the nitrogen can help to neutralize the urine.If you notice the urine spot appears green and there is no browning in the area, you should increase the frequency of fertilization (with nitrogen fertilizer) or the amount of fertilizer to mask the urine spots. You should also make sure you water the law on a frequent basis so the grass stays healthy.If you notice the urine spots have turned brown and the grass appears to be dying, you should water the area more frequently to help dilute any salts from the urine that have accumulated in the soil. If the grass eventually dies, consider replacing the dead sod with new grass that is urine-resistant., Fences and motion-sensor sprinklers can be used to keep neighboring dogs from eliminating on the lawn. Put up a wooden or wire fence to protect your lawn from unwanted urine patches.You can also use chicken wire to fence around the damaged area so your dog cannot relieving himself on the same spot again.

, Another way to prevent urine on your lawn is to post a sign at the front of your yard asking dogs and people to “mind the grass”. This could encourage people walking by with their dogs to not let their dogs relieve themselves on your yard.


You can also politely ask your neighbors to keep their dogs off your lawn. Stop by your neighbors, and let them know that you've been getting lawn damage from their dogs. Politely suggest that they walk their dogs in nearby parks or areas away from your house.

Use a sod-cutting spade or tree-planter's dibble to cut the lawn in the desired shape of your flower bed.,
Remove the sods: Cut the sod into pieces.,
Dig a trench at the edge of your line: The trench should be as deep as your plastic lawn edging PLUS 2.5 cm.,
Unroll your plastic lawn edging and cut to the desired length.,
Go against the curl of the edging, slide it into the trench, placing it on the grass side of the trench so that the top of the edging is just level with the base of the growing grass.,
Use soil (back fill your trench) to hold the edging in place as you work in sections along the length of your flower bed.

,
If your desired edge line is wavy, you may need lawn edging stakes to hold the edging in a curve.,
Tamp down the backfill immediately adjacent to the edging using your foot sideways (compact the soil).,
Know that if the grass tries to invade from the top, just pull it up.",How to Install Plastic Lawn Edging," It is most effective to make the cuts straight downwards (vertical), as this will provide the proper angle for the lawn edging. Push your spade down below the level of the grass roots (at least 10 inches). Now, lever the handle of your spade downward to lift up the sod you wish to remove. This completely loosens all of the grass roots.;
, Turn the sods upside down and hit the soil-laden roots with the flat part of your spade to loosen the soil. Don't cut the roots with the edge of your spade as this will create root cuttings that will grow if left in your flower bed. Shake out this soil into your flower bed. Toss the sods in your compost upside down where they can decompose, if you so desire.

, For example, if you are using 4-inch deep lawn edging, the trench will be 5 inches deep on the grass side.

, The edging will have a natural curl from being wound into a circle for packaging. Unroll the circle so that the outside of the curl faces your flower bed.

, The top of the edging DOES NOT stick above the lawn; it will be almost buried and just visible after you back fill your trench!

,, These are installed horizontally at the base of the lawn edging by hammering them through the edging, just above the reinforcement strip into the soil under the lawn. They are *not* placed vertically.

, The level of the soil should come up to, but not above, the top of the edging. Adjust the soil height as needed and tamp again.

, When you mow the lawn, you can run one wheel on the soil, right over the edging and have no trimming to do.

Do this at least two weeks before you start your project to give it time to work and kill off all of the vegetation in the area. This will help to ensure that all of the plant material is dead down to the roots.
, If installing the lawn over soil, dig up the top 3 or 4 inches (7.5–10 centimeters) of sod to make room for the new base. You can use a small rototiller to help you dig up the lawn and break up the soil. Remove all existing grass and other plants, or they may create an uneven surface after they die.








Let rain-soaked soil dry for a few days before you excavate, to prevent slumping.While the remaining surface doesn't need to be perfectly graded, walk over it or use a hand tamp to compact any obviously loose soil. A slight slope is recommended to improve drainage.

, Installations over well-draining soil should have few issues with drainage, as the artificial grass should be permeable to water, and the aggregate base described below provides an additional drainage layer. If you are installing the lawn over poorly-draining soil or a hard surface such as concrete, take the following precautions:









If there is no drain near the lawn, install a drainage system before you continue.
If your area only experiences light rainfall, it may be enough to leave small drainage gaps every 6"" (15 cm) around the perimeter., Install a waterproof border along the perimeter if one is not already present, in order to keep the lawn from slumping or separating over time. A plastic bender board is a common, effective option.








If you're interested in a more involved overhaul, you can pour a concrete curb around the area instead.
Make sure the border won't protrude above the grass level, or it may inhibit drainage.

, If you are concerned about weeds growing through your artificial grass, lay out a geotextile barrier at the bottom of the excavated area.This may also help deter gophers and earthworms from digging through your synthetic turf.









Keep in mind that a geotextile barrier is a tightly woven, fairly heavy weed blocker. You can purchase one from an artificial turf supplier, at a true nursery or garden center, or from a landscape and irrigation supply business. A geotextile barrier is not the same thing as a weed blocker that you might buy from a home improvement store.
You may install this over the base material instead.
If you have a major rodent issue, consider a layer of rodent wire as well.
Contact a professional rodent and pest control business for help to remove rodents. If left alone, rodents will wreak havoc on your artificial lawn.

, Purchase fine crushed rock, gravel, or decomposed granite, with particles under ⅜"" (10 mm). Fill the excavated area with about three to four inches (7.5–10 cm) of this material to prevent slumping and improve drainage.









You'll need approximately one cubic yard of material for each 100 square feet of lawn (0.82 cubic meters per 10 square meters).The information available for your specific product may provide a more accurate coverage estimate.
If installing the lawn over concrete or another hard surface, a rubber shock pad or self-leveling compound can work instead.Alternatively, you can skip this step if you are certain the concrete has adequate slope for drainage and that you can completely cover the edge of the slab with the artificial grass.
If children will be playing on the artificial lawn, then you may want to go with a shock pad for safety reasons.

, Use a landscaping rake to smooth out the base material. Use a bubble level, string, and ruler to grade flat surfaces to a 2–3% slope (a 2–3 foot drop per 100 feet), sloping down to the drainage system or curb.







, Sprinkle the gravel or sand lightly with a garden hose (be sure not to over water) to lubricate the particles in preparation for compaction. Use a plate compactor, roller compactor, or hand tamp to compact the material into a sturdy base, reducing it to 90% or less of its original depth (a drop of about 0.3 inches / 7.5 mm).This will likely require several passes back and forth over the area. Go in different, overlapping directions on each pass for best compaction results.









A vibratory plate compactor is the most effective option for this purpose.These tools are available from tool rental services. The hand tamp is the cheapest to purchase permanently.

, Unroll the artificial turf somewhere to the side, as it may take a couple hours to recover its shape after being transported in rolls. Wait until the base dries, then make sure it is smooth and firm before you continue.









If the base is not smooth, it needs more compaction.
If the base ended up lower than expected, you may need to pour in and compact an additional layer, to ensure a fairly flat join between the artificial turf and surrounding surfaces.

, Measure the area where the lawn will be laid out, and the width and length of the turf strips. With a partner, stretch out each strip of turf and lay it down over the prepared base. Avoid dragging the lawn over the base, or you may disturb the smooth surface.








In most artificial turf, the fake grass blades bend in one direction. Make sure all the turf is installed with the blades in the same direction, or your grass will look less natural.

, Use a carpet cutter or utility knife to cut the underside of the turf whenever required by the shape of the project area.








When making long cuts, cut short distances at a time and compare to the edge to make sure there are no significant gaps. Drawing the cut line onto the back with a marker may also help.

, For best results, use a carpet stretcher to stretch the turf strips just before you seam or fasten them, as described below. Press the stretcher flat against the turf with the bristles facing down, and kick the padded end firmly with your knee. Stretching the turf eliminates wrinkles, reduces expansion from heat, and helps secure the surface tightly to the ground.








This tool is also called a carpet kicker.

, There are several ways to join two strips of synthetic turf. A product made by the same company that sold your turf may provide the best results, since it will be designed for use on your lawn. Here are the most common options:









Line up the two strips close together, then fold the edges back and lay artificial lawn seaming material on the exposed base. Cover the seaming material with the accompanying adhesive product, then fold the strips back over the seaming material and let dry.Use the manufacturer's recommended adhesive only.

Or lay a length of seaming tape or strong outdoor tape on the ground and place the two strips on top of it.Or fasten together with stakes, approximately one every three inches (7.5 cm).

, Use 4–6 inch (10.2–15.2 cm) galvanized stakes or landscaping anchor pins to fasten the turf around the perimeter, at 6 inch (15 cm) intervals. Hammer them flat, but avoid excessive hammering, which can cause dips in the lawn.








For maximum strength, offset the stakes on opposite sides, rather than using two lines of stakes exactly opposite each other., Most artificial turf requires added particles to keep the bristles standing, weigh the grass down, and provide cushioning for athletic activities. While the lawn is completely dry, apply a thin layer of one of these materials, by hand or using a drop spreader. Rake in each layer to smooth it out. Repeat until approximately half the blade length is covered.For best results, use the material and amount of material specified by your product's manufacturers. These are the most common options:









Washed silica sand is used primarily as ballast to weigh the turf down. If your turf requires infill, sand alone may not be enough.
Black crumb rubber provides the most cushioning and support for the grass blades. They may make a mess if the lawn is installed on a slope, or if pets use the lawn as a toilet.
Copper slag absorbs odors from pets better than other options.Some dense products do not require infill. Some professionals prefer to add infill anyway for strength, although this is a somewhat controversial topic.

, After each raking of infill material, use a power broom to ""bloom"" your turf, brushing up the grass blades. If you cannot find a power broom, use a stiff nylon-bristled broom or carpet rake.








, This will help the infill or ballast settle. Check the material the next day to see the final result. If the lawn isn't bouncy enough or too much of each grass blade is exposed, rake in another layer of infill.









Optionally, use a leaf-blower to clear debris from the surface once finished.

Position the spray tip at least 2 feet (0.61 m) (0.6 m) from the surface to start.,
Hold the nozzle at a 45-degree angle to the surface.,
Move the spray in a side-to-side motion, without spraying too long in any one spot.

Keep your dog well-hydrated.,
Give your dog high-quality dog food.,
Train your dog to go to the bathroom on a specific area of the lawn.,
Talk to your vet before you give your dog urine neutralizing supplements.",How to Keep Pet Urine from Damaging Lawn2," Though it may seem counterintuitive to water your dog to prevent urine spots, making sure your dog is well-hydrated can help to dilute the strength of the nitrogen in his urine. You should make sure your dog has enough water throughout the day.You can also add water to his canned food or his dried food to ensure he is getting enough liquids.
Another fun way to keep your dog hydrated is to place ice cubes in a rubber toy. Your dog will then play with the toy and lick the ice cubes.

, Most high-quality dog foods contain higher-quality protein sources, which are easier for your dog to digest and less likely to leave by-products in his urine that could damage your lawn. Look for dog food that has a balanced pH and an ingredients list of mostly or all digestible foods.If you have a less active dog, you should look for dog food that is lower in protein. Lower-protein food will mean your dog will release less nitrogen when he pees. Less protein is also good for less active dogs as this will allow them to stay healthy and avoid gaining unnecessary weight.
Talk to your vet before you change your dog’s diet to ensure it is the right move for your dog.

, You can do this by first creating a graveled or mulched area of your lawn that will act as your dog’s outdoor bathroom area. Then, take your dog to this area when he indicates he needs to go to the bathroom. Have him stand in the area while he goes and give him positive reinforcement in the form of a treat once he finishes.You may need to continue to bring your dog to the spot and praise him for a period of time until he gets into the habit of using the area.
You should also maintain this outdoor bathroom so it is appealing to your dog by picking up any feces on the mulch or gravel. You can also spray down the mulch or gravel periodically to remove any urine.

, These supplements can be purchased over-the-counter, and claim to help neutralize the nitrogen in your dog’s urine. These medications work by changing the pH of your dog’s urine or by adding salt to your dog’s body. However, these medications can cause health issues in dogs, such as bladder stones or urinary crystals. Make sure you speak to your vet before giving your dog these supplements.You should also speak to your vet before adding natural options like gypsum salts or cranberry juice to your dog’s food to balance the pH of his urine.

Infill.",How to Install a Synthetic Grass Lawn," You can use a sod cutter for this task. A sod cutter can be rented from your local tool rental company or home good store. The advantages of a sod cutter are: they cut evenly across the lawn, they are much less destructive to existing water lines and irrigation and if you have grass you can roll it up and dispose of it which saves time.;
, While you can get away with less, you won't get as good drainage which can be especially important if your turf will be coming in contact with pets and their associated byproducts (ie. urine and feces).

, The advantages to using bendaboard are that your turf will definitely not come up and cannot be pulled up by dogs. Alternatively you can use 60d six inch nails every 4 inches (10.2 cm) on the perimeter.


If you elect to use a bendaboard border, be sure to use a composite board material that will not corrode. Wood won't suffice.
Dig a slight trench along the border approximately six inches deep using a ""mud gun"" (layman's term for a small jackhammer with a shovel bit - can be rented) or a trenching pick and trenching shovel.
Put the bendaboard in the trench so the top of the bendaboard is approximately one inch to 3/4"" below the finished surface - for example, if the turf lawn has a cement slab next to it, the bendaboard border should be about one inch below the slab height.
Stake the board to the ground so it is secure and backfill with gravel or the dirt that was excavated and compact thoroughly.

, Alternatively you can reconfigure them to ""spritz"" the turf and keep the irrigation system. This works well for really hot days to cool the turf or for pet owners who want to wash the turf down automatically.

, Quarter inch self compacting gravel is recommended. Large gravel - half inch or above - will make getting a nice grade very difficult. Add gravel so it comes about a quarter inch above the bendaboard and is higher in the middle. If your area is a 20' by 20' square, it's best to make the middle of your install one inch higher than the edges. This will create a nice ""mound"" look. Flat synthetic turf installs have a tendency to look fake!


One cubic yard of gravel will cover 300 square feet one inch thick. Also, one cubic yard will weigh about 2000lbs.

, Rake using a 36"" aluminum grading rake. This rake has teeth on one side and the back has a flat grading blade. Rake out the low spots as best as possible. Using a vibrating plate compactor (another rented item), wet the area moderately with a hose and go over the area from outside in one time.

, It should be pretty wet at this point, not flooded but as though it had rained heavily for about ten minutes.

, At the end you will have little lines from the edge of the plate compactor. Work these out with the flat edge of your rake. You will also have gravel shifting upwards at your edges where the plate compactor pushed the gravel up by the bendaboard. Remove this or your install will look fake. You may need a fine broom to remove the excess from the lines and excess material on the edges.

, Depending on your conditions, this may or may not be a benefit. If you had a lot of paspalum, zoysia or bermuda grass it would be a good idea unless it was thoroughly killed.

, There are a few things to know here. The turf usually comes in 15 foot (4.6 m) widths and you always want to seam width wise. It is much harder to seam lengths together.


If your area is 20 feet (6.1 m) by 20 feet (6.1 m), for example, you will need one fifteen foot wide section that is twenty feet long, and a second section that is 5 feet (1.5 m) wide and twenty feet long. Unfortunately the remaining ten foot wide by twenty feet long section would be an unused remnant. Unroll the first section, laying it close to the edge and leaving a few inches to spare in front and back lengthwise. For example if your area is 20x20 cut a strip about 20'6"" long. Lay out your next section of 5' wide and 20' long.

, Before cutting too close around the edges, cut out the excess factory material from the sides. We cut the third stitch in. Once you have cut stitches out you now know you have two straight edges that can be put together for your seam.

, You have a few options. You can glue your seam or you can use staples or nails. Using glue and professional seaming tape is recommended. This gives a seam that is hard to detect and allows you to not have nails in the field. This is important for playgrounds as well as the stretching process.


To do the seam get the two turf pieces next to each other, emulating the distance between them which duplicates the stitching in the turf. What this means is if the stitches are 3/8"" apart, you should pull the two turf pieces together until the stitches are 3/8"" apart. If you are too close you will have a ""mohawk"" effect in which too many blades are competing for space. If you are too far it will look empty. Too far is better than too close though.
Once you get your spacing right and the seam looks good, put some nails about 18"" away from your seam. Just a few nails partially in every few feet will do. The nails are just to keep your turf from shifting at all.
Now pull back each piece of turf leaving a couple feet of gravel exposed. Lay out your seaming tape (the tape should be 12"" wide). Spread your glue over your seaming tape and trowel out so it covers the tape evenly but thinly.
Let sit for about ten minutes to get tacky. Put the turf back down over the seaming tape, being careful not to let the blades get stuck in the glue. Put bags of sand or similar over the entire seam to make sure it doesn't shift.

, You are now ready to stretch the turf. For most installs, you can stretch lengthwise only and don't need to stretch width wise. If the area is under 400sqft, you can get away with stretching from one side only.


To do this, pull the turf so it lines up well with the bottom or top of your install then fasten the turf to your bendaboard or nail the turf down using your six inch nails.
Using your feet, kick out the turf from the nailed side, trying to get out any wrinkles. Put six inch nails halfway in every 3 feet (0.9 m) out and 5 feet (1.5 m) wide so you don't lose your stretch. Keep stretching and nailing until you get to the other side.
Once you get to the other side you can make your final cuts by the edge or bendaboard and use your screws or nails to fasten the turf. You can make your final cuts and fasten the sides at this time as well. Once you have nailed or screwed down the perimeter you can remove all the nails in the field.

, Your last step is applying the infill. Infill helps keep your blades upright, gives the turf a more realistic look and helps keep your turf cool. For infill choices you have silica sand (cleaned beach sand, basically), Durafill (acrylic coated sand, usually green in color), crumb rubber (provides some fall rating but some have reported it can be a bit toxic), and deodorizing infills for pets (a good example is Zeofill). For most purposes sand is fine. If you have a lot of dogs we recommend a product like Zeofill to reduce odors).


To apply the infill, use a power-broom (or a lot of power and a heavy duty push-broom) and make the blades stand upright. Then use a drop spreader or carefully use a flat shovel and apply the infill to the turf at a rate of 1.5 lbs/sqft. After applying brush again until the sand or other infill is evenly distributed. If your turf has a dusty look at this point just hose it down and you are done!

",How to Install a Sprinkler System," This will enable you to plan the routing of pipelines and placement of sprinkler heads so you can purchase your materials.;
, These will be your ""zones"", or areas which will be watered as a unit. Larger areas will require special heads and a higher volume of water than you can normally get from a residential water system.

,, Rain Bird R-50's, a common good quality head, will spray an arc, semicircle, or full circle about 25–30 feet (7.6–9.1 m) in diameter, so heads can be placed about 45 feet (13.7 m) apart to allow some overlap.

, You should find the typical gear drive head can be rated from 1.5 gpm to 4 gpm, depending on the nozzle diameter. Fixed pop-ups generally run about 1 gpm. Add the total of gpm of the zone's heads, and use this number to size your pipe. As a rule of thumb, a zone with 5-7 heads should require about 12-15 gpm, with the water pressure supplied at a minimum of 20 psi (pounds per square inch). To supply this zone you will need a one inch main pipe (line), with 3⁄4 or 1⁄2 inch (1.9 or 1.3 cm) branch lines from your main.

,, You can route a branch line to more than one head if you use a 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) pipe, but two should be the limit. Further down the line, you may decrease the size of the main to 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm), also, since near the end it will be supplying only 2 or 3 heads.

, Digging the ditch does not have to be precise if you are using PVC (polyvinyl chloride) pipe, as this material will bend fairly easily.

, Use an axe or grubbing hoe to cut the turf, taking care to set it aside in clumps so it can be replaced when you are finished. Use a trenching shovel to dig the ditch at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) below the frost level for your area. The ditch should be at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep to protect the pipe even in warm climates.

, ""Funny pipe"" is a flexible butyl rubber pipe used in sprinkler systems, which has its own unique fittings that slip into the pipes without glue or clamps, and adaptors to thread it into the PVC branch lines and the sprinkler heads. This product allows the heads to be adjusted for height, and is forgiving if you are prone to drive over the head with a riding lawn mower or vehicle.

,,, Be sure to use a backflow preventer so that if the water system loses pressure you will not syphon water from the sprinkler system into the potable water, causing a potential contamination.

, This should only take a minute or two, but doing this before installing your sprinkler heads will prevent clogged heads later on.

, Place the heads, according to your plan, where you have chosen them to go. Bury the head deeply enough that the soil will support them and they will be slightly recess below the top of the turf at your preferred mowing height. Pack the soil firmly around the heads to hold them in position.

, You can change the total rotation of gear drive heads from O degrees to 360 degrees, and the spray pattern and distance with the adjusting features designed in your particular head. Because this can vary greatly from one manufacturer to another, read the literature that comes with your heads.

Pick which grass is best for your climate.,
Know when to start.,
Test your soil.,
Prepare your soil.,
Level out the area.",How to Grow a Lawn Easily1," Depending on where you live you will have better luck with some grass varieties than others. Grasses fall into two basic categories: warm-season and cool-season.Warm-season grasses will be able to survive a brutal summer and tend to do well in the southern states. Choose from varieties such as Bermuda, St. Augustine, and Kikuyu.Cool-season grasses handle cold much better than warm-season grasses. They can tolerate freezing temperatures and some drought. Don't expect them to survive the heat or go longer than 4 weeks without water. Kentucky bluegrass is a popular cool-season grass.;
, If you choose a warm-season grass, plant in late-spring. If you choose a cold-season grass, plant in late summer or early fall.If you're going with sod, the time of year doesn't matter as much, though summer may still be too hot.

, Before you get started planting grass, you'll need to make sure your soil is in good condition. It's a good idea to test your soil. Soil testing will give you an idea of how much fertilizer to use, and what kind.It is difficult to amend soil in an established lawn.If you need to add fertilizer work it into the first 4-6 inches., This is a critical step. Soil preparation is the most important part of healthy lawn growth. Your goal is a soil that is loose, rich in organic matter, and able to hold moisture while draining well.








Clear the area of all weeds, rocks, and roots. Using a shovel dig up any large objects in the area where you'll be planting grass. Make sure you get rid of all weed roots.You may have to use a chemical weed killer to get rid of weeds completely. If you must use chemicals, refer to the manufacturer for instructions on how much to use.Till your soil either by hand or using a rototiller depending on the size of the area. This is the perfect opportunity to mix any compost or other amendments to your soil.Add gypsum to your soil to improve drainage., Now that you've cleared and tilled the area, it is ready for leveling. Use a garden rake and smooth out the entire area. Fill in any low spots and break up any remaining clumps.








While leveling the area it is a good idea to apply a ""grade,"" or slope, away from the house foundation. Applying a grade will help you avoid any water runoff problems in the future."
"
Divide your clumps.,
Use less fertilizer and water.",How to Keep Landscape Grasses from Spreading2,"


In early spring burn or cut off the dried grass leaves from the previous season if you did not do it in the fall.
Wait for new grass shoots to begin growing.
When the new shoots are still small dig around the whole clump of grass.
Spread a tarp or sheet of plastic on the ground.
Lift the clump of grass and place it on the tarp or plastic.
Using a pruning saw or a chain saw simply cut the grass root clump into chunks. You can quarter it or make more or less cuts depending on the size of the root system.
Replant what you want of the smaller root pieces and give the rest away.
Discard the center of the old root system if it has no new grass shoots growing from it. Some clumps die out in the center.

,


Grasses won’t grow as much if you skip the fertilizer and water only when it’s very dry.
If the plant’s growth yellows or looks spindly you may need to resume watering and fertilizer.

Spread your seeds.,
Top-dress your soil.,
Water your seeds.,
Mow your new lawn.",How to Grow a Lawn Easily2," Set your seed spreader to the recommended rate and fill it with half of your seeds. To ensure the best coverage, make the first pass in one direction over the entire lawn. Then, fill the spreader up with the remaining seed and cross over the initial direction. Think of making a crisscross pattern over the area.








You may choose to cover the entire area again with an empty spreader to ensure good seed to soil contact., Once you've seeded the entire area, add some peat moss to your soil to set the seeds and help them hold moisture. Using a cage roller, apply a thin layer of peat moss to your seeds.








This layer of mulch will help keep your seeds moist during germination. It may also protect them from birds and limit their movement in the event of heavy rain.You can also spread your top-dressing by tossing it lightly over the seeded area with a shovel. Use a rake with the tines facing up to smooth down the top-dressing and ensure that the seeds are well covered and in contact with the soil.

, Perhaps the best way to water is with an oscillating sprinkler. If you have access to multiple sprinklers set them up in various parts of your yard to wet the entire area.








For best results, water your seeds 2-3 times a day for about 5-10 minutes for the first 8-10 days. During this period it is critical that your seeds stay moist. You don't want to over water the seeds, but you do want to encourage germination. Water in the morning to decrease the chances of evaporation.Don't use a strong spray when watering a newly seeded lawn. You run the risk of drowning your seeds or washing them away.When watering your lawn, be aware of any potential rainfall in your area. Take the amount of rain into consideration when watering and aim for about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water a week.If you live in an area prone to heavy rainfall, you could lose some seed. However, the rain must be heavy enough to move the soil before it can move the seed., When the grass reaches about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) it's time to mow. Make sure the soil is dry when you mow; if it's wet you could pull the grass out of the ground."

Buy your sod.,
Get your sod on the same day you plan to install it.,
Lay the first row.,
Keep the sod tight.,
Water as you go.,
Fill in the gaps.,
Use a lawn roller to pack down your sod.,
Give your sod a final watering.",How to Grow a Lawn Easily3," Growing a lawn from sod is much more expensive than growing from seed, but much faster. Sod, which comes in rolls, is grass that has been grown for a little over a year. The roots hold the strips together allowing you to put long strips onto your prepared soil.Sod is typically sold on heavy wooden pallets, ranging in size from 450-700 sq. ft (42-65 sq. m). These pallets are difficult to transport, so you may wish to ask your supplier about delivery services and fees. You will probably need to pay a return deposit on your sod.
You can plant sod in almost any season, but if you plan on laying sod in the summer, make sure you give it plenty of water., Sod begins to spoil and die quickly when left on the pallet, so plan to install it on the day of purchase, and only purchase as much as you can install in a single day. Lightly water the sod, cover it with burlap, and keep it in a shaded area until you are ready to use it.

Keep the sod moist and cool while you work with it. Keep a spray bottle handy to keep it from drying out., Start laying your sod along the longest straight edge in your yard, usually by a fence line or a driveway. Don't walk on the sod while you're laying it and if you do happen to step on it, smooth out the footprints with a rake.Trim any excess sod off with a sharp knife and save it for odd corners.Make sure the sod is smooth as you lay it. You want it flat against the soil so the roots will take., As you start laying the sod, avoid any gaps between pieces. The sod should be snug near hard surfaces, such as pavement or bricks, so that the edges don't dry out.Cut off half of the second piece of sod when you lay it. In doing so, you will create staggered seams, much like brick-work. This will make the seams less noticeable and keep the edges from drying out., New sod needs to stay moist. Once you've put the first few rows down, give your sod a good watering. Take a break to check the moisture every few rows or so.Pay special attention to the edges as they can dry out fast.You can backfill with some top-dressing material or add topsoil along the edges of each row as you work to help retain moisture.

, While it's best to keep the pieces of sod tight against each other, you may still find some gaps. Rather than use small pieces of sod which will dry out too fast, fill the gaps in with potting soil or peat moss., Once you have laid out your rows of sod, go over them with a lawn roller filled at to least ¾ capacity with water or sand. This will flatten out your sod and pack it firmly into the soil base., Once you've finished laying the last of the sod, soak your lawn.Water your sod until the soil beneath is soaking wet. Not only will this allow the roots to take quicker, it will ensure the sod is too wet to walk on.However, avoid watering your sod to the point of creating puddles. This can cause the sod to separate from the soil.
Avoid heavy traffic for the first two weeks as it could disturb the sod and prevent solid roots from forming. After about two weeks, it will be safe to mow."

Look for patches of grass that appear out of place.,
Examine the blades.,
Examine the stems.,
Carefully dig down to the root of the nutgrass.",How to Get Rid of Nutgrass1," Nutgrass generally grows taller and looks lighter than the rest of your grass. Since it is similar to other grass varieties, small patches can be difficult to notice unless you are specifically looking for them.;
, Kneel on the ground and look at the shape and thickness of the grass blades growing in out of place patches. Nutgrass has thick, stiff blades that shoot up from stems in sets of three. Most normal varieties of grass have two blades that shoot up from a single stem.

, Break a stem of potential nutgrass off and look at the broken end. Nutgrass has a triangular stem with a solid center, while most normal grasses have rounded stems. Many normal grasses are also more hollow inside than they are solid.

, If you suspect that you have nutgrass based on the appearance of the upper half of the plant, you can either proceed to remove the grass immediately or you can dig down to the root to confirm your suspicions before taking further action. Use a garden trowel to cautiously dig beside the patch of grass and look for any nut-shaped nodules at the root. You may need to dig as deep as 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 centimeters).

",How to Grow Monkey Grass from Seed," These blossoms usually arrive in late summer or early fall.


Clip the blossom stems that hold the seeds. Dry the stems by hanging them in a room with good circulation.
Pull the seeds from the stem by hand. They should fall off fairly easily.
If you get monkey grass from a landscape or garden supplier, make sure the seeds are fresh. Monkey grass will not store for longer than 2 weeks, without losing its capacity to germinate. They should be stored in wet or humid conditions.;
, Choose a time when there will be some sun, but not much rain. Monkey grass seeds are easily washed away.


If you live in colder, northern climates, you will have a better chance of germination if you buy seeds and plant in the early spring.

,, Weeds compete for the same soil nutrients that the grass will need to germinate and grow.


The type of weeds will vary widely depending upon your location. Weeding can be done with a rake and by hand with smaller or deeply rooted weeds.

, Use a tiller to combine the compost into the soil. You can also use fertilizers with urea, ammonia and sulfate to add acid to the soil.

,, They should be 8 to 12 inches (20.3 to 30.5 cm) deep, if you want to contain monkey grass. Most varietals of monkey grass are aggressive and they will take over surrounding areas if dividers aren't used.

, The amount you need will depend upon the area you want to fill. You will need to plant the seeds in 3 different areas, so divide your seeds into 3 equal groups.

, Sprinkle a third of the seeds into the soil in this direction.

,,,, It should be moist while the seeds germinate. Seeds should sprout within 1 month.

Choose a sunny location.",How to Grow a Clover Lawn," You can grow clover on soil, or you can overseed it on an established lawn. Either way, you need to get the area ready for the clover, so that it has a chance to establish itself.For a lawn, cut the lawn as short as you can. Rake the lawn with a thatch rake to help remove some of the excess grass.
For soil, till it up about a month ahead of planting, and remove as much green as you can. Smooth out the area, and then start watering it. This process will make the weeds sprout up. Cut them down in about two weeks. Now you can start with a relatively weed-free area for the clover.;
, To help you spread the seed more evenly, you need to stir in some sand or soil. Mix about equal parts of seed and sand or soil. The seed is small, so the mixture helps you spread the seed all across your lawn instead of using it up in one area.It doesn't really matter what kind of soil or sand you use. Playground sand works fine. It may be best to use something that's not fertilized, as fertilized soil may increase the chance of other weeds growing.
Consider adding a clover inoculant to the mixture. An inoculant encourages the clover to form a relationship with the bacteria in the soil so that it can produce its own nitrogen., Use your hand to spread the seed evenly over the lawn. If you have a large lawn, you can use a broadcast spreader, which you can buy at local garden stores and home improvement stores., The seeds need to stay moist while they are sprouting. Water them at least once a day and twice a day if it's particularly hot. You'll need to water them this frequently for about two weeks, until they sprout and begin to grow well., Clover can produce nitrogen all on its own, as long as it forms the proper relationship with the soil (which you encourage by adding a clover inoculant when planting). Adding in fertilizer will usually encourage grasses and weeds to grow instead of the clover., Clover seeds will do best if they don’t have to compete with weeds while they're establishing. To remove all vegetation, rocks, and debris from the area, till or rake the soil to a depth of about eight inches (20 cm).Tilling a month in advance will give any weeds time to regrow so you can remove them before planting.
Tilling now will also make it easier to change the soil if the pH needs to be adjusted.

, Clover will grow in most soils, but it grows best in sandy loam and clay. It also thrives best when the soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.0. If your soil is too rich, too acidic, or too alkaline, you should change the soil to make it more suitable.Add sand to correct soil that’s too rich (not sandy enough).
Add lime to correct soil that’s too acidic (a low pH). You'll likely need to do this in the soil around coniferous trees.
Till in peat moss or sawdust to correct soil that’s too alkaline (a high pH).
You can buy a kit to check the pH of your soil at gardening centers.

, To encourage latent weeds and vegetation to grow, provide the tilled area with a light misting of water every day. This process will help you eliminate weeds in a couple weeks, right before planting the clover seeds.


You don’t have to worry about watering if you're getting sufficient rain during this time.

, A couple days before planting, use a spade or small shovel to dig up any weeds that have sprouted up since you tilled the land. This will kill competition and give the clover the best possible chance of thriving.You can also use a scythe to cut them out.

, Clover seeds are very small and lightweight. To ensure they spread evenly, it’s best to mix them with another medium that will make them easier to distribute on the ground. Right before planting, transfer the seeds to a bucket and mix them with equal parts of one of the following:Soil
San
Sawdust

, Transfer the seed and medium mixture to a seed spreader. Open the flow lever and walk at a normal pace in rows, up and down the area you want to seed.


You can spread the seeds by hand if your lawn is very small, but a seed spreader will be much faster and provide more even coverage over a larger area.

, Clover seeds will not grow if they are buried in the ground, but covering them with a thin layer of soil will help to keep them in place and prevent wind or predators from disturbing them. Go over the area you’ve seeded with a rake and gently mix the seeds into the top layer of soil.


Do not rake more than a quarter-inch (6 mm) deep, otherwise the seeds won’t grow.

, Water the seeds immediately after spreading them. This process will help the seeds stick in the ground and encourage germination. Provide the seeds with a light misting of water every day that it doesn’t rain until the seedlings grow leaves.


During the spring, summer, and warmer fall months, make sure the clover gets about 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5 cm) of water per week.When planted during the warmer spring or summer months, clover seeds will germinate in one to two weeks.

, You can purchase clover seeds at garden stores, at most home and hardware stores, and online. You'll need roughly 2 ounces (57 g) of clover seeds per 1,000 square feet of lawn.The most popular types of clovers for lawns are Dutch White (a perennial that grows to 8 inches or 20 centimeters and Microclover (a durable clover that has small leaves and short stems).Inoculated clover seeds of any variety are also popular, because it means you don’t have to inoculate them yourself. Inoculation is the process of coating the seeds with a nitrogen-fixing bacterium that allows the clover to produce its own nitrogen. Be sure to store these seeds in a cool, dark place.

, The best time to plant clover is in spring or summer. To plant in spring, make sure the last frost has occurred, and that nighttime temperatures are staying above 40 F (4 C). The best time to seed clover is between mid-March and mid-August.


In warmer areas, you can plant clover in September and October, but plant it at least six weeks before the first frost.
In the warmest areas where winters are mild and there's rarely snow or freezing temperatures in winter, you can plant clover all year round., Depending on the size of your lawn, you may have conditions that vary greatly from one area to another, so some areas may not be ideal for clover. Clover is very hardy and will even grow in partial shade, but it will do best when it gets between four and six hours of sunlight per day.


Where possible, prune and trim trees, hedges, and brush to ensure the clover gets enough light."

, Feed the SOIL. Many companies will put extra fertilizer on your lawn to give it a dark or a quick green. This is harmful to your lawn. It will disturb the balance of the soil and although it may look good, it has harmful effects and will damage the grass and come back to bite you in the end. Use organic fertilizers that feed the soil and the micro-organisms and microbes. This helps your lawn to develop naturally and healthier.

Slip on a pair of gardening gloves.,
Insert a gardening trowel directly next to the nut grass.,
Gently pry the nut grass, roots and all, out of the ground.,
Dig out any stray roots.,
Put the weeds into a garbage bag, along with the soil you dug out simultaneously.",How to Get Rid of Nutgrass2," You will need to dig into the dirt quite a bit using this method, and gardening gloves should reduce the amount of dirt you get on your skin and under your nails.

, Dig down as far as you can go. Nut grass root systems can extend as deep down as 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 centimeters) below the surface.

, Doing this gently is vital to reduce the number of roots that break off, as well as the number of pieces those roots break into.

, If any roots remain, there is still some chance that the nut grass can return.

, Dispose of the weeds in your trash. Do not throw them into a pile or into a compost heap, since you may end up spreading them into another area of your lawn by doing so.

"
Perform this procedure in spring.,
Use a hose to water the lawn.,
Sift sugar over your lawn in straight lines.,
Spray the lawn once more using a hose.,
Repeat this procedure at least twice more throughout the spring.",How to Get Rid of Nutgrass3," It proves most effective at the start of the growing season, when nut grass is just barely beginning to germinate and sprout.

, You do not need to soak it, but the lawn should be evenly moist down to the soil.

, Walk up and down the lawn in straight lines and at a steady pace. Pour the sugar through a sifter as you walk, continually turning the handle of the sifter the make sure that the sugar falls on the grass in even amounts.


This is no mere folk remedy. Sugar actually ""eats"" the nut grass while nourishing microbes that have a positive effect on your lawn.

, Do not saturate the grass, since doing so will wash the sugar away. Spray the lawn with a light mist, providing just enough water to re-moisten the blades of grass and coax the sugar down into the soil and the roots of the lawn.

, The nut grass may not die off completely after the first treatment, but after a couple more, all of it should be dead.

"
"
Use herbicide before the nut grass develops five true leaves.,
Select an appropriate herbicide.,
Allow the grass to grow for a few days prior to application.,
Apply the herbicide during a dry period.,
Read the instructions on the label of your herbicide bottle to determine how to apply it properly.,
Repeat the treatment several times during the growing season.",How to Get Rid of Nutgrass4," Leafy nut grass has too many obstacles, preventing herbicides from sliding down to the ""nuts"" and the root. Herbicides work best early in the season, while nut grass is still young and has minimal leaves.

, Products that contain MSMA or products with a chemical called bentazon work best. Nut grass is a common enough problem, so typically speaking, herbicides that work against the weed will be labeled as ""nut grass killers.""

, The herbicide works best when the weed is growing vigorously, and may not be as effective if applied immediately after cutting the weed down. Wait two or more days after your last lawn mowing before applying the chemical to the lawn.

, Wait several days after your last watering, and do not spray the herbicide if you may get rain four hours after application or if you expect heavy rains to follow in coming days. Water will wash the chemical away, and it may not have the chance to do its job before that happens.

, You will usually spray diluted MSMA herbicide over your entire lawn. For instance, the instructions may tell you to mix 1.5 ounces (45 milliliters) of chemical into 5 gallons (20 liters) of water to treat 1000 square feet (92.9 square meters) of lawn.

, Warm season grass may only require two applications, but cool season grass may need four to eight applications before the nut grass dies off completely.

Mow the dandelions as they emerge.,
Dig the dandelions out at the root.,
Smother the weeds.,
Improve your soil.,
Raise chickens or rabbits.,
Use a weed burner torch.,
Pour boiling water over the dandelions.,
Spray the dandelions with vinegar.,
Spread corn gluten meal over the lawn before dandelions germinate.,
Salt the dandelions.,
Use muriatic acid.,
Try a chemical herbicide.",How to Get Rid of Dandelions in a Lawn," As long as you catch the yellow blossoms before they mature into white seeds, you should be able to stop the weed from spreading. Set the lawn mower deck to prevent it from cutting the grass lower than 2 to 2.5 inches (5.08 to 6.34 centimeters), since longer grass will block out the sunlight needed for dandelions to grow.


Note, however, that merely mowing down the top of the flower will not permanently kill the original flower.;
, Removing the dandelion by its root will remove it from your lawn. There are several ""dandelion diggers"" you can purchase at garden and hardware stores to accomplish this task. Some look fork-like in nature, while others look like a hybrid between a screwdriver and a fishtail. In both cases, however, you merely dig around the base of the flower and use leverage to pivot the flower out of the ground, root and all.

, Dandelions require plenty of sunlight to live. You can cover them with cardboard or black plastic bags to block the sunlight out, and within a few days, the flowers should die.

, Add nutrient-rich compost and mulch to the soil to improve its quality. Dandelions thrive on acidic soils and tend to grow weaker in rich soils, making them easier to pull up and less likely to ever take root.

, Both creatures love the taste of dandelions and will munch on the nasty weeds as they pop up from out of the ground. Dandelions are also healthy and nutritious for these animals.

, If you consistently pour boiling water over each dandelion a few times each day, the plants should start to wilt and wither into oblivion within three days.

, Plain white vinegar works, but you can also boil it down to concentrate the amount of acetic acid, creating an even more potent weed killer. Put the vinegar in a spray bottle, and douse the offending weed from head to base.


For even more effective results, pull the dandelion out at the root and spray the hole to kill any roots that got left behind.

, CGM is a pre-emergent herbicide, so it prevents seedlings from ever taking root. Spread the CGM over your lawn four to six weeks before the weeds usually germinate. Since it only lasts for five to six weeks, you should reapply the herbicide multiple times throughout the growing season.

, Pile 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) of salt at the base of the dandelion, where it emerges from the lawn. Avoid getting the salt on other plants, though, since salt has been known to kill plenty of other greenery, too

, Buy some muriatic acid at the hardware store. (It's cheap, around $6 for a gallon and will last an eternity). Put on latex gloves. Use a turkey baster to apply the concentrated acid to the dandelions. Avoid breathing the fumes. Smile as the dandelions turn brown within minutes and stay dead for good.

, A post-emergence herbicide designed to take care of broad leaf weeds is ideal. Systemic weed-killer, like those made with glyphosate, should be applied directly to the weed you want to get rid of. Do not apply these products to your entire lawn. Glyphosate products kill all vegetation and should only be applied directly to the leaves of the dandelion. After the greens die, the chemical will seep into the plant and kill the roots.

Find an active tunnel.,
Use a mole specific trap.,
Gas the moles.,
Trick the moles with bait.,
Use a mouse trap.,
Call a professional pest control service.",How to Get Rid of Moles in Your Lawn1," If you are going to rid your yard, you'll need to learn which tunnels these moles use. Cover the nearest molehill to you and wait a day or two. If the molehill has been uncovered then there's a good chance that the mole is actively using it.;
, These traps tend to be the most effective method of ridding your yard from moles. You can purchase these traps online or at your nearest hardware/home center. These will typically be spring loaded traps that will require you to assemble and set up in an active tunnel. Look into these popular types of mole traps:


Lure traps. This style of trap is an easy and quick one to set up. Set up the trap by placing it firmly in the middle of a tunnel. You won't need to dig anything up, but instead, shove it into a tunnel using your shoe.
Circular rodent traps. These types of traps are more economical and can work for gophers and rats as well. For this trap you'll need to dig up the mound carefully. Then place the trap into the mound and seal any cracks that release light with dirt.
Loop choking style traps. This type of trap probably requires the most work, but the community suggest it is very effective once you get the hang of it. You'll need to cut two slots into an active tunnel. The trap is then lowered into the tunnel in a way that the choker loop is ready to catch unwanted moles., Unless you are a trained professional, you should not use any type of gassing agent other than dry ice. You should also avoid using anything that becomes poisonous when it comes into contact with water. These can be very dangerous, and even fatal.









If you do decide to use a gassing agent, you'll need to be extremely careful. If you successfully gas a major nest or repeat gassing them, you should have positive results. You can find different types of gas solutions, such as ""Revenge Rodent Smoke Bombs"" or ""Whole Control"".If you have children or pets, take precautionary steps to ensure they are not exposed to the gas.

, Lots of traps don't require bait, but you can always better your chances by luring the mole to you. Some baits are poisonous to the mole. Other baits you could acquire easier like earthworms. You could catch earthworms yourself by overturning clumps of your yard, or simply buy them online from amazon.com.








, Mice and moles are about the same size, so mousetraps can be effective for capturing moles. Prepare a piece of bait when setting up the trap. Then, place the mousetrap at the opening of a mole tunnel. Check back on the trap several hours later to see if it has captured any moles.









If nothing's been caught, it's possible the trap was not concealed well enough, or the moles have moved to a new tunnel.

, Sometimes solving your mole problem is best left up to the professionals. They will rid your lawn of moles without you having to worry which method is safest. There are plenty of pest control services in your area.

Plant vegetative barriers.,
Create your own mole repellant.,
Attract mole predators.,
Trap the mole using shovels.",How to Get Rid of Moles in Your Lawn2," Certain plants can deter moles from occupying your lawn. You can plant plants like daffodils, marigolds, alliums, and fritillarias.Castor bean plants are also a known mole deterrent, but they are also poisonous.

, You can create a mixture using castor oil, which can be found in most health sections of your grocery store, and dish soap. Mix 6 ounces of castor oil with 2 tablespoons of dish soap in one gallon of water to create a concentrate. Apply to the lawn periodically, and be sure to reapply after it rains.







, This can be an effective, hands off solution. Owls are natural predators to moles and you can attract them to your yard by building or buying a nest box. Nest boxes look like large bird house that attaches to a tree high off the ground. Once you assemble the nest box, set it up high in a tree and fill it with straw. It's only a matter of time before an owl is attracted to it., This will require a lot of time waiting around from you. First, pat down the mole trail by walking over it. This will allow you to notice when the mole is actively using the tunnel. Wait nearby for the mole to begin moving around. When you notice the mole, enclose this section of the trail off with two shovels. This will trap the mole. Throw a trashcan or a large bucket over the trapped mole, and then scoop it up and transport it away from your lawn.








Keep in mind that this method is probably the least effective option. Try other methods first.

Identify signs of moles.,
Keep your lawn in good condition.,
Add simple components to your lawn.,
Fill the abandoned tunnel with rocks.",How to Get Rid of Moles in Your Lawn3," Sometimes people will easily mistake a gopher to a mole. The biggest difference with gophers is they don't kill your grass., Keeping your grass cut will help you to easily see the signs of a mole. Also, avoid your lawn from getting too soggy. This can be challenging if your lawn is prone to this, but moles are drawn towards wet earth, so avoid over-watering your lawn.








, Put dry ice in their tunnels. The carbon dioxide it emits will suffocate the moles. Put garden wind spinners along their trails and at their entrance holes. They cause the ground to vibrate and moles won't like it, causing them to move on to a more ""peaceful"" location.








, Moles dislike digging through rocks, so it could be a good preventative measure to fill their tunnels. Other moles could occupy the abandoned tunnels, but they'll be less inclined if you use rocks.

Prevent crabgrass from growing in the first place with pre-emergent herbicides.,

Resist picking mature crabgrass.,
Spray postemergence herbicide on larger patches of crabgrass that have not yet gone to seed.,
Let your lawn gulp, not sip.,
Mow your lawn at least weekly.,
Use fertilizers without too much nitrogen in them.,
Aerate your soil to loosen compaction.,
Overseed.,
Clear out all dead crabgrass.",How to Get Rid of Crabgrass," Pre-emergent herbicides act by forming a chemical layer at the surface of the soil.As crabgrass seeds germinate, they take in the herbicide, which prevents them from sprouting and ultimately kills them.;
, This should coincide with the blooming of the forsythia. Buy an inexpensive soil thermometer if you don't know when to time your herbicide application.


Always apply the herbicide along with a starter fertilizer. Fertilizer helps thicken the turf, which in turn snuffs out crabgrass seeds that weren't killed by the fertilizer. Apply a starter fertilizer along with your herbicide and your getting more bang for your buck.

, As small as the print is, you will find valuable information on time of application and safety precautions. Look for herbicides that use the following active ingredients: dithiopyr, prodiamine or pendimethalin.

, The herbicide that you use to snuff out unwanted crabgrass is the same stuff that will lay waste to the soft, pretty grass you actually want to cultivate. That means you have to seed during one season and use herbicide during another: Seed during the early fall and use herbicide during the spring, making sure to keep a buffer of at least 50 days in between.

, These will kill your grass as well so only use if you have more crabgrass than lawn or thick patches of it.

, Crabgrass spreads quickly. If you let it grow for a whole season, or if you miss a particular area, you could find yourself with an infestation. Whenever you see a bit of crabgrass, simply pluck it out by hand.


Picking crabgrass at a young age is effective at reigning the total population in. Young crabgrass has only two to four stalks and is showing no splayed head.
If plucking, water the area with the crabgrass thoroughly beforehand. This loosens up the soil and increases your chances of pulling out all the root systems when plucking. Alternatively, you can also use a pair of pliers to grab and gently pull up the crabgrass., Mulching after removing the crabgrass by hand gives you a better shot at preventing the crabgrass roots from taking seed and growing willy-nilly all over again. What you're doing is creating another barrier that the crabgrass needs to break through.


Areas left thin and spotty after pulling up the crabgrass can be re-seeded in the mulch by using seeds that match your current type of grass or turf.

, Mature crabgrass has splayed seed heads with dozens, if not hundreds of seeds. Picking this crabgrass creates a divot in your lawn into which as many as 5,000 seeds — coming from a single plant — can fall.


Instead of picking mature crabgrass, spray it or let it die naturally in the fall. Then cover the area with pre-emergent herbicide in the spring to keep the seeds from sprouting.

, Postemergence herbicide takes about 2 weeks to fully work, which is roughly the same amount of time it can take for a seeding crabgrass plant to drop its seeds, nullifying the effect of the herbicide.


Apply postemergence herbicide on a warm day with little or no wind.
For best results, use the herbicide when the soil is damp but the crabgrass itself is dry. Water the area thoroughly in the late morning and wait until afternoon to spray. Apply moderately in two spread-out application to avoid hurting your turf.
Get prepared to spray at least two rounds of herbicide — per instruction, of course — unless the crabgrass is very young.

, Give your lawn a thorough watering about once a week — a big, nice gulp. This gulp, as opposed to frequent sips, will promote a more robust root system as well as one that's more heat tolerant.

, Frequent (semiweekly) mowing cuts down as much as 80% of weed growth across all species.If you don't have the time to mow twice a week, mow once a week and leave the trimmings over the lawn to act as fertilizer. The trimmings will make it harder for crabgrass to sprout.


If there are areas where the crab grass is laying down, use a rake to pull it be before mowing. This helps remove immature seed heads.

, ""Quick-up"" fertilizers are a temporary solution; they'll get your lawn growing nice and green in the short term, but in the long term they actually deprive your lawn of nutrients, making the entrance for crabgrass easier. Use only about 2 to 4 pounds of nitrogen per 1,000 sq feet of lawn, depending on your lawn., If your soil is suffering from compaction, the too-compact soil is cutting off circulation (air and water) to the root systems of your normal grass. Under these conditions, crabgrass and other forms of weeds thrive. Run an aerator over your lawn every season if you suspect it's too compact, especially if your soil contains high levels of clay.

, Overseed your lawn to promote the right sort of growth. While you only have to overseed patches where crabgrass thrive, it might be helpful to overseed your entire lawn every two or three seasons., Dead crabgrass can have an allelopathic effect, meaning it releases a toxin that stops other nearby plant growth. Completely remove any dead crabgrass plants from your lawn and dispose of them well away from your turf."

,
Pack the moving truck so that all of your furniture is secure and not in danger of getting damaged or damaging other pieces.",How to Pack Furniture For Moving," This will give you a written inventory and help you determine how much packing material you need.;
, Things you will need for furniture will include sofa and mattress covers, packing tape, bubble wrap, plastic wrap, sheets of cardboard, furniture blankets and old towels and rags.


Speak with salespeople at moving supply stores. Explain the type of furniture you will be packing up, and ask for recommendations on what you will need. On moving day, you will find you are much better off to have too much than not enough.

, Dust and polish everything you plan to move. It makes no sense to pack up dirty furniture and bringing it into your new home, and you will not want to spend time cleaning it once you move.

, This will make it lighter and easier to transport.


Empty all dresser drawers. Remove anything in china cabinets, bookshelves, entertainment centers and other furniture pieces. Those items inside your furniture should be packed separately.

, For example, remove legs from sofas and tables, take out dining table leafs and remove the headboards and footboards from beds.


Check any manuals or materials you may have for your furniture. These booklets or pamphlets should contain instructions on how to properly take the furniture apart.

, Label the bags so you know what they are and what the pieces belong to. For example, your bags might read ""nuts and bolts from kitchen table"" or ""bed screws.""


Tape the bags to the corresponding furniture if that will help you keep everything together. Some people prefer to pack them away together, and others use masking or packing tape to attach the bags of hardware.

, Use bubble wrap, stretchable plastic wrap, towels and blankets to protect table legs, bed rails and other detached pieces to your furniture.


Securely tape or tie the bubble wrap, plastic or other materials. You want to make sure no part of your furniture pieces becomes exposed during transit.
Label the boxes clearly. For example, a box might say ""dining room table legs,"" ""drawers from kids' bedroom"" or ""desk shelving.""

, You can also use thick furniture blankets or towels.


Place your glass pieces in telescoping boxes. These are boxes that fit inside one another, offering extra support to heavy things such as glass. Add newspapers, rags or other packing materials to the boxes to ensure the glass does not have room to move.

, These covers will protect your furniture against rips, damage and moisture.


Purchase these covers at moving supply stores such as U-Haul, or online through discount retailers like Amazon and Ecobox.

,, Similarly weighted objects should go on each side of the truck to keep everything balanced.


Take advantage of any hooks or paneling inside the moving truck to keep everything steady.

Sort through all of your stuff first.,
Find some boxes.,
Get some tools.,
Set aside items you'll need immediately.,
Separate out really important or valuable items.,
Start organizing.,
Pack delicate items cleverly to keep them from breaking.,
Make good use of space.,
Stay focused and motivated.,
Load it up!",How to Pack Like a Pro1," Start your moving process by getting rid of the items that you don't need. There's no sense in organizing and trying to pack a bunch of stuff that you'll just get rid of anyway, so pick through your home meticulously and get rid of as much as you can. Go room by room and look for items that you haven't used at all in the last year. Chances are, if more than a year goes by without use, you probably don't need the item.


Everyone has sentimental knickknacks and old papers that they don't want to get rid of. That's fine. But a healthy practice is to keep a small or medium size box that's devoted to these items. Keep only what you can fit in the box. If you want to put in things that are new, you have to empty out things that don't matter to you quite as much any more. This practice will keep you from hoarding items.;
, Next you'll want to get some boxes to pack items in to. You might want to use plastic bins for some items, like papers and clothes, which are sensitive to water and staining. This will keep them from getting damaged. For most other items however, cardboard boxes are the way to go. Use mainly small and medium size boxes and pack them no heavier than 50 lbs.


You can often buy cheap cardboard boxes from auto shops and hardware stores. Avoid the boxes sold by moving companies, as they are often more expensive.
You can also get boxes for free, although they might not be in as good condition. Go to grocery stores, wholesale stores, large cafeterias or restaurants, and liquor stores and ask if they have any boxes you can have for moving. Since they have to take the cardboard to the recycling anyway, they're usually happy to give the boxes away. Liquor store boxes are best for moving, since they're designed to carry very heavy items without breaking.

, You will want to rent a few items from your local hardware store or moving company, in order to make this process easier and less back-breaking. Mainly, you'll want a hand truck and possibly a dolly. These will help you transport very heavy items and more than one item at once, speeding up the process and making it easier on your body.


Of course, you'll want other items too. Tape, shrink wrap, pens for labeling, scissors, box cutters, twine and cords are all very useful for packing and moving.

, Make a separate box or bag with all the things that you'll need for the first few days after moving. Put things inside like a few changes of clothes, your toiletries, a roll of toilet paper, a few plates and utensils, and maybe a frying pan. This will save you from having to dig through a bunch of boxes right away to get at the things you need most.


Remember to tape the lids closed on liquid items and wrap them in bags. You don't want all of your immediately needed items to be covered in shampoo.

, For items that are really important, like all of your moving documents and important documents like birth certificates, you will want to have a separate box or bag. You should also put very expensive items in this box, like your mp3 player and your grandmother's jewelry. This box should be transported in your car with you or on your person.


If you're moving very far, it might be a good idea to have this box shipped ahead of you. Send it to your new home if someone is waiting there to receive it or have it shipped to someone you trust.

, Now that you've got all that done, you can start going through the rest of the items in your home. Go room by room and try to keep similar items together. Place heavier items at the bottom of boxes and try to evenly distribute the weight between boxes. Make sure the box is full and if it's not, fill it with packing paper. If the top of the box has nothing below it, it will be more prone to collapsing, which can break the items in your box. As you pack, be sure to label everything clearly.


Make an inventory list as you go, numbering the boxes and indicating which important items are in which boxes (as well as how many boxes there are). You can also use color-coded tape to indicate which room boxes belong in, for example making all boxes for the living room green and all boxes for the kitchen yellow.

, You're probably acquainted with the idea of wrapping delicate items in newspaper or bubble wrap. These are both very good practices and you should definitely wrap items which are prone to breaking. However, you should consider also using non traditional items, since sometimes these can be doubled up to save you packing space.


For example, wrap your glasses in pairs of clean socks and your picture frames can be wrapped in towels.
You should also remember to wrap items to support them. Items with holes at the center or long arms should be wrapped to give them support and make them look more like solid objects. This will keep them from getting broken.
Make sure any boxes that do contain delicate items are marked as fragile. This will help you decide how to organize boxes in the truck and keep you from accidentally breaking items.

, Look for any place where there is empty space and use it for packing space. This can reduce the overall footprint of your move, saving you money on trucks or containers. Large furniture items are usually the best example of spaces that can be multipurpose.


For example, you can stuff linens in your fridge. Your dresser drawers can filled with rolled up clothes and saran wrapped individually. Since the drawers are best carried in to your new home one at a time anyway, you can use the space so that the dresser space isn't wasted when it's in the truck.

, Most importantly, you're going to want to stay focused and motivated. Even the most fastidious packer can move at a snail's pace if they get bored and distracted. Pack with other people, making it a social gathering. If you can't do that, at least put on your favorite movie or an energetic soundtrack. This will help keep you on task.


Start with the most difficult items to pack. This means that by the end, when you're getting tired, you'll be able to knock out the easy items just like that.

, Once you’re done packing, load the boxes and items into a truck or other transportation method for getting them to their final destination. Put the tools, like the hand truck, that you got to good use and be sure to strap everything down. You may also want to wrap large items, like bed headboards and dressers, in blankets, in order to keep them from getting scratched by boxes.

Divide your clothes based on purpose.",How to Pack Clothes for Moving," Often times over the years clothes can become piled up without you even realizing it. The first step to sort this all out is to get all of your clothes out from your dresser, closet, attic, and below your bed. Lay everything out, either across your floor, or on top of your bed. Begin to pair things together, based on color, size, and fabric.Once you have started to make categories, place each of your articles in select piles.
Begin to match box and suitcase sizes. If you have a relatively small pile of specific articles, you can pair that pile with a smaller box. Some of the larger piles might have to be matched with a suitcase or larger box.;
, This is the perfect time to try on some of the old in your closet that you haven't worn in ten years. Check the clothes for mildew, moth balls, flees, bedbugs, etc. Smell them to see if they have a musty scent. Determine whether or not they are outdated. After you search through your closet/cupboard, you should have a pile of outdated, outgrown, and worn out clothes to throw away.Run your fingernail overtop of the fabric. This will help loosen any bugs, or bedbug fecal matter (dried blood) which is present on your clothes. It is best to dispose of these clothes, especially if they are old and haven't been worn in a while.
Donate clothing that is still in good shape and does not fit you or is not appropriate for the climate in your new home. Many people like to take clothes to Goodwill or homeless shelters.
Throw out clothing that is torn, stained or too worn to wear in public. This is especially true when it comes to any old underwear and socks which have been crammed in your dresser drawer for many years.

, You will probably not finish all of your unpacking on the first day of your move, so keep a small bag with a few changes of clothes that you can use when you first arrive at your new home. Remember to leave out an outfit for moving day as well, and include undergarments and socks.Pack the items you need upon arrival to your new home in a separate container. This could include not just clothes, but also toothbrushes, deodorant, hairspray, etc.

, When you move, chances are you will have to move glassware, dishes, etc. Wrap these items in some of those clothes you were going to throw away. Find specific items which fit the shape and size of what you want to wrap. If there are elongated items you can place them in pants legs. If it is a wide plate you wish to wrap, place it in the body of a shirt.Carefully stack these items on top of one another, or side-to-side. Do not throw the items down and break them.
You can also add extra layers of old clothes in between the items when you start packing them up. Add a shirt, or an extra pair of pants, in between the items.
Pack your glasses or stemware in knee high socks.

, If you are taking your dresser with you when you move, you can leave some of the items in the drawers. You should leave lightweight items like underwear, socks, t-shirts, etc., while taking out sweatpants, jeans, coats, etc. You then have the choice of taking your dresser as a whole or breaking it down into its component parts. Get people who are big, or who have upper body strength to move the dresser.If your drawers are generally loose, with no locking mechanism, it it best to remove the drawers. You will want to wrap each of the drawers separately, with a large container of plastic wrap. Go around the drawer in both directions, multiple times. Do this until the drawer has been completely wrapped, and all of the contents are secure.
If you decide to take the dresser as a whole, you will want to secure the drawers. Take a bungee cord and wrap it all the way around the dresser, overtop of one of the drawers. Hook the two ends of the bungee cord. Then take more bungee cords and wrap it around the other drawers, all the way around the dresser.
Safely secure the dresser in the moving van. You can either use bungee cords or lifting straps. Tightly wrap them around your dresser and secure them to the base/side of your truck (on the inside).

, You will want to make sure your folds are neat and tight so that you can fit as many clothes into each of your boxes. The best way to fold them is inside out, that way the creases that ensue will be easier to get out when you unpack. Bundle wrapping is another great option if you don't mind getting your clothes slightly creased.For bundle wrapping, lay out a large piece of clothing on a clean surface like a table. This article of clothing could be a jacket, winter coat, large sweater.
Lay clothes on top of the large article one by one. Start with the next largest size of clothes and work towards the middle, until you are laying down your smallest articles.
Finally, take one end of the largest article on the bottom in your hands. Begin to roll until all of the clothes are wrapped tightly together in one bundle. You can add a scrunchy, or a few rubber bands over the bundle to keep it secure.

, Like books, the weight of clothes can be greatly underestimated. Because of this, it is best to pack your clothes into many smaller boxes rather than a few large boxes. If not, the bottoms can fall out of the boxes, and they can be very hard to carry.When you are purchasing/borrowing boxes to use, try and get 12X12 inch boxes. Any larger than that can be hard to carry.
Lift your boxes occasionally as you pack. This will give you a feel for how heavy they are getting and when to move onto a new box.

, This is probably the cheapest way to move your clothes if you already own suitcases. Simply fold them neatly, placing them one over the other. Try to keep pants/shorts on the bottom of the suitcase, leaving room at the top for shirts and dresses.If you can, use suitcases with wheels. They will be much better to move, both into your moving vehicle, and into your new house.
Be careful not to pack delicate garments tightly in a suitcase. You can either pack them loosely, or use another method of packing. Suitcases are best designed to transport t-shirts, jeans, and shorts, all of which can be ironed later on.

, When you are trying to transport dress shirts, pants, dresses, etc. you need a way to keep them from getting wrinkled. Wardrobe boxes are tall, with handles on both sides, and are equipped with a hanging rack at the top. They allow you to hang your clothes on hangers, thereby not having to fold them. This way you also will have most of your clothes hangers packed as well, and put to good use.Find wardrobe boxes with a metal pole rather than the cardboard ones. Especially if you want to hang a lot of clothes in the box, the metal rack will hold up better over time, and can be reused later.
Wardrobe boxes are rather expensive. If you can, limit their use. Only buy one or two, and only place your most precious articles in them.

, Garbage bags are a cheap, easy way to protect your hanging clothes. Cut a hole at the bottom of a garbage bag with a pair of scissors; one large enough to get hangers through. Slide your clothes on hangers through the hole. Tie the bag in a knot at the bottom of your clothes, and secure the top with a zip-tie.Vacuum sealed bags are another great option. They are found pretty cheaply at most department stores and will provide you with a little extra space as you pack.
Place your clothes in the vacuum sealed bags, either folded or laid flat, depending on the size of your bags. Seal the top of the bag off (usually come with a plastic zipper). Attach the hose of a vacuum cleaner to the bag and suck out the air.
Once the excess air has been eliminated, you will now have fairly thin bags of clothes which can be packed in suitcases or boxes.

, Each of the labels should have: season, size, type (clothes, jackets, coats, undergarments, etc.), who it belongs to, and where it is going in the new house. You can buy pre-made labels for moving, or use some labels from when you last wrapped Christmas packages. Taping a piece of paper onto the box is another great option. Make sure that you use enough tape to secure the label.Completely cover the labels in clear tape. This will protect it from rain damage if your boxes are left out in the rain. You will still be able to see the label clearly.
Write the labels in a dark pen, or a magic marker. This way the label won't rub off in between when it is shipped.

, This will prevent your clothes from getting dirty. Use shoeboxes to pack your shoes if you still have them. You can stack the shoeboxes on top of one another in a larger box.Stuff shoes with socks or paper to ensure they keep their form and do not get crushed if you are packing them without shoeboxes. This will also prevent them from scuffing one another.
Alternate the position of your shoes in the boxes to save space.

, If you are making a short move, there is no need to pack everything. For example, if you are only moving a few streets away, you can lay down your clothing, still on the hangers, in the backseat of your car. You can also be more lenient with how much you take at once. Only take a few boxes over at once. Take the clothes which you won't need anytime soon over to your new house first., Place all of the same types of materials in the same box. Whether it be silks, cottons, polyesters, wools, etc. Each type of fabric needs a different treatment, has a different thickness, and different susceptibilities to creasing. When you get to your new house, it will be much easier to sort out your clothes this way, and prioritize which ones need to come out first.Woolen fabrics are generally thicker, and less susceptible to creasing. To pack away these clothes, fold them like normal, and place them in one over the others. You might want to place a paper towel in between each of them so that they do not tangle and knot together. You might also consider getting a few extra boxes to accommodate the thickness of the fabric.
Silks and cottons are thinner and easily creased. You can fold them and place them into boxes if you don't mind the creases. There is always the option to iron your clothes once you move into your new home. However, if you don't want them to get creased, you can place each of the articles on hangers, and drape a plastic clothing bag over top. Hang them in your moving vehicle when you get ready to move.
Polyesters and other synthetics can be crammed into boxes. They are fairly thin and don't crease easily. Fold them up like any other normal clothes and place them in boxes one on top of the other.

, You will not need those items right away, and you can mark the boxes and bags so that you unpack them last. For instance, if you moving in the beginning of summer, you can pack up your fall sweaters and winter coats from the start. If you are moving in the middle of January, pack away your short sleeve t-shirts and shorts.


If you are packing in one of those in between months, leave some clothes that you might use near the top of the box.Pack away your specialty clothes as well. This includes hiking clothes, swim trunks, etc. Chances are, before a big move, you will not be traveling to use these items.

, In separate boxes pack summer, fall, winter, and spring clothes. Summer and spring clothes are generally lighter, and can be packed tightly together. These clothes are somewhat easier to crease, so you can leave a few special pieces on hangers. However, you need to remain efficient with your space, so choose wisely. Winter and fall clothes are thicker, and less likely to crease. You will need more boxes, but you won't need many hanger if at all.Make sure to label each box. You do not want to have to go searching through every single box to find what you need.
Prioritize certain clothes depending on where you are planning on living. If you are moving up north, pack your winter clothes first. That way when you get there those boxes will be ready for you. If you are moving southward, pack your summer/spring clothes first.

, Place all large items in one box, and smaller items in another. For example, pack your sweaters, jackets, coats, jeans, etc. in one box. Pack underwear, socks, gloves, earmuffs, leggings, etc. into a smaller box. Because you will be mixing and matching here, depending on size, make sure you write a clear label on the outside of your box about the contents.Maintain a list as you are packing to make writing the label that much easier.
Combine this method with other methods. For example, pack together large items which are used solely during winter time. Smaller items which are all silk. This will make it much easier when it comes time to unpack.

, Pack together all of your pants into one box. Gather together all of your underwear and place them in another. Have a separate box for only dress shirts. This method is designed for a quick moving time. If you are planning on having a longer move-in time, it is best to try one of the other methods which allow you to pack a wide array of clothes together in one box."

Pack a separate pouch for the plane.",How to Pack Like a Pro2," You need to know what you can expect once you get to your destination. First of all, if you’re staying with a friend or family member, see what items they have there for you to use (like towels and shampoo). You should also check the weather report for your destination, so you know what kind of clothes to bring.


Make sure to consider what the weather will be like in the evenings and mornings too, not just what you’ll need for daytime wear. Some places are very hot during the day but freezing once the sun goes down.

, You want to pack as light as possible, since toting around a bunch of stuff you don't need will only add to the headache of a trip. By taking only a carry on, you can save yourself some baggage fees, get out of the airport faster, and have less to carry as you make your way to your hotel.


Even if you're going on a trip for a long time, you can still pack lightly. Simply find a laundromat or other way of cleaning your clothes (such as borrowing a friend's clothes or washing them by hand in the hotel's tub).
If you do use this method, keep in mind that you will be limited in the items that you can bring, such as liquids and sharp objects. However, sometimes these items can be purchased once you arrive.

, Try to find as many opportunities as you can to make items count for more than one purpose. Stick to a color scheme when picking your clothes and try to pack three tops for every pair of bottoms. No one will notice that those jeans are the same and you can get vastly different looks by pairing items creatively.For example, for a one week trip, you can pack one pair of pants, three tee shirts, two tank tops, two formal shirts, a button up sweater, and a pair of pajama bottoms. The sweater can not only be paired with the formal shirts for style and the tees for warm, it can also be paired with the two tank tops to act as another casual top. All of the shirts can be worn as pajama tops after their respective days of wear. Between the pair of pants you wear on the plane and the pair you pack, you'll have plenty of clothes for your trip.

, When you choose which clothes items you bring, choose items which can be layered. This will help keep you prepared for whatever the weather works out to be while you're there. You'll also want to go with items that are lightweight, since this will help with the layering but also keep your bag lighter overall.


For example, wear a sweater on the plane and keep your bag packed with lots of light tops that can be worn with the sweater as needed.

, There are many different schools of thought on what the best way to physically pack your clothes is. The truth is that it depends on what you're packing, how much you're taking, and how well you pack it. One good option is to roll your clothes. This uses less space than laying your clothes folded in the bag and can actually prevent wrinkles if you use a nice, tight roll. However, this method only works well if you plan on taking a very full bag.


When you roll items, be sure to keep them as tight as possible and smooth wrinkles as you roll them. This will prevent major creases from forming.

, Lay a tee shirt out flat on your bed. Fold up your underwear and some pajama bottoms into a roughly 10x10"" square and place the square up at the collar of the shirt. Fold the left side of the tee over and then the right so that you have a long triangle going up and down. Now, lay your socks horizontally across the top, central part (where the underwear are). The open end of the socks should be facing outward and sticking out a few inches from the edge of the shirt. Now, roll up the shirt, tossing in a toothbrush and other toiletries if you like once you have a roll, fold the edges of the sock over the ends of the roll to create a nice, tight bundle.You can make multiple bundles for packing for a longer trip, using this method to keep the individual items for specific days separate, saving you from having to dig through your bag for the right pair of socks.

, If you want to pack more items or want to be extra sure to prevent wrinkles, pack with a larger bundle.Start by laying your blazers and tailor shirts on top of each other at 180 degree angles. Line up the top of the shoulder on one with the underside of the arm on the other, so that the sleeves are layered on top of each other. Alternate layer by layer, moving from nice shirts to tees and finally to pants, which should be placed perpendicular to the rest, following the arms of the shirts instead. Finally, fold your pajamas into a square and place this at the center. Now, wrap each item around that center bundle individually, pulling over the left sleeve, right sleeve, top and bottom. Smooth the fabric as you wrap until the whole bundle is ready to go. Simply strap it into your suitcase and you're ready.


Keep in mind, however, that this method isn't very TSA-bag-search-friendly. Don't use this method if you know you're not going to have a lot of time at the airport, since you'll have to take the time to refold the bundle.

, Look for spots in your suitcase with empty space. This empty space can be taken advantage of to save even more room. For example, you can use the inside of shoes to store socks and underwear.You'll also want to pass on using bags with lots of compartments, pockets, and zippers. These just add weight. You're better off utilizing a large, open space and using bundles or bags to keep items separate.

, If you're not worried about wrinkles (such as if you're just flying home to visit your parents), you can save yourself even more space by compressing your clothes. Use a vacuum seal bag, a large ziplock, or even an extra pair of Spanx to compress the bundles we helped you make in earlier steps.


The Spanx or other shape wear items are very useful for this purpose. Buy a cheap pair that are intended for a waist size about as big as the bundle you made. Just fit it over the bundle and you'll find you have even more space.

, Leave some extra room in your suitcase for any new items that might come home with you. This will be very important, especially if you don't want to pay to have to ship things or get an extra suitcase to take home with you.


Especially with international and vacation travel, it's safe to assume that you'll probably buy new clothes while you're there, so there's no need to pack an outfit for every day that you'll be gone.

, Be prepared and make sure you're organized with everything else that goes in your suitcase. Have your electronics changed and pack the charger (as well as a converter for international travel). Bring extra pills if you take medication. Have cash money ready for immediate use, in the event that your cab driver doesn't take cards. You'll also want to have a sheet with contact information, addresses, and directions on your person, in case your bag gets lost.

, Pack a separate ziploc full of items that you'll want to use while you're on the plane. This bag can be placed in the front pocket of your suitcase or even in your purse, making it easy to access. This will help prevent the need to dig through your suitcase as you stand awkwardly in the aisle.


Include items like your mp3 player, your headphones, medication, snacks, and a book in this separate bag.

Select a box that will allow you to pack no more than 10 lbs (about 4.5 kg).,
Put cushion foam or packing peanuts at the bottom of the box before adding any wrapped pieces.,
Wrap individual items in plain newsprint or bubble wrap.,
Pack the wrapped items into the box.,
Fill in all the empty areas of the box with foam, scrunched-up paper, or packing peanuts.,
Tape or shut the lid firmly.",How to Pack and Ship Your Fine China or Glassware," In the packing industry, the right size box for china and glassware is often called a ""dish pack"" barrel, or dish barrel.It is important to keep the size compact because packing too many pieces in a single box makes the box difficult to move, and provides a temptation for movers to put a larger, heavier box at the bottom of a stack when loading into trucks, which can mean that your best china ends up sitting under too much weight.;
, The box must be crowded with peanuts or foam., (Avoid printed newspaper as the ink will rub off on whatever is wrapped with it and will not wash off of items with a porous surface.) Wrap each piece separately. If you wrap more than one item per sheet of paper, be sure that no china or glass areas come into contact with other glass or china. Ensure adequate layering and excellent padding around each item - this isn't the time to skimp on wrapping materials.

, Arrange the wrapped items in the box, with cushion foam or scrunched-up paper placed between each piece. Ensure that the sides of the objects being packed are at least 1"" (2.5cm) away from the edge of the box. Certain items require special attention:


For plates, place them on their edge, as they are much stronger packed that way, making certain they do not touch the bottom. Put scrunched up newspaper at the bottom of a box carrying plates, and then slide cardboard, bubble wrap, or foam between them. It is recommended to wrap each plate in a few sheets of paper to keep them well padded and to prevent them from coming into contact with each other.






Wrap the lids of items such as sugar bowls, teapots, and casserole dishes separately from the main portion. If the lid is very small, gently tape it in place after wrapping both pieces so it will not be lost. Then wrap the item as a single unit.






Make a set of inside spacers from cardboard to keep your glassware separated. Doing this can save them from being broken. Also, heavier glasses should be packed on the bottom, with lighter, more fragile glasses placed on top.







, This will prevent the items from moving around or shifting inside the box.


Check for movement. If there is any movement, add more stuffing to prevent it.
If you are using a shipper such as FedEx or UPS, use double boxing with packing peanuts to fill empty space between the outer and inner boxes.

, Even if the lid has a special shutting mechanism, it pays to tape over it to prevent accidental opening during transit. Write ""FRAGILE"" and ""THIS WAY UP"" on the sides and top of the box. It is also a good idea to note the exact contents of the box, such as ""glassware"", or ""china plates"", etc.


Check for the potential for indentation. If the box can be compressed in any way from items placed on it, this pressure can damage the contents. If you can press the lid in, add more stuffing to stop it from being compressed.

Shift the bicycle chain onto the small chain ring, and the largest rear cog, before attempting to remove the pedals.
Turn the right pedal counter-clockwise, and the left pedal clockwise, to unthread.
Loosen and remove the seat post and seat as a unit. Once removed, retighten the seat post bolt so the seat does not fall out.
Set all loose parts safely aside.

, Ensure the block fits snugly and cannot be easily removed in order to protect the forks from damage.

,, You can use bubble wrap, cardboard tubing or an appropriately cushioned packing material. This will protect the bicycle and its parts from being scratched, nicked or otherwise damaged during transit.

,, Use additional shipping material to fill any empty space in order to prevent the bike from rattling or shifting inside of the box.

Decide how much power you need.,
Determine how much unobstructed sunlight you receive in the location you intend to set up solar panels.,
Divide your total power consumption from Step 1 by the number of hours you came up with in Step 2.,
Buy solar panels.,
Consider ""B-grade"" panels which are significantly cheaper, yet come with reasonable warranties.,
Buy batteries.,
Buy a charge controller.,
If you plan on running devices off of AC power (i.e.",How to Set Up a Small Solar (Photovoltaic) Power Generator," To do so, determine which electronic devices you would like to use, then find out how much power they use. Most devices have wattage ratings, which can then be multiplied by the number of hours of use to produce ""Watt-hours"" (Wh), which is a unit of power consumption. For example, if you intend to use a 15W device for 2 hours a day, that's 15W x 2h = 30Wh. Note, however, that ratings are usually higher than the actual power consumption. To determine how much a device actually draws, you can use a meter like the Kill-a-Watt. Once you have all the Watt-hours, add them up. If the total exceeds 1000Wh (or 1 Kilowatt-hour), this How to may not be suitable for you.;
, Unobstructed literally means that there are no shadows. If a tree, neighboring building, or anything else casts a shadow in that particular spot, don't count the time during which a shadow exists. So, if you get 12 hours of sunlight, but the sun is beyond the fence for 2 hours in the morning, then behind a tree for an hour at noon, then shadowed by your neighbor's barn for 2 hours before sunset, you only get to count 7 hours. Note also that days are shorter in Winter. If you intent to use your set up in Winter, use your Winter hours.

, If you decide you need 600Wh and that you get 6h of sunlight, that's 600Wh / 6h = 100W. This is the amount of power you need to generate per hour of sunlight to meet your needs. To be safe, multiply that by at least 2 or more. This is to account for the fact that solar panels only generate their rated output when pointed directly at the sun, and if your solar panels are fixed, they won't be facing directly at the sun most of the time. After various inefficiencies, you may lose another 20% or more of the power generated. If you expect regular and sustained cloud coverage, you may need to multiply by 5 or more (or simply reduce consumption to live within your means).

, Broadly speaking, there are 3 types of solar panels (strictly speaking, photovoltaic cells): amorphous silicon, polycrystalline, and monocrystalline. Amorphous silicon panels are relatively inexpensive, relatively unaffected by small shadows, but are very inefficient in terms of space (for the same power rating, amorphous silicon panels will be larger and heavier). Polycrystalline panels are more efficient, cheaper than monocrystalline, but also less efficient. Monocrystalline panels are the most efficient, but also the most expensive. Output from mono- and polycrystalline panels can be halved or less by even a tiny shadow because of the way individual cells are wired. Mono- and poly-crystalline panels can be purchased these days can under $1 per Watt., While some people want their panels to last 25 years, the reality is that the cost of PV cells are coming down so rapidly that replacing or augmenting your panels in another 5-10 years may actually be cheaper than paying more now for ones that last longer. If the solar panels are more expensive than your budget allows, consider lowering your power consumption. Turning off or forgoing some devices won't kill you (and if it will, this How to is not for you).Calculate the amount of battery capacity you need. To do this, take the power consumption estimated in Step 1, then double it, because only about half the batteries' capacity should be considered usable to avoid over-discharge. Then, multiply by the number of days' reserve you would like. For instance, if you want to use 600Wh, you need 1200Wh (or 1.2kWh) of capacity, so if you had 3.6kWh, you'll be good for a few days even if the sun disappears (though you may have other problems at that point). Since most batteries have capacities in Amp-hours, it may be best to convert Wh to Ah. To do so, divide the capacity you calculated by the battery's voltage, so 3600Wh / 12V = 300Ah (divide by 6 for 6V batteries).

, While normal car batteries will work (for a while), it is best to use ""deep-cycle"" batteries, which are generally marketed for use in RVs and boats. Some people prefer 6V golf cart batteries, which are designed to withstand repeated deep discharges. If using 6V batteries, connect two in series (positive terminal of one connects to negative of the other), then connect pairs in parallel (positive of one pair with positive of the other pair, negative with negative). If your budget allows, you may consider AGM batteries, which can take more ""abuse"", but also cost 2-3x what lead acid batteries cost. Make sure the Ah ratings of all batteries added together is higher than the capacity you calculated in the previous step. If using multiple batteries, make sure to get multiples of the same battery, and to get them all new (or reconditioned) at the same time. Mixing different capacity, model, or age batteries can shorten all of their lifespans.

, Charge controllers can cost as little as $10 or over $100. The most important thing is to actually use a charge controller. If you hook up solar panels directly to some batteries, the batteries will charge for a while, but they could quickly be ruined. Whichever charge controller you get needs to support the amount of current your solar panels produce. Most charge controllers are rated in Amps, so divide the Watt rating of your solar panels by 12V (e.g. 200W / 12V ~= 17A). Find a charge controller with a rating higher than your theoretical estimate. This will give you a safety margin, as well as some headroom for growth in the future. Beyond that, exactly which charge controller to buy is basically a trade-off between cost vs efficiency and battery-life. The more expensive charge controllers will use different charging algorithms best suited to the type of battery you have. They also may compensate for temperature to better protect your batteries.

, use normal wall plugs), you will also need an inverter. There are broadly two types of inverters: modified sine wave and pure sine wave. Pure sine wave inverters give you power that is closer to city power, but these inverters tend to be more expensive ($150+ for a 600W inverter). Modified sine wave inverters can be much cheaper ($30+ for a 400W inverter), but some devices may not work, or work well with them. Note also that inverters have 80-90% efficiency, which means you lose some power in the DC to AC conversion. However, if you've followed all previous steps as recommended, your set-up should have the excess capacity to absorb this inefficiency.

Figure out what you really need.,
Make a budget of things to buy when you get there.,
Sell, donate, and trade your stuff.,
Figure out how much furniture you'll need.,
Pack a couple pillows.,
Bring only your beauty essentials.,
Be organized while packing.,
Don’t work out before you move.,
Keep your new place tidy and organized.",How to Pack for Moving When You Move a Lot," You don’t need everything you think you need. When living in dorms and apartments, try to only bring the essentials. This is easier said than done and requires a bit of practice to get right. Clothes are a major thing that need to be downsized, which might require a bit of planning and strategy. Do you really need those 4 winter coats? Pick the most comfortable one, the one you wear the most, or the one that goes well with other items of clothing to take with you. You also won't need 15 of your favourite purses. You'll even need a bit of strategy when packing books (they’re heavy). Pick a few of your absolute favourites to bring with you, and borrow the rest from your local library. Think about where you’re moving, and plan realistically. If you’re closer to home, you can afford to leave things there. If you’re going far away, think about what’s cheapest to buy when you get there, and don’t waste valuable bag/box space on things like laundry detergent.;
, As mentioned in the step above, don't waste room on things that you can easily buy once you move in. Instead, make a list and a budget of the things you'll need to buy once you get there. You’ll have to use your judgment, depending on how much money you’ll have when you get to your destination. When you’re moving out, it’s easy to get into “throwaway” mode. Everything gets so overwhelming, you reach the point where barely anything seems necessary. Scotch tape? Cleaning supplies? Those little things will add up. For a first move, it probably a good idea to buy those things when you get there. But when you choose to throw out all of your lotion, etc, with every move, you (and your wallet) will regret it. When paring down your supplies to the bare necessities, and make sure it’s the inexpensive stuff that you’re leaving out.

, If you have tons of clothes, but only wear half of them, what’s the point of lugging them everywhere? Trade them for some better pieces, or sell them so that you can afford to invest in some high-quality pieces in mix-and-matchable colors that you’ll wear all the time. When moving around frequently, the last thing you want is to lug around clothes you never wear, so find a consignment store/thrift store and donate all of the clothes you rarely wear. If you make money off the transaction, or get store credit, trade in/buy things you really want!

, Do some research into the dorm/apartment you'll be living in. Some of them are fully/partially furnished. You can really get by on less than you need. For short-term living, use suitcases instead of having to bring a dresser for your clothes. When looking long-term, try Craigslist; there are tons of free things there. Utilize your space wisely, for example, use up wall space by putting up shelves rather than using tables or dressers to display your things.

, Pillows are actually some of those things that you really need more of. They’re fairly cheap, they’re light (you can squish them into space bags and suck them paper thin), they’re cuddly, they’ll make even the most uncomfortable bed bearable, and they’ll prop you up while you’re trying to do work. For some, living with only one pillow can be a nightmare. Bring at least a couple on your first move, then decide if you need to bring them on future moves.

, Beauty products suck at travelling. You know all the awesome makeup products you thought you had to have in high school? Or hair products? Or perfume? You’re going to hate all of them come moving time. They’re usually bulky, they usually leak, and they’re usually just not worth it. You don’t need four body sprays, you need one nice one that you’ll use all the time. A few weeks before you move, try to use up everything you have left — don’t go out and buy huge bottles of conditioner. If your move is getting closer and you're in need of something, buy a travel-sized item that can be used up quickly instead of a large item that you'll need to pack.

, Pack things according to category (kitchen supplies, makeup, clothing, papers), and make sure to label the boxes. Make sure lids are closed, and bottles are enclosed in ziploc bags (when moving, ziplocs are your best friends). When you’re unpacking, you won’t have to deal with lotion all over your jeans, and if you decide to wait to unpack for a couple days, you’ll still be able to locate the essentials without tearing everything apart. Although it may take more time originally, it makes unpacking so much easier.

, Do not attempt to lift weights the day before you move - BAD idea. You’ll be cursing the day you wandered blithely into the gym when you’re trying to lift boxes of 45,000 lb kitchen supplies. If you work out the day before, it will feel like you have too much of everything and you'll get very sore very quickly.

, Even if you’re settled into your new place, try not to get too comfortable. Don’t try to fill every nook and cranny with new things just because you have more storage, and don’t go out and buy tons of new clothes. Remember how hard it was to move your stuff before? It will be even harder if you’re wandering around town collecting stuff just because you can. Keep things organized, neat, and clean, and the next move won’t be so painful, especially if you’re doing everything yourself.

Understand what you will be testing for.,
Purchase a home water quality test kit.,
Read the directions.,
Expose each strip to water.,
Remove the strip from the water.,
Determine the quality of your water.",How to Test Water Quality1," The quality of water depends primarily on the concentration of bacteria, lead, pesticides, nitrites/nitrates, chlorine, hardness, and the water's pH. Chlorine aids in disinfecting; nitrates leached from fertilizers are harmful to infants; calcium and magnesium (“hardness”) can cause scale buildup in pipes; and water with very high pH levels (acidic water) can corrode fixtures.;
, There are many manufacturers of these kits, but they all function similarly. They will contain test strips that you will expose to water, causing them to change color based on the water's mineral content. You will then match the strip's color to a color chart.


Look for a test kit that contains different strips for bacteria, lead, pesticides, nitrites/nitrates, chlorine, hardness, and pH.
If a kit contains only a single kind of strip, it will likely be for testing pH only.

, In your test kit, there will be some directions. These will explain exactly how long each type of strip should be exposed to water, as well as what temperature the water should be. These directions can vary from test kit to test kit, so even if you have done this before, it is crucial to read and follow the instructions.

, Follow the guidelines in your test kit to expose each strip to water. Typically, you will start by filling a glass with room temperature water. Then, you will dip the strip into the water and keep it submerged for about 5 seconds, moving it back and forth gently.

, Pull the strip out of the glass and shake off any excess water. Wait for the strip to slowly change color, as you compare it to the color chart included with the testing kit.

, Compare each strip's color to the color chart to determine the level of each substance in your water. The color chart will designate different concentration levels as either acceptable or hazardous.


If you register a hazardous result for any mineral, bacteria, or for pH, perform the test again to make sure that the result is not due to human error.
If the test shows a hazardous result a second time, contact your local municipality.

Assess your needs.,
Learn what the Cost is to Maintain.,
Take into consideration your Climate and Location.,
Consider your lifestyle.If your job or hobbies require you to transport large quantities of goods, small cars or cars with insufficient trunk space can quickly become a poor choice of an eco-friendly vehicle.,
Family Size.,
For small families, look for a smaller vehicles that consumes less fuel and are more eco-friendly to manufacture.

,
For large families, look for a car that is both fuel efficient and large enough to satisfy your family’s needs.

,
If you commute to work, like many people do, you have to take into account the style of driving you will be doing during your commute.,
Determine Average Miles per Day.,
Consider the Fuel Sources-Benefits/Drawbacks.,
Know about its Good Gas Mileage-Gasoline...Good gas mileage is not an eco-friendly technology however; many cars today are designed to have very low emissions even exceeding the governments mandated emissions levels.,
Know about alternatives.",How to Select an Eco Friendly Vehicle," When looking for a car, one of the biggest things to consider are your needs. How big is your family/how many passengers do you need to be able to move around? What is your lifestyle like do you have to pull a trailer or need a roof rack? Finally what is your career and commute like? Do you drive long distances to work or have to park in tight city parking spots? All of these factors determine the type of car that is right for you.;
, The consensus is that buying an eco-friendly vehicle will pay for itself over the life of the vehicle. Data is still being collected due to the fact that this is a relatively new design. One thing to keep in mind is that since there are fewer eco friendly cars on the road today as compared to gas engines that the insurance rates may be a little higher because the parts on the car are newer technology and there is less supply of them. Another thing to keep in mind is that there is a small number of certified mechanics to work on these newer eco friendly cars so you might have to take your car to the dealership for repairs versus your local mechanic.

, Climate is important to a vehicle’s eco-friendliness because engines and other car systems operate differently in other climates. In hot or very humid climate, engines that are very active or gasoline based are prone to overheating or consuming more fuel. In very cold climates, gasoline engines might not even function properly. Heating and cooling elements in the car are also affected by this. The more they are used, the more pollution they create. The following are the main environments that an eco-friendly vehicle will be subjected to:


Urban...Stop and go traffic favors cars that have an easier time accelerating from a full stop. When a car takes off from stationary position ,the engine’s revolutions per minute spike, causing a loss in fuel efficiency. More fuel is consumed when RPM is high. Look for small cars or cars with smaller engines and with automatic transmission.
Suburban...If you live in suburbs, then you will likely encounter much less stop and go traffic, as well as a lot highway driving. This situation favors cars that achieve less engine revolutions per minute at high speeds. Look for a car with more powerful engines and with manual transmission.
Rural...Rural driving is a mix of urban and suburban driving. You are likely to encounter unpaved roads and steep inclines as much as long, traffic-free roads. Your car will also be susceptible to wear because of harsher driving conditions. Look for a car with a more powerful engine and good suspension and tires to reduce the likelihood of engine failure.

, Look for cars that have sufficient storage space so that you reduce the amount of time driving.

, You must take into account the size of your family when looking for an eco-friendly vehicle. If you have a larger family, it would become less convenient to stick to smaller vehicles. If you have a small family or are single, then a small gasoline-powered, hybrid, or flex-fuel vehicle might be more eco-friendly than a larger vehicle of the same kind.

,,, See Urban, Suburban and Rural sections above to figure out what kind of car to look for.

, Before you finalize what kind of fuel your car is going to use, you must find out how many miles you drive on an average day. It is a good idea to tally up the total miles driven over a 2-4 week period and dividing by the amount of days that you drove the car. If you only count the miles driven in one day, you might not get an accurate number.


Ex: 600 miles (970 km) driven over 4 weeks, but no driving is done on Sundays. Total days driven is 4 * 6 = 24. Average miles per day is 600 / 24 = 25

, When you are trying to find the right eco-friendly car you must take in consideration the pros and cons of the available fuel technologies. In this section we will shed some light on the good and bad qualities of each available fuel source.

, The good is that these vehicles do emit very low levels of pollution while getting upwards on average of 40mpg highway and 29mpg city. The bad is that the vehicle still uses gasoline as its fuel source and this means, even though low, the fuel emissions are still being produced harming the ecosystem. Another bad to using gasoline is the price. The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. has been rising for the past two decades. Gasoline is also subject to sharp price spikes in short intervals. On average the largest spike in gasoline was $4.11, but could be higher or lower depending on your region

,


Bio-fuel/Bio-diesel...Bio-diesel is derived from vegetables, almost like vegetable oil. The good is that this bio-diesel fuel burns cleaner and its only emission is nitrous-oxide. You can obtain on average 30 MPG city and 42 MPG highway. The cars that run on bio-diesel have near double the engine life of their gasoline cousin. The bad of bio-diesel is that price per gallon is in line with or slightly higher than gasoline. Producing this fuel requires a large agricultural effort to keep enough food and bio-fuel to meet the demand of both industries.
Diesel...Diesel and bio-diesel have the same MPG. Today’s diesel engines last longer and have lower emissions than gasoline but not as low as bio-diesel. The bad of diesel is that it is still made with fossil fuels and its price per gallon is still on par with gasoline or higher.
Electric...Vehicles using electricity have been a growing alternative to combustion engines using gasoline. The good of electricity is the mile per gallon equivalent to gasoline (MPG) or in other words the measure of Kilo-Watts per 100 miles (160 km) (kW-hrs/100 miles) in electric vehicles can get up to 100MPGe highway and 85MPGe city. The electric vehicle doesn't have any of the pollution associated with fossil fuels. There is also a tremendous reduction in noise originating from the vehicle in operation. Electric technology is also very cheap to use. The bad of electric vehicles is that there are not a lot of filling stations for longer trips on the road. The home charging units are expensive around $2,500 for a permanent installation. The fastest full charge you can get at home is 4 hours, the longest is 8 hours. Finally the maintenance and insurance is higher on electric vehicles due to the complexity of the electric technology.
Hybrid...The hybrid vehicle is a combination of a combustion engine and an electric engine. The good of hybrids is that they allow you to go the extra distance on gasoline if the electric runs out. The hybrid vehicles range on average from 29 to 40 MPG city and highway respectively. It is also good that these vehicles still have substantially lower emissions than the full combustion engine. The price of the electric fill is much more affordable than the gasoline. The bad of hybrids is that they still have emissions and there is the higher cost of gasoline. The $2,500 cost of the home charging units is another bad of the hybrids. Lastly, the maintenance and insurance is higher on hybrid vehicles due to the complex parts in the electric technology.
Natural Gas...The natural gas technologies also know as compressed natural gas (CNG) is on par with gasoline except it burns cleaner. The good of CGN vehicle is that it gets 24MPG city and 36MPG highway. The bad of CGN is that it isn’t used by the average consumer. The Honda Civic GX NGV is the only vehicle in production using CNG that an individual can purchase. The rest of the available CGN vehicles are for fleet proposes only.

Smell the water.,
Taste the water.,
Check for cloudiness and particles.,
Examine the color.,
Check your pipes for corrosion or build-up.",How to Test Water Quality2," You can determine a great deal about the quality of your water by tuning in to your senses. Even if a professional water engineer were to come test your water quality, they would be sure to smell, taste, and visually examine the water. Test the quality of your water through your senses, first, by giving it a good smell.Bleach smell – This likely occurs from the chlorine your local treatment plant must add to your water to make it safe. This scent often dissipates if the water is exposed to air for a little while. Alternatively, you can purchase a home water filter to get rid of it. Generally, a bleach smell is not harmful.
Rotten-egg smell – This sulfurous smell usually indicates a growth of bacteria. First, pour a glass of water and bring it to another part of the house, wait a few minutes, and then smell it. If the water no longer smells, then the bacteria is growing inside your drain and should be cleaned. If the water still smells strongly of rotten egg (and if this occurs with both hot and cold water), contact your local municipality.
Musty or earthy smell – This smell is likely the result of organic matter decaying. Once again, this could either be inside your drain or in the water itself. Although this smell may be bothersome, it is most likely harmless.

, Use your taste buds to determine the quality of your water. First of all, if your water tastes very foul, spit it out! If your tap water has a metallic taste, this can be caused by either low pH levels, or excess minerals in your water supply (potentially due to rusty pipes). If your water taste like bleach, it could be an excess of chlorine. And if your water tastes salty, this could indicate the presence of chloride ions or sulfates, which could be caused by industrial waste or irrigation drainage. If the taste of your water offends you, contact your local municipality, or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)., Hold a glass of water up to the light and look for floating particles or general cloudiness. Brown, orange, or red particles can be caused by rust in pipes or fixtures. Black particles can come from the hoses that your water runs through (chlorine in the water can deteriorate these hoses over time). White or tan particles (or general cloudiness) can indicate excess calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate in your water. If you notice excess cloudiness or particulate matter in your water, contact your local municipality, or the EPA.

, Begin examining the color of your water by first allowing the water to run for a few minutes. (This will clear any build up from standing water in your fixtures). Then hold a glass of water up to the light. Brown, murky, or otherwise discolored water can be caused by a few factors: a new water source for your area, upstream pollution, or rusty pipes. If the color of your water seems wrong to you, contact your local municipality, or the EPA., If your pipes have a great deal of corrosion or mineral build-up, it means that excess rust or other minerals have been getting into your water. There are a few ways you look for corrosion or build-up around your house. If your pipes have a great deal of build-up, have them looked over by a professional plumber and contact your local municipality.If your pipes are above ground, look for any areas that leak or have blue and/or white sediment.
If your pipes are harder to get to, look inside your toilet bowl for rust, or around the base of your toilet for blue stains.
If you are having any plumbing work done, ask to see inside a cut portion of your pipe. Look for blue, white, or rust-colored build-up.

This data is compiled in the form of a “Water Quality Report,” you can test the quality of your water by obtaining a copy of this report. To do this, simply contact your local municipality.

, Water Quality Reports will also commonly be available through the website for your town or city. Visit your local website, download a current Water Quality Report, and determine the quality of your water.

, This online database has compiled nearly 20 million records obtained from state water officials. Simply plug in your zip code and you can pull up Water Quality Reports for your area., Contacting your village hall can be another method for obtaining a Water Quality Report for your area. This can be a good option is you are not sure how to reach the local municipality. Your village hall can either provide you with the Water Quality Report, or inform you about where you can obtain one.

, Finally, another method for procuring a Water Quality Report in your are is to speak to your water company. A representative from your water company should be able to provide you with a current Water Quality Report, or at the very least, tell you where you can obtain one.

",How to Remove Oil Stains from Concrete Driveway and Garage1," Kitty litter does a great job for both cats and concrete because it's highly absorbent.;
, When it comes to kitty litter cleanup, you do not want the expensive, clumping kind. You want the inexpensive kind that happens to be super absorbent.

, Use a generous amount, and completely cover the oil stain.

, Wait for a bit, and give the litter a chance to work. If it's just a little bit, 10 to 15 minutes should be enough. For bigger spills, let it sit a couple hours, or even overnight.

, Using your grubby shoes, crush the litter on the oil, breaking it up and grinding it into the oily spot, like a scrub brush. When you're done scrunching, sweep up and discard the dirty litter.

, Using a concentrated detergent and a stiff brush, scrub the area in a circular motion. Be vigorous where the oil is, and then continue scrubbing beyond the spill, with a lighter touch. This will even out the difference between the scrubbed area and the rest of your driveway.

, After you've scrubbed, rinse away the detergent, and check to see how well the litter and detergent and your elbows have done their job.


If it looks good, clean up, and call it a day.
If it's still too stained, use more detergent and scrub more.

Grade the area.,
Clean up your new driveway.,
Maintain your driveway.",How to Make a Gravel Driveway," Survey your yard and decide where your driveway should be. Also, decide if you want a parking area or a circular driveway. Remember that a larger driveway will be more expensive than a smaller one.


Watch for any drainage issues in the area where the driveway will be. It is important to position your driveway so that the water will run off the sides and not pool in the middle of it.;
, You may delineate your driveway area with landscaping timber or bricks. This is optional., You will need to mark off the area of your new driveway before starting the driveway project.


Place sticks or landscape stakes in the ground every 8 to 10 feet along the length of one side of the area that will be your driveway.
Place a second set of stakes at least 10 to 12 feet across from the first set of stakes to mark the width of the driveway. You may want to make the width 14 feet if your driveway curves., You will need to know the length and width of your entire driveway. If your driveway curves, you might want to measure in sections and add them together instead of trying to measure all at once.

, For a really stable driveway, experts recommend laying three separate layers of different sizes of stone.This will take extra money and planning, so you need to decide early if this is the type of driveway you want.

, Laying a gravel driveway yourself, even if it is fairly short in length, will require time and physically intense labor. If you are physically unable to do heavy lifting and repetitive work (such as raking the gravel), you may need to hire someone to help you.

, To determine this, you need to multiply your driveway’s length (in feet), width (in feet), and depth (in feet), then divide by 27 to get the cubic yards of gravel.The depth of the gravel can vary, but should be at least 4 to 6 inches. To determine this measurement in feet, divide the number of inches by 12 (for example, 6 inches is 0.5 feet).
If you plan to do two to three layers, each layer will need to be 4 to 6 inches thick, so you will to calculate each layer separately.

, Call a local gravel company and tell them how much gravel you need and what size and type of gravel you prefer.


Ask if the company has a website that you can use to choose gravel color, size, and shape.
If you are planning several layers, schedule each delivery separately, preferably a couple of days apart so that you can install each layer and let it settle before putting the next layer on top., You will need a shovel, rigid metal rake, thick gardening gloves, and possibly a wheelbarrow. If you do not have these tools, consider borrowing them from a friend, buying them, or renting them from a home improvement store or tool rental company.

, Ideally, you will use a mechanical compactor to press the dirt and rocks. This would be very expensive to buy for one project, so try to rent it from home improvement store or tool rental company.

, An alternative to obtaining your own tools is to hire someone who has a backhoe. They will be able to do the work much faster than you can do it by hand.

, Using a shovel or hiring someone with a backhoe, remove the top layers of grass and dirt from the marked-off driveway area.


You might want to use a tiller to loosen up the soil and make it easier to dig out.
The amount of soil you remove depends on how many layers of soil you are planning. You should dig 4-6 inches of soil for every layer of rocks you plan to put down.

, This doesn’t have to be perfect since it will be covered by rocks, but your driveway surface should be pretty level—any areas that are deeper than other areas may lead to water pooling and cause mud puddles that have to be filled in with more gravel later.

, Use a mechanical compactor, have someone drive over the area with a bulldozer, or drive over the area repeatedly with a heavy vehicle such as a large truck.

, If you want to prevent grass and weeds from growing through your driveway, you may want to lay a weed barrier underneath your rocks.Weed barrier is a woven landscaping cloth that allows water to pass through it but does not allow weeds to grow through it, and it is available at most landscaping and home improvement stores.
Weed barrier usually comes on a roll. You should be able to lay the roll down at one end of your driveway and unroll it until you have reached the other end of your driveway.
Most weed barrier rolls are 4 feet wide, so you may need to get several rolls. Be sure the amount of weed barrier you buy matches or exceeds the square footage (length times width) of your driveway.

, If you are using landscaping timber or bricks to edge your driveway, you may want to place them before the gravel is delivered so that they can hold the rocks in place. If you do not want a border, you can skip this step.

, Some trucks may only be able to dump the rocks in one big pile, but some trucks can let the rocks out a little at a time, spreading them across the span of your driveway, which will save you a lot of work.

, Use a wheelbarrow to distribute the rocks evenly along the length of your driveway. Then use your shovel and hard metal rake to spread the rocks evenly across the width of your driveway.

, You can also try driving over the area repeatedly with a heavy vehicle such as a large truck.

, If you only have one layer, you can move to the next step.

, Your driveway should be slightly elevated in the middle and lower on the sides to promote water drainage.


You can achieve this by raking in from the sides towards the center so that the rocks are slightly piled higher in the center. You could also add some additional gravel down the center of your driveway and slowly scrape it towards the sides a little at a time.
Don’t go too crazy with the grading; you don’t want your driveway to look like a pyramid. The ideal grade is very subtle, with the middle 2% to 5% higher than the sides., Be sure to “finish” your project by cleaning up. Remove the landscape stakes and twine markers. Put away or return tools that were rented or borrowed, and be sure to pay or thank anyone who helped you with the project.

, When necessary, rake gravel that gets displaced back into your driveway. Also think about adding gravel every two to three years to any low or bare spots that emerge over time.

Really?,
Acquire boxes and paper for wrapping fragile items.,
Use the items in your home creatively for packing.,
Go Room by Room.,
Load the truck.,
Arriving at new home.,
Follow Step 2 of Method 1.

",How to Pack and Move Quickly2," Rent a truck?I know there are articles out there on the nightmares of renting a truck, but personal experience allows me to assure you that this can be a very easy way to go.


There are trucks, trailers, cargo vans and pickups to choose from. It is more cost effective to rent one truck that will hold all of your belongings. What ever company you choose to rent from will suggest a truck size depending on the square footage of your home and how many bedrooms your current home has.
You can call a company the morning of the move to determine availability.   Call as many as necessary until you find an available truck. If a truck is not available, ask the person if they know who has an available truck.
Make sure your car insurance and driver's license are up to date.   Many companies will offer insurance for that day. The cost will be around twenty dollars making it well worth the purchase.

,


If you do not have time or money to wrap fragile items, consider transporting what you can in your own personal car or in the front seat of the truck.
Call your local grocery store or department store very early in the morning for boxes.
Ask friends and family for boxes and old newspapers.
Label everything. A permanent marker and masking tape will work for this task.

,


When loading a dresser, remove all drawers(with clothes in them) load the dresser onto the truck, and then return the drawers to the dresser.
Use laundry baskets to moving things from the kitchen.
Use towels to wrap the fragile items.
Try to use boxes that are the same size. This makes stacking them in the truck much easier.
Use what ever you can find that is useful.  A pillowcase may hold toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorant and other personal items.  A sleeping bag could hold bedding.
When all else fails, use a garbage bag and label it.

, You have your truck and your boxes(and/or home items used creatively).  Now it is time to pack for the move!


In order to prevent feeling overwhelmed, pack one room at a time.
Pick out big items from the room and immediately load them on the truck.  Appliances and furniture should go on first to allow for space.
After you pick, pack and load the big items from a room, pack the fragile items. Ensure they are wrapped well. Set them in a car in the passenger seat, or put them aside to be loaded last.
Now pack all the other items in the room that are not fragile. Set the packages in your garage or another staging location.  These items will be loaded after the furniture and appliances.
Make sure to label everything.  (Example: master bathroom, hygiene products)
After you clear all items from a room, clean it. Shut all windows, turn off the lights. If it is a room with appliance, make sure they are taken care of appropriately (unplugged, water removed from lines, etc.).
Shut the door to indicate to all family members that the room is completely packed and cleaned.
Move to the next room and do the same process.

,


Load all of the big items first.
Load labeled boxes.
Load fragile items in a safe place.
Leave the toilet paper and the light bulbs for the next occupants.

Wait for the driveway to dry.",How to Seal a Driveway,"


The sealant usually comes in 5 gallon (18.927 liters) containers, which can cover as much as 400 square feet (121.92 meters).;
, You will need the sealant, a crack filler, a push broom and a trowel. These items can be found at hardware and home improvement stores.


Depending on the depth of the cracks in your driveway, you may need to purchase joint filler. If the cracks in your driveway are less than 1/2 inch (12.7 mm), the rubberized crack filler found in small tubes will work perfectly. If your cracks are deeper, you will need a patch filler.

, Squeeze the crack filler into the crack to make it level with the rest of the driveway. When using patch filler for deeper cracks, use a trowel to spread the filler and ensure a level surface.

,, Use the push broom to remove any dirt or debris. The sealant requires a clean surface to work properly.

, Do not wet the driveway so much that the water pools.

, Use the manufacturer's directions for mixing times.

, Use the push broom to spread the sealant evenly.


Continue to mix the sealant during the spreading process so it doesn't separate.

, A second coat of sealant may be required if your driveway was old or heavily cracked.

, This can take up to 48 hours. Do not use the driveway even if the sealant feels dry to the touch. The sealant doesn't work until it has completely hardened.

",How to Fix a Hole in an Asphalt Driveway," A small pothole, less than two feet square can be repaired with about 50 pounds of cold mix asphalt filler.;
, Cold asphalt filler (a mixture of asphalt tar and rocks) is sold in plastic bags similar in size to cement bags weighing 50 pounds, and buckets ranging from one gallon to five gallons.

, If the material in the hole is dry soil, you may want to use a garden hose to dampen it because the tar will not stick to dry dirt.

, You can also use a fan or blow dryer if you are in a hurry.

, For repairs where the material underneath the patch is not capable of being compacted with normal methods, you may want to over-excavate the hole and pour concrete to about two inches below the finished pavement grade to stabilize the area.

, This will leave the finished patch level with the pavement after it is packed.

, Make sure the cold asphalt mix is packed firmly into the hole or you will find the patch will fail quickly when it is exposed to traffic.

, You can put a board or piece of plywood over the fix for a few days to ensure that it hardens more but this is optional. If you packed it down tightly, it can be driven over immediately.

Lay out the driveway in the shape you want it.,
Excavate the area for the driveway to a depth of at least 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm) and compact the raw sub-grade.,
Bring in the stone base that will double as support for the brick and drainage.,
Dump the stone in small manageable piles on the sub-grade.,
Install the stone in at least 2 or, better, 3 lifts using a plate vibrator to compact it together.,
Hold the last lift of stone to a grade that allows for 2 inches (5.1 cm) of sand and the 3 inch (7.6 cm) brick paver.,
Cover the stone with landscape cloth to stop weeds from coming up between the pavers.,
Place 2 inches (5.1 cm) of sand over the cloth to bed the paver block in.

,
Set the plastic brick edge retainer in place following manufacturer's instructions.

,
Begin at the center of the end of the driveway and work out toward the edges using brick spacers to keep even spacing.,
Use a 3 foot (1 m) length of 2 x 4-inch (5.1 X 10.2 cm) wood to lay across the bricks every couple of feet.,
Start on the second row, centering the brick over the joint of the 2 bricks in the middle.,
Continue the previous 3 steps to the completion of the driveway.

,
Use masonry sand to fill the joints between the brick by spreading it out over the brick sweeping it into the joints.

,
Spray water from a hose over the brick to settle the sand into the joints.",How to Install a Brick Driveway," Stake it out using wooden stakes and marking spray paint.


A string line tied between stakes can help guide you while laying out the shape and grade as well as during the actual construction. This will keep you on grade.
Be sure the driveway will be able to drain when completed.;
,


Because of the amount of digging and excavated material to be disposed of, it is recommended that you hire an excavation contractor.
The contractor will have the equipment, haul truck, experienced personnel and location necessary to haul off the waste.

, You will need either stone screenings or pea-gravel, depending on what is available in your area.

, Begin spreading the rock using shovels, a Wheelbarrow and a garden rake.

, The small rock will form a solid base once it has been compacted.

, The string line you stretched between the grade stakes in the beginning will help here.

, This will also keep the sand from shifting down through the stone.

,,, Starting in the middle will ensure that the bricks on each side, or edge, are the same size. This provides a uniform look.

, Tap the wood with a rubber mallet to settle the brick into the bed of sand evenly as you install them.

, This will give you a herringbone pattern, similar to what you see on brick that has been laid on a house.

,,, This will also clean off the brick.

Clean the area with oil stains with water from a hose or bucket.",How to Clean Oil Off a Driveway1," Depending on what kind of stain you have, you might use different methods for cleaning the oil off your driveway.

If you have an oil stain that is still fresh or if you have a small and stubborn stain, you may want to use the poultice method to get out your stain.
If your stain is small, you can use a common household detergent method to remove the stain.
If your stain is large, you may want to buy a degreaser or a microbial cleaner to remove the oil.;
, You can buy all the following materials from Home Depot, Lowes, online or at your local hardware store. Depending on what kind of stain you have or the method you are using, you will have to get different materials.

For small stains you will need: 1) a detergent (baking soda, vinegar, soap, dish or laundry detergent) 2) a bucket or pot and hose for water 3) a steel brush or stiff brush with stiff bristles
If you have a small, hard to remove stain use the poultice method: 1) kitty litter 2) acetone, lacquer thinner, or xylene 3) a sheet of plastic slightly larger than the size of your stain 4) a steel brush or stiff brush with stiff bristles
For larger stains you will need: 1) a degreaser or microbial cleaner (buy online)2) a bucket or hose for water 3) a steel brush or stiff brush with stiff bristlesIf you have fresh stains or anticipate further oil leaks, consider buying a bag of baking soda or kitty litter to keep in your garage to use in the future.

, Wear goggles or eye protection to shield your eyes from the chemicals. Find chemical resistant gloves at a superstore or hardware store to wear while you scrub. Additionally, wear overalls you would use for working on a car if you have them. Or you can wear clothes that cover your arms and legs and that you don’t mind getting stained or dirty., Keep your pets and kids inside while you work. In case of any accidents, have the number of poison control written down or recorded in your phone. You can call poison control 24 hours a day, 7 days a week- the number for poison control is: 1 (800) 222-1222.








, Prior to cleaning the pavement wash off any dirt and debris that is in the way of the oil stain on your driveway. However, do not use a high pressure hose to clean off the affected area, because you could end up pushing the oil deeper into the pavement.

",How to Depave Your Driveway," Dial 811 to have some friendly folks come out within two days to mark the locations of underground utility lines. It is no fun to accidentally discover a gas line with your pickaxe.;
, While you are waiting for the utility notification folks, determine the thickness of the pavement by looking at the edge or by poking at existing cracks. This will allow you determine the total volume of pavement you will need to get rid of.

, This will depend on the type of pavement, the thickness, the total area you are removing, and your stamina. Small areas of thin (under 3 inches) concrete and asphalt can be removed with a sledgehammer or pickaxe. For larger areas or places with thicker pavement, you will either want to use a concrete saw or a jackhammer. If you are using a jackhammer, select a wider 'spade' bit for asphalt and a narrower 'chisel' bit for concrete. For really large areas over a couple hundred square feet, or if it is reinforced concrete, you will want to rent a skid-steer with a breaker attachment.

, The key to pavement removal is giving the pavement somewhere to move. This means you should start at a corner or at lease an edge if possible. Try to pry a larger breaker bar under the pavement. Place some blocks under the breaker bar, creating a fulcrum, in order to increase your leverage. If you are able to lift up the pavement away from the ground, it will be much easier to break. If you are unable to lift the pavement off the ground, try clearing dirt away from the sides, so the pavement can at least have room to move and break horizontally.

, Once broken into manageable pieces, concrete chunks are useful as stepping stones, retaining walls, or as foundation blocks for small structures. If you have no use for it, place an ad on Craigslist, and others will gladly take it off of your hands. Asphalt is less useful to reuse at home, but can be taken to an asphalt recycling place, and then reused by road builders. To ensure your urbanite is quickly and efficiently taken off your hands, consider renting a concrete-only drop box from a company that will haul it off for reuse or recycling.

, Now that the earth underneath the pavement can breathe, you will want to help bring it back to life. Add organic matter such as compost, manure, leaves, wood chips, grass clippings, or food scraps, to help attract critters that will aerate and revitalize the soil. You can also loosen the compacted soil with a spading fork.If you are concerned about soil contamination, you can send a soil sample to a local lab for testing. It is likely that the pavement actually protected the soil from contamination from lead paint, antifreeze, brake dust, or other urban pollutants.

Pour detergent on the affected area.,
Use hot water to scrub the detergent with a brush.,
Use a poultice mixture on hard to remove, small stains.,
Pour a couple of cans of Coke or Pepsi on the affected area.",How to Clean Oil Off a Driveway2," Slowly pour the liquid or powder detergent on the spot until it is completely covered. Your detergent can be a common household product: baking soda, vinegar, soap, dish or laundry detergent. Let the detergent sit on the stain for 15-30 minutes if it is liquid.







, You can heat water in a large pot of water while the detergent is sitting on the stain. Or, using your bucket, get hot water from the tap. Pour the hot water onto the stain, and vigorously brush the detergent with hot water and a steel or stiff bristled brush. Scrub the spot for a minute or two, and then rinse the area with hot water or water from a hose. 








Repeat the process as necessary if the stain is still there. Wait a day to see if any more oil has surfaced on the pavement. This can happen with oil stains and you should repeat the process if it does.

, You can also use this mixture on fresh oil spills, because the absorbent material will soak up the oil. This mixture is good for small and difficult stains but may be less practical if you are trying to take large stains out of concrete.








Make the mixture by combining an absorbent material, for example, sawdust, kitty litter or baking soda with a solvent like acetone, lacquer thinner, or xylene until it is a thick paste. The components will work together to remove the stain, and the solvent will break up the oil while the absorbent material will soak it up.
Spread the material over the stain, about a ¼ of an inch thick.
Last, cover the poultice with plastic, and tape it down to keep it in place.
You can stamp on the plastic to get the mixture into the cracks of the pavement. Wait a day for the mixture to work on the oil stain, and then remove the plastic, sweep up the mixture, and dispose of it. Then wash off the area with water from a hose or bucket. Make sure that there is not a sealer on your driveway - these can be damaged by poultice mixtures.

, Let the soda sit on the oil stain for a day. This is the easiest and least expensive method for removing oil from your cement. Come back the next day and use a hose or bucket to wash off the coke and oil residue. If the stain still remains, consider using another method to remove the oil.

Read the instructions and warning labels on the products you are using before you begin.








Let the degreaser sit on the stain for approximately 1-3 minutes or for the amount of time recommended in the instructions.
If you have a more ingrained stain, you can leave the degreaser on for a little longer. However, do not let the liquid dry.
For weaker stains, you can dilute the degreaser wit up to five parts water. , Wearing your chemical resistant gloves scrub at the stain vigorously with your brush. Let it sit for another 5-10 minutes. Use your hose or bucket to wash away the degreaser with water. Repeat the steps as necessary. 








Repeat the process as necessary if the stain is still there. Wait a day to see if any more oil has surfaced on the pavement. This can happen with oil stains, and you should repeat the process again if it does.

Determine the soil characteristics of the lake, lagoon or stream bed you are installing your piles into.,
Obtain your pilings.,
Rent a 2 or 3 inch (5.1 or 7.6 cm) gasoline-powered water pump, a suction or ""pickup"" hose long enough to draw water from the lake or seawater that you are installing pilings in, and a discharge hose long enough to reach the end of the pier from the location where you plan to set the pump.,
Build a ""jetting pipe"".,
Lay out the location of your pilings by using a 2X4 wood stake driven into the ground on the bank, and another driven into the pond bottom beyond the location of the last piling.,
Stand a piling on end in the water, raise your jet pipe alongside it, and turn on the pump.,
Plumb up the piling with two spirit levels and a bungee cord, and quickly make sure it is vertical before the soil settles back into the hole.,
Wash sand or dirt back around the piling with the jetting pipe after the piling is sunk, to refill the hole what you washed out.",How to Install Posts in the Water for a Dock or Pier," Rock will be unyielding, obviously, so this technique will not work, and silty, muddy material will not support the pier structure. Sandy material is ideal for jetting pilings, but any firm soil will allow jetting.;
, These need to be chemically treated to resist rot, usually with sodium pentachloride at .25%, copper-chlorinated arsenate, at .25%, or creosote. You will need the pilings to be large enough to attach your support joists to, and long enough to allow them to be sunk deep enough in the round to bear the weight you will be putting on them. Because you will achieve a different load bearing in different bottom materials, there is no rule of thumb for how deep the piling should be installed, but a minimum of four feet would be reasonable if the piling seems ""tight"", or secure. Try for 6' deep in the sand. Mark the piles with spray paint at 12"" intervals so you know the depth of penetration. 6"" to 8"" diameter piles are used for small (up to 10,000 lb.) watercraft docks.

, An alternative to the pump may be connecting to a fire hydrant, if your local utility will allow you to do so, but a back flow preventer must be used in this case.

, Depending on the depth of the pile jetting, this will be a 6' to 12' section of 3/4"" pipe with an elbow at one end to attach your pump discharge hose. That will supply water for jetting. Connect a reducing bushing or flatten the other end. That will be your ""jet"", providing a stream of water to wash and blow out a hole for the piling to set into.

, Tie a length of builder's line from the stake on shore to the stake in the water, and measure the distance from piling to piling, marking them with a permanent marker. The string line should be about the height above water you will want the top of the pilings to be when they are set. Set out the offset from other pilings with a 45 degree plastic square, and cut to length bamboo poles snap-tied to it.

, The water rushing through the jet pipe will ""blow out"" a hole underneath the piling, and it should immediately begin to sink. By moving the jetting pipe around the bottom of the piling, you can guide the direction that the hole is created underneath it. By moving the jet from one side of the piling to the other, you can ""steer"" it down straight. In good material, such as sand, you can jet down a piling in a few seconds, provided you have sufficient water pressure and velocity. The sand is seldom clean and can contain roots, mud etc. so use a 6' ice scraper to break through. Roots can cause piles to seat off their desired location. The pilings float so you may need to push them down to obtain better depth (see tips below). 12'x 6"" or 16'x 6"" pilings can be stood up easily by one or two persons. Up to a 12'x 8"" dia. piling can be installed with two people. Larger piles need a crane as they weigh 500 lbs (20' x 8""dia.). A crane can be built simply with a 24' pontoon boat, 2"" steel water pipe, steel cable and a 12v car winch. The design and manufacture would have to be checked for safety before using it. When using a crane you need one person jetting, one guiding the pile and digging and a crane operator. Try to work when the water is calm. However if the pile is out of line, it is easy to jet it out and put it in the correct position. It is possible to install 10 or more piles per day depending on factors such as depth required, bottom make up, sufficient help handling pilings, etc.. Protective wet suit pants, boots and gloves should be used to prevent abrasion loss of skin especially when you have been in the water for some time.

, Once the settling occurs, it will be difficult to change the orientation of the piling.

, This may not be necessary in sand as it settles back in the hole pretty quickly.

Shovel.,
Acquire some salt.,
Wait a couple of hours.,
Be sure to clear out the melted ice and snow.",How to Break up Ice on a Driveway," You can't really penetrate the ice until you get all of the snow off the area. This will only take about 10-15 minutes depending on the size of your driveway. If someone is snow blowing or your kids are playing near the driveway ask them to go inside, go do it somewhere else, or help you.;
, The kind you want can be found at most hardware stores. If all else fails you can just use table salt. Now spread the salt around all over the area. If you have some extra salt you might want to go over it twice to make sure you got everything.

, Go inside and get some hot chocolate or get a blanket. Whatever you want to do for the next 2-3 hours. After that has passed, go back outside and shovel of the rest of the ice! It won't be hard because the salt melted the ice and you just need to shovel a little. And you have a great looking driveway!

, Otherwise, if it gets cold again, it will freeze and you will have substantially more ice than you did before.

Allow 24 hours for the blacktop to dry and cure before parking or walking on the driveway.

",How to Blacktop a Driveway," Blacktop patching material can't solve every problem. Take a look at damaged areas before deciding how to progress:


For depressions, thin cracks, and alligator cracks (cracks in a scaled pattern), repair them yourself as described below.
If the damage covers large areas of the driveway, or if there are long cracks more than ¼"" (6mm) wide, the only permanent solution is to hire a contractor to remove and replace the driveway. Also consider this for any asphalt driveway approaching 20 years old.Hiring a contractor to overlay the driveway with more blacktop is cheaper then replacement, but it is not recommended for driveways with drainage problems, or with large areas of alligator cracks.;
, Use a leaf blower, compressed air blower with nozzle wand, or broom to clear away dirt, dust, and loose stones.

, If there is heavy weed growth, you may want to spray the vegetation with a long-lasting herbicide at least two weeks prior to starting the project. This will ensure the plants do not grow back.


If grass or weeds are growing in cracks in the driveway, scrape them out with a screwdriver, then sweep the cracks with a whisk broom.

, Apply a heavy degreasing detergent and scrub with a sturdy wire-bristled brush.


Avoid using solvent-based cleaners. They will leave unseen residue behind, which will have an adverse effect on the blacktop's adhesion.

, If an area of the driveway has broken off and revealed the subsurface underneath, fill the hole with dirt, gravel, or sand until it is level with the rest of the subsurface., Put on gloves, protective eyewear, and long sleeves and trousers before handling the blacktop. Check the product label for safety instructions.

, Blacktop (asphalt) repair products come in a couple different varieties. The asphalt pothole patching material is the best choice for missing chunks of asphalt (potholes), and for depressions deeper than 2 inches (5 cm).You'll want a cold pour product for home repairs, since hot pour products require specialized machines., You can skip this step to save on labor, but the patching material will create a stronger, longer-lasting bond in a hole with vertical edges. An asphalt saw is the easiest way to achieve this, but you can use a hammer and chisel to break the edges of the hole instead.Clean away any dust and broken asphalt created by this process.

, Pour it directly from the bag until you've added a ½ to 1"" (1.25 to 2.5 cm) layer throughout the hole. For larger holes, spread the material around with a rake or shovel.It's not a problem if the material spills over onto the surrounding surface.

, Push the patching material down with a pothole tamper, vibrating plater, lawn roller, or any other heavy object.


For a large area, you can oil a piece of plywood to prevent sticking, then place it oiled side down over the patch. Drive over the plywood to compact the material underneath., Continue applying and compacting layers of patching material until the hole is level with the surrounding driveway. Using layers no thicker than 1"" (2.5cm) will help prevent air spaces from forming and weakening the repair., Applying an asphalt sealer over the repair will make it more durable. However, you can only apply the sealer in certain conditions:


Wait at least 4 hours for the patch to cure, or as directed on the label instructions.Wait until the weather is at least 60ºF (16ºC), the driveway is dry, and you don't expect rain. If the sealer gets wet before it cures, some of the patching material may be washed away., Check all product labels for safety instructions before you begin. Gloves, work clothing, and protective eyewear are all recommended.

, If you have single cracks less than ¼"" (6mm) wide, use asphalt crack filler. Check the label for application instructions or apply as follows:Shake the bottle to mix the product evenly.
Cut off the top of the nozzle so the opening is narrower than the crack. (If there is no nozzle, load the product into an asphalt caulk gun instead.)
Squeeze the filler directly into the crack until it is flush with the driveway.
Let dry for 24 hours. If the filler has sunk below the driveway surface level, apply an additional coat.
Wait at least 24 hours after the final coat before walking or driving over the repair.

, This material is intended for ""alligator scale"" or ""spiderweb"" crack patterns, single cracks wider than ¼"" (6mm), and small depressions shallower than 2"" (5cm).If the alligator cracks are severe, chunks of the asphalt may be fully separated from the driveway. You may achieve a stronger repair if you remove these entirely, then refill the hole using the pothole method above.

, Pour a little of the material onto the center of the damage. Spread it out with an asphalt squeegee (or an asphalt brush) until the damage is covered with ⅛ to ¼"" (3 to 6 mm) of material.Check the label instructions first. Some products may need to be mixed in a bucket before application.

, Spread on additional alligator patching material until the cracked area or depression is level with its surroundings.


For a more even transition, squeegee out a thin layer one or two feet (0.3 to 0.6m) in each direction.

, The material will harden over the course of a few hours, depending on climate and depth of the repair.

, Thick repairs may crack slightly over the course of a few days. Apply an additional thin coat if this happens.,"

Determine which direction the wind is blowing.,
Choose a place for the snow to build up.,
Prepare the snow blower.,
Clear off your car first.,
Make circular motions if there is no wind.,
Work side to side if there is wind.,
Shovel any remaining snow.,
Make sure pets and children are out of the area.,
Do not wear loose-fitting clothes.,
Turn off the machine when you step away from it.",How to Snow Blow Your Driveway," Before you begin snow blowing, stand outside and feel the wind against your face. When you snow blow, you should move in the direction of the wind. Snow blowing against the wind will result in snow blowing against your face while you work.If you can't tell the direction of the wind, try licking your finger and then holding in front of your face. The wetness will help you feel the wind better.;
, You need to blow the snow away from your driveway. Ideally, you should blow the snow as far into the yard as possible. Check your snow blower's capability to see how far you can blow snow using the highest setting. Plan to twist the nozzle as necessary to get the snow into the appropriate spot in your yard.Aim to blow the snow towards an unused area of your yard. Avoid blowing the snow into places like walkways or near the mailbox.
Make sure your snow blower does not blow the snow too far out. You don't want to use a setting that would blow your snow into a neighbor's yard.

, Be sure to check the condition of the snow blower before using it. You may have to make some adjustments depending on the snow blower's condition and your driveway. Check the following:


Fill the machine with fuel before starting, to avoid breaking your routine and walking back to your garage just to re-fuel. This should be done outdoors to prevent vapor build-up. Do not add fuel to a hot engine; a snow blower's engine must be cooled down first.
Check the machine's oil before every use (applies to 4 cycle engines). Snow blowers can often burn oil without smoking, and the lack of the proper amount and/or correct type of oil can kill your machine quickly.
Check the skid shoes, which are the metal pieces on the bottom of the snow blower. If you have a paved driveway, make sure the skid shoes are set to the lowest setting. For a gravel driveway, skid shoes should be set higher up to avoid displacing the gravel.

, Before you begin snow blowing, clear off your car if it's out in the driveway or parked in the street. This will prevent you from having to clear the snow around your car after snow blowing., If there is no wind, start in the center of the driveway. Keep the snow nozzle pointed outward towards the yard surrounding the driveway. Work in circles, moving outward as you go., If there is a wind, point the snow nozzle in the direction the wind blows. Start in the upward direction of the wind, moving your snow blower side to side. Move your snow chute as necessary to keep it pointed in the direction of the wind.

, While you can remove most of the snow with a snow blower, there may be small bits of snow accumulated when you finish. There may be snow stuck in tight or narrow spots in the driveway that are difficult to reach with a snow blower. Use a shovel to clear out these spots., Make sure the area is clear before you begin snow blowing. Keep your children out of the driveway and the surrounding area. Make sure pets are not near the driveway when snow blowing.If you have pets that you allow outside, keep them indoors while using the snow blower.

, Loose-fitting clothes, like loose jackets and scarves, can get caught in a snow blower and cause injury. Make sure to wear form-fitted jackets and, if you wear a scarf, make sure it's tucked into your jacket while you run your snow blower., If you need to step away from the snow blower for any reason, turn it off first. Unless you're only stepping away for a few seconds, it's important to power down the snow blower when stepping away."

Install pavers.,
Add more greenery with porous pavers.,
Pave your driveway with bricks.,
Use faux-brick asphalt.,
Lay a gravel driveway.,
Use shells instead of gravel.",How to Landscape Your Driveway1," For perhaps the widest variety of design and color options, go with paver stones. Anticipate the upfront cost to be higher than most other materials, but consider it an investment. Once it’s installed, expect it to last a good 30 to 40 years, with lower upkeep costs than most other materials.With the wide range of designs and colors, you can create even more visual appeal by planning patterns to your driveway. For instance, you can alternate between a handful of differently styled stones throughout the driveway, or create distinctive shapes within it, like white swirls or circles in an otherwise black driveway.;
, Instead of paving your driveway with solid stones, blend your lawn and driveway together by using porous pavers instead. Plant grass or other vegetation in the holes drilled out from each one. Reap the best of both worlds with a durable driveway that doesn’t entirely obscure the natural landscape underneath.This is a particularly good idea if excessive runoff from rainfall is a concern for your property, since these allow water to be absorbed directly into the ground instead of draining elsewhere.

, Punch up your property’s appearance with this colorful material. Select between a variety of colors and shades ranging in richness. Make your driveway even more eye-catching by using alternating patterns, such as creating borders with bricks placed lengthwise while filling the space in between with bricks placed widthwise.Like pavers, bricks are one of the more costly materials to install, but they are also highly durable and require only moderate maintenance, so most of the cost is upfront.

, If you love the look of brick, but feel daunted by the upfront cost, don’t worry. Instead of using the real thing, pave your driveway with asphalt that has been designed to imitate brick’s appearance. Save approximately half the money that it would take to lay down a real brick driveway while still gaining its curb appeal.Although the cost of installing asphalt is lower than brick, keep in mind that it will require resealing every few years, so you will need to budget for regular maintenance., To add a more rustic feel to your home, opt for gravel. Choose between a wide variety of colors to accent your home’s exterior paint. However, be aware that the cost of upkeep for a gravel driveway could negate the initial savings of this low-cost material, since the gravel will remain loose and could therefore be displaced over time.Gravel is a better option if you live in a relatively dry climate with little to no heavy precipitation. If your area receives heavy and/or frequent snow or rain, you’re more likely to lose a substantial amount over time.
Similarly, if your driveway is steeply graded, the gravel is more likely to wash away as water pushes it downward.

, If you like the idea of loose gravel, but want to add a more nautical touch to your driveway, go with shells. Select between a variety of natural shades ranging from off-white to darker tones and colors like gray or brown. If you’re concerned about the environment, be sure to research the sourcing of the products you find to make sure they’re sourced responsibly. Varieties include:Clam
Oyster
Scallop

Determine which method is the most desirable: direct burial of cable under soil, PVC electrical pipe (PVC) buried under soil with conductors installed in pipe, or aerial method.,
Direct burial of type ""UF"" cable under soil is probably the most common and least expensive method.,
After ensuring the minimum depth along the entire length, lay type ""UF"" cable in the trench.,
UF cable must be supported every 30–36 inches (76.2–91.4 cm); just like NM cable.,Do NOT backfill the trench until the electrical inspector or ""authority having jurisdiction"" (AHJ) has checked the work.,
PVC pipe method allows for adding circuits at will without the labor or expense of excavating again.,
A trench 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep minimum will be required for the pipe.,Secure the pipe where it rises above ground at 30 to 36 inches (76.2 to 91.4 cm) intervals with approved supports for the pipe.,Do NOT backfill the trench until the wiring inspector has checked your work.,
A PVC ""expansion joint"" is often required between the point the pipe emerges from the ground outdoors and penetrates a wall or enters an enclosure mounted on the wall.,
Push the ""fish tape"" or ""snake"" in one end of the pipe until it exits the opposite end.,
Hook the conductors to the snake and tape together.,
Aerial installations should only be done for short lateral runs, and where they may be installed so that traffic (vehicle or pedestrian) below will not create a hazard by contact.,
Type UF cable is suitable for an aerial run when used with approved strain relief fittings because Type UF cable is rated as / and accepted to be sunlight & moisture resistant.",How to Install Outdoor Electric Wiring," Each has its own benefits and detractors. Please read the entire article to help you decide which method will work best for you.
, It provides for hot(s), neutral and grounding conductors all inside a durable, sunlight and moisture resistant encasement or ""jacket"". UF type cable looks very similar to ""NM"" (Romex) cable, but differs in that the individual conductors are ""flooded"" with the jacket material found on NM cable. Thus, there is no thin, easy-to-remove outer jacket like NM cable, but rather the conductors and their insulation must be removed from the ""jacket"" (learning to do this may take a little time - practice with left over cable before attempting on installed cable). Direct burial cable requires at least an 18 inch (45.7 cm) deep trench in earth between the origin and termination of the lateral run. Most trenches should be dug to a depth that is below the frost line. Check with your inspector in your area to determine the minimum depth required., Place smooth rocks on top of the cable to keep any high spots down., It does not need to be supported in the trench. This cable must be supported when run over concrete. This can be accomplished by securing wood (pressure treated if exposed to outdoors) to concrete and then securing the cable to the wood. If the cable may be subjected to physical damage, it should be ""sleeved"" in ""Schedule 80"" PVC pipe and terminated with proper pipe fittings (couplings, ""LB"" fittings, clips, expansion joints, etc).,, By installing pipe a size or two larger than required for the current project, or providing a 2nd pipe at the same time, there will be enough room to pull in additional conductors later. Speed future installations by always leaving an extra ""pull wire"" or string for use to connect either a rope or directly to a new cable when the time comes to expand the number of circuits. Multiple pipes must provided for other services - low voltage and signal services such as: communication (telephone or network), cable TV, satellite television, intercom, etc. services are not permitted in pipes that contain power. These cables must either be installed in a separate pipe or buried directly within a cable labeled as suitable for direct burial in earth. It should be obvious that there is a great deal of flexibility offered by the (multiple) pipe method., Use ""Schedule 40"" for the portion under soil, and ""Schedule 80"" for those portions of the pipe run above ground. Layout the pipe run adjacent to the trench. Make sure you have a ""snake"" or fish tape long enough to go from end to end. Glue the pipe together with approved fittings and adhesives. Place the pipe into the trench.,,, Expansion joints allow for changes in grade that can result from frost heaves and must be employed where required. Check your local code for this requirement. Expansion joints are available at most home centers that sell PVC electrical pipe., Protect any existing wires from damage from the snake by placing cardboard or other insulator between the snake and wires at the opening of the pipe. Steel snakes will conduct electricity if allowed to rub through insulation of an energized wire, so shut off power if possible before installing the snake or pulling wire., Have a helper ""feed"" and guide the wires as you withdraw the snake from the pipe. Do not pull fast or hard; slow and steady tension is the key. Do not allow the new wires to constantly rub existing wires in the same place as they are pulled into the pipe, as doing so they may wear away insulation and expose harmful voltages present on the conductor(s) when energized., Additional clearance requirements must be observed when passing over roofs or near windows and doors., The strain relief and support fittings should be secured to the building framing members, not just to plywood sheathing of the structures. These fittings are seldom found in home centers, but are available at most full-line electrical distributors. This wiring method should be used only if the other two are not suitable. Keep in mind that these cables will stretch a bit when under high electric load or in direct sunlight. They will also be strained under the weight of snow and ice build up, and could break mid-span or rip from supports."

, If you have just bought a home, the experts recommend living with it for a year to see what you like and don’t like about your yard. You will get a chance to see what areas are shaded, sunny and windy., These may include a play area, vegetable garden, rose garden, fire pit, porch or trees. Ensure that everyone in your family agrees on these features.

, You can hire a landscaping consultant/architect to plan it out, or you can hire a landscaping contractor to execute your design. A consultant will usually charge $100 to $150 per hour for their time.If you don’t have the money in your budget to hire a professional, consider hiring them for anything with large tools or heavy rocks. You can save a lot of money by landscaping it yourself slowly over several years.

, Home and Garden websites and magazines are also a great place to look. Print out or post ideas on a board so that you can return to them as you plan.

, Include rocks, trees, plants, flowers and paths as well as structures. Then, number them in order of priority and importance. Use the Plan-a-Garden application at Better Homes and Gardens to sketch out your home if you aren’t able to sketch it to your liking.

, Choose one area to splurge on and then save on the less important features., For many people this is a priority in their landscaping. The most common ways are through fences and shrubs or trees.

, Get a bid from a contractor that can also supply the materials. It may be only slightly more than doing it yourself.

, Look for a good supplier of trees and then enrich the soil before you plant. It’s a good idea to plant trees at least 30 feet (9.1 m) from your foundation.


Planting trees to shade and shelter your house can save up to 25 percent on your home energy bills. Energy.gov provides tips on how to landscape for energy efficiency by region.Request trees from your city. They may provide the plants for free if you provide the maintenance.

, You can create a structure on which creeping vines can grow. Since many of these vines are fast growing (and invasive), they can fill out in just a few years.

, Choose a place where it is shaded from the sun and not too exposed to the wind, so that you can be comfortable there. Most people try to offset this area from the house.

, You may want to dig in the posts and pour concrete to make them more safe and sturdy.

, You can pour concrete, use paving stones or lay bricks.

, If your landscape includes hills or uneven ground, you can have a professional contractor install retaining walls so that you can work the soil on several levels, while making the hills more attractive. It is a good idea to ask a professional for help with leveling and terracing a hillside.

, In most cases, water features require retaining walls to keep the water from running off into other areas. A water feature should be carefully planned and executed, since poor plumbing and planning can result in problems for the house and the yard.

, If you don’t have the time or money to maintain a lawn, then you can cover the area with rocks, gravel or stones in areas. Make sure to compare quotes from contractors and home improvement stores, including delivery and installation.


Inquire about collecting rocks and stones from demolition sites. If you can collect and deliver them yourself, they may even be free.

,, You will need to enrich clay and gravel filled soils with compost and other materials.

, Provide your own rich soil by composting kitchen scraps, grass clippings, leaves and more. Place cisterns below your drain pipes so that you can gather rainwater for plants.


Home water bills are usually 20 percent of your water use. Saving rainwater can cut your water bill by 15 percent.

, Succulents, native grasses and wildflowers are good choices if you are in drought areas or if you want to save money. Visit sites like plantnative.org to find a list of native plants that are bound to thrive in your area.

, Trucks may need to deliver materials to your yard, which can rip up grass.

, Don’t invest in annuals until you have the money to replace them every year.

, Ensure you have the right kind of sunlight to help the plants thrive, or you will be wasting your money by buying plants. For example, hostas require full shade, while most flowers require full sun.

, A landscape usually doesn’t include full-sized plants. Use one-gallon plants and allow them to fill in.


This will save you money in the long run and you are less likely to end up with plants that refuse to grow or thrive.

, Vines, groundcover plants and perennials may be able to use small cuttings from larger plants. You can also divide your own well-established plants, like hostas, and plant them in other areas around the yard.

Install fencing.,
Line your driveway with ornamental trees.,
Plant shrubs.,
Lay a flower bed.,
Add something distinctive to curves.",How to Landscape Your Driveway2," Line either side or both sides of your driveway with a low fence that matches the aesthetic of your home’s exterior. For more flexibility in your property’s appearance, select materials that can painted, like wood or vinyl. Enhance your landscaping even further by painting the fence a new color.Fencing also allows you to add more elements, like hanging lanterns or flower baskets, after installation.
Being able to repaint your fence can help you update your borders' accents to complement your home if you repaint the exterior a new color.

, If you don’t like the idea of limiting access to the driveway from the lawn, but still want to make a bold statement with vibrant colors, go with this option. Plant the same species of ornamental tree along your driveway, or create a pattern by alternating between species.The best kind to use will vary depending on your climate and region, but popular choices include:Cornus Mas
Eastern Redbud
Japanese Tree or Dwarf Korean Lilac
Kousa Dogwood
Serviceberry

, If ornamental trees would be too tall or crowded to suit your driveway, but you’d still like both a substantial and natural border for it, opt for shrubs instead. Also choose these if you’d like to tie the driveway into your home that much more by extending the shrub border around your home as well. Add even more pizazz by using the shrubs as topiary and trimming them into eye-catching designs.As with trees, region and climate will determine what type of shrub is best for your area. Popular choices, though, include burkwood viburnum, India hawthorn, and “Pallida” Chinese witch hazel., If you’d prefer your border to use color rather than height to draw attention to your driveway, line it with flowers instead of shrubs, trees, or fences. Define the edges of your driveway with plants that catch the eye. Use this technique to divide your driveway from the rest of your lawn without seriously hindering accessibility from one to the other. However, remember that this a high-traffic area, so keep in mind that:Vegetables can be just as colorful as flowers, but since whatever you plant here will be exposed to lots of car exhaust, don’t plant anything you intend to eat.
Opting for durable ground cover plants (like blue star creeper or Corsican mint) is a better idea than planting fragile flowers, since it’s always possible for a car to go off track and roll over your flower bed., If you have a curved driveway, keep in mind that the eye is naturally drawn toward to the curve(s) when viewing the driveway as a whole. Utilize this tendency by placing a unique design element there to punch up your property’s appearance that much more. Options include:Planting a tree or shrub.
Starting a water or rock garden.
Adding a wishing well or other lawn decorations.

Consider your home’s aesthetic.,
Choose the right material for your climate and region.,
Keep upkeep in mind.",How to Landscape Your Driveway3," Think of your driveway as one element in a larger picture, rather than its own canvas that’s entirely separate from the others. Use your home’s architectural style as a starting point and from there decide which ideas will complement that. Landscaping your driveway can be a huge investment of time and/or money, so avoid making impulsive decisions on design ideas that may end up clashing with your property’s overall aesthetic.For instance, gravel driveways may be more fitting for rustic or rural architecture, while pavers or brick would complement classic designs.

, Be aware that weather can have a huge impact on your driveway’s longevity. Whether it’s the driveway material or the vegetation used for borders, always research the product to find out if it’s well suited for your area. Moisture and freezing temperatures are two primary concerns in both instances, so definitely look into how well a given product will stand up to your region’s average precipitation, humidity, and freeze-thaw cycles.As an example, concrete is pretty susceptible to heavy damage if you experience heavy freeze-thaw cycles, while asphalt is more durable in these conditions.

, Whether you’re installing a new driveway or sprucing up your existing one, remember that what you choose to add to your property may require extended work long after the installation is done. For each option you’re considering, remember to factor in how much time and money it will cost you in the long run, not just upfront. Research the product’s durability as well as the labor and budget required to maintain your landscape, and then consider whether you’re willing to commit to it."

Excavate the area where the pavers will be installed.,
Fill the excavated area with gravel.,
Lay the pavers into place.,
Backfill the remaining space with topsoil.,
Spread grass seed over the topsoil.,
Water the grass until it is established.",How to Grow Grass Between Pavers," Use a spade to dig a hole underneath where the pavers will lie. This hole should be about 5 inches (12 cm) deep, but can be shallower. Place the excavated soil aside in a convenient location. If your topsoil layer is shallower than the hole you dug, keep the excavated topsoil and subsoil separate. You will need the topsoil later for backfilling.;
, Use a shovel to apply a layer of gravel into the excavated hole. The gravel layer should ideally be about 4 inches (10 cm) deep, but will be still be effective at only an inch or so of depth. Smooth the gravel with your shovel after applying it.


The gravel dramatically improves drainage underneath the pavers. This will keep them from becoming flooded or being pushed up by the saturated soil underneath. It will also prevent the growth of unwanted plants.
If you want your pavers to sit flush with the surrounding ground, don't fill the hole all the way up with gravel. Leave enough space for the pavers to rest on top.

, Seat the pavers onto the gravel base in their desired locations. You can tap the pavers down firmly using a rubber mallet. Alternatively, you can add a shallow layer of sand on top of the gravel into which to seat the pavers.

, After the pavers are positioned correctly, use topsoil to fill in the remaining space between them. The topsoil excavated at the beginning of the process will be more than enough to fill in the gaps.

, You can scatter the grass seed with your hand. Make sure to achieve full coverage over all of the areas between the pavers. After spreading the grass seed, you can either work the seeds into the soil with your hands or spread an additional thin layer of topsoil over them.

, Initially, the topsoil should be watered until damp. Water it in both the morning and evening just enough until it is slightly moist. After the grass germinates and begins to grow, reduce watering to once a day. Once established, it can be watered on the same schedule as the rest of your lawn.

Make sure that there are no missing tiles and that the roof is sealed everywhere. A fresh coat of roof paint is never a bad idea. Also check the gutters making sure there are no blockages or cracks.;
, If there are wooden gates a fresh coat of varnish will make them look as good as new. If you have electrical gates make sure they are operating properly. Check the rails of the gates and keep them free of obstruction such as grass or plants that are on the way. Iron or steel gates also need a fresh coat of paint every now and again.

, Make sure there are no cracks or chips. Wooden frames should be varnished or painted to make sure the wood does not rot or chip. You may consider adding shutters above window frames to protect the wood from the damaging effects of the sun.

, Use the correct paint for your outside walls as this will last a good couple of years. All you need is a good roller brush and paint. With some patience this chore can be done by yourself.

, Varnish or paint them as required. The hinges may need to be oiled or greased if they are creaky and movement of the doors become restricted.

Choose your grade.,
Rig up some shade, if there is an existing structure.,
Remove the sod.,
Use a laser level and stakes (if there are no existing posts) to pinpoint your exact grade throughout the site.,
Start cutting out the back.,

Move the loose dirt over to the low side.,
Build the retaining wall if there's fill within the structure to hold back.,

Rake out the grade and tamp.,
Here is the final grade, after the driveway was begun:

",How to Grade a Site by Hand," There are three ways to go here. Either cut straight back into the hillside, and use retaining walls behind the structure to hold the earth back. Or put retaining walls around the lower side of the site, and build up with fill. You will be ordering at least a truckload of dirt here (not that costly, under a $100), and once it's in, it will need a month or so to properly settle. Usually heavy rains will do the trick. The last option is to split the difference - choose a final grade midway between the low and high elevation of the slope. You will need a lot of retaining wall here, both around the low side of the structure, as well as behind it to hold back where you cut out. But with this option you will not be paying for dirt nor waiting for it to settle, and only digging half as much back into the slope.;
, Grading is hard work and it's easy to get overheated. A tarp of this size will need nailed down or heavy objects laid across the top to keep it from flying off in the wind. Merely tying it down along the edges will cause the grommets to rip out.

, The key low-tech tool here is the spading fork. It's like a mini-pitchfork (about $15). Lunge at the root-base of the sod, pry around, and yank. Heap all the sod up into a wheelbarrow, and cart it off to any barren spot on your land. Even if the sod doesn't establish itself (it will need heavy watering in the beginning to do so), it will at least help rebuild the soil.

, Mark where the final grade will be with masking tape.

, Use a heavy-duty pick/mattock - the heaviest pick you can comfortably swing down with from above your head. Use the mattock end to break up the soil. At the end of your stroke you can pull the dirt towards you and up out of where you're digging. There's a lot of technique to swinging a pick. With the right stroke you can 'pop' quite a large hunk of soil loose. Any rocks you encounter can be used in your foundation. Try swinging the pick from the side and other motions to use different muscle groups.

, Shovel the dirt into a wheelbarrow and dump and tamp it using a hand tamper ($20). If you're simply trying to build the grade on the low side, not much tamping is necessary. A good heavy rain will settle your fill. Final tamping will be done after the grade is level and raked out.

, The retaining wall can double as a stem wall.

, Lay boards across your grade with a 4' to 6' level to get everything smooth and even. The tamping is not that critical if the site will be exposed to the weather for a while. All the hand-tamping in the world will not compare to the settling effect you will get after several rains.

Begin work.,
Seperate suitable fill materials as you grade your site.,

Compact the subgrade you have established in leveling your site.,
Add fill dirt in lifts to reach your desired grade.,
Grade the building pad using a builder's level or laser level or string lines to make sure it is within the desired tolerance (in respect to being level).",How to Grade and Prepare Soil for Building Projects," There are three things you need to carefully consider before beginning your site work.


Determine the property boundaries and encroachments such as underground utilities so you can legally proceed.
Determine if you will need permits and how clearing or modifying the grade will impact stormwater runoff and/or possible soil erosion.
Lay out the exact foot print of the area you plan to clear and grade.;
,  In some jurisdictions, grading projects may require permits, including stormwater management districts, zoning authorities, even your state or local department of the environment. For some sites, permits may be required from federal agencies like the U.S. EPA.

, Merchantable timber may be sold, and logging companies may agree to purchase such timber, as well as removing stumps from large trees with their equipment, saving you lots of money and sweat.

, Once you begin clearing, maintaining access can be critical to successfully completing the project. Marking and maintaining a travel corridor should be done early in the process.

, Geotechnical Engineers can investigate soil and subgrade conditions to determine whether they are suitable for building. Things like soil bearing, demucking, soil stabilization, and the permeability of the site may need consideration. Hauling out unsuitable fill and hauling in suitable fill dirt can cost a fortune, spending money on engineering services before beginning may save a lot, even on a small project.

, You should have a grasp of the scope of your project if you have followed the previous steps. Usually, the first step of action grading and preparing soils for a building project involves clearing and grubbing. This means removing trees and vegetation, then grubbing out roots, organic materials, large rocks, and other impediments.

, Some sites can be balanced, by scraping away topsoil and debris, then using existing subgrade material to level the site.  Depending on your soil geology, you may have layers of sand, clay, gravel, or other soils/materials that can be stockpiled during clearing and placed back in a later step.

, Most often, unusable materials like limbs, roots, and other things should be removed or disposed of as soon as they are cleared. In some locations, burning is an economical option, but if it isn't practical or permitted in your area, go ahead and get rid of them so they don't become a breeding ground for pests.

, This can be done by setting grade stakes or putting up batter boards with string lines so you can see how much additional material needs to be removed or hauled into your site.

, This is the purpose of setting the grades in the previous step.  Once the area is leveled, you can calculate the amount (if any) of additional fill material you will need.  For a building slab, plan on filling the backslope adjacent to the slab to the required grade, particularly if you are hauling a substantial amount of fill dirt for the slab itself.

, Proof rolling with a piece of heavy equipment is often used for this purpose, but a mechanical tamp or motorized tamp machine or compactor may be used, depending on how large the site is.  A soil density report by a testing laboratory may be required at this point, check with your local zoning/inspection agency if you are building a permitted structure.

, Placing layers of fill dirt, usually 6-8 inches deep, and compacting each layer is a normal procedure.  For dry or sandy material, wetting the fill dirt often improves compaction, but for non draining soils like clay, keep from drenching your fill material.

, Usually, a fine grade of plus or minus 1/2 inch is acceptable.

Determine if you need to have a survey done.,
Contact several local surveying firms to get cost estimates.,
Compare the estimates from the surveyors you contacted.,
Select a surveyor.,
Allow the surveyor to perform the survey.",How to Get a Land Survey," There are 6 situations in which a land survey should be performed.


Get a survey done if you are buying a new piece of property. The reason is simple: you need to make sure that what you think you're buying is actually what you're buying. Most lenders will require a survey anyway.
Get a survey done if you are constructing anything new on your property. Most zoning ordinances and neighborhood codes will specify a required setback from your property line. If you don't know precisely where your property line is, you won't be able to adhere to this regulation.
Get a survey done if your property has any access easements. All property owners are entitled to access their property, and this often requires getting easements to allow the use of a neighboring land parcel for access. Easements should specify very clearly the centerline and width of any access corridors.
Get a survey done if you are selling your property. Having a current survey on file will greatly improve the marketability of your home. Buyers will be more interested in your property if you give them the confidence that a proper survey has been performed.
Get a survey done if you need to verify the acreage of your property for tax assessments. Your local jurisdiction may require you to have a current survey on file to correctly assess property taxes.
Get a survey done if your neighbor starts building anything new. If you suspect your neighbor is encroaching on your property or violating setback regulations, you need a survey on your own property to initiate any legal action.;
, Have your deed ready, because surveyors will generally not give an estimate unless they have a copy of your deed. Explain the reason why you need a survey and any other concerns you might have.

, Good surveying firms will do their research before providing a bid. Make sure that they've checked for any previous surveys done on your property by government offices or private surveyors. Surveys will cost less if some of the boundaries can be quickly verified through previous surveys.

, When you're happy with a company's bid, sign the contract included with the bid and return it to the company. You will generally have to pay a retainer fee at this point. Make sure that you clearly understand how long it will take the surveyor to complete the survey before contracting with them.

, When the job is done, you should receive a signed certificate from them certifying that the survey has been recorded.

Get permits and check regulations.,
Harvest any large trees that are on your land.,
Use a bulldozer to completely clear an area of land after it is harvested.",How to Clear Land1," Look online or contact local, county, state, and federal offices to find out what is allowed and what isn’t. Some areas regulate land clearing extensively and require several different kinds of permits, and others are much more relaxed. Be sure that you’re aware of the rules and plan to follow them., Before you bring in a bulldozer, hire a professional to cut down any large trees that are in good shape. These trees can be sold for lumber.


Rocks, gravel, and plants on the land can also have monetary value.

, The bulldozer can then push away debris from the harvesting, and the bulldozer will push over stumps and fairly small trees and bushes.


Bulldozing is a cheaper method of clearing land. However, the topsoil of your land will be damaged during the process. Topsoil is lost when it attaches itself to the roots of the stumps that are pushed away.
The debris pushed away by the bulldozer has to go somewhere. If you choose the bulldozing method, you will have huge piles of debris. This can be an eyesore that is hard to get rid of. Condense your wood debris by using a wood chipping machine. You can try burning the debris, but it will first have to dry for several months and may not burn well because of all of the dirt mixed in. Also consider burying the pile of debris. This will require having a place to bury it and possibly also a permit.

Call the municipal government to verify digging the area is safe.,

Send your soil to a landfill.",How to Dig a Hole," Whenever you are digging, you must always first consult your local utilities authority about the underground utilities layout, especially if you live in a suburban or even semi-rural area. Digging into the layout isn't just disruptive but potentially lethal if your shovel comes in contact with anything electrical. Even in the mildest cases, a lot of hassle can be bypassed if you contact the proper authorities first. Remember the words: ""Call before you dig.""Note that this is a free service.
If you are in the US, call 811. This will connect you with the Nationwide Dig line , which can connect you with a local team. They will give you a work ticket reference number and let you know when you can expect the inspection to take place. You'll need to mark the area where you plan to dig with white paint.
If you're looking for the right number to call, you can search online: ""dig hole"" and your city or municipality. The proper authority should come up in the first or second listing.;
, If your hole is going to be any bigger than a post, it is good to first have an outline of how big you'd like the hole to be. Without a line, diggers have the tendency to miscalculate how big their finished hole should be. With a can of white marking spray paint, spray the area you would like to have dug up. Be generous with the size; it's usually better to have a hole that's slightly too big than one too small for your needs.


If you're digging post holes, you should run a straight string along the area you'd like to see fenced and spray markers or drive marker stakes into the ground at consistent intervals across the line.

, Due to how many different types and sizes of holes can be dug, there's no all-encompassing list to turn to if you want to know what equipment you'll need. However, for virtually all kinds of holes, a shovel is necessary. While most of the work may be one with a shovel, other instruments may speed up the process. Though you may want to get the biggest tools available for efficiency's sake, you should choose tools that make sense for your body size. An appropriately-sized tool will keep you from tiring out quickly, thus improving efficiency in the long run.


A shovel and mattock are good for regular holes. Get your hands on a posthole digger if you need to make holes for a new fence.
You should also consider how you're going to deal with the displaced soil. If you're putting the soil back in the hole once you've dug it up, you can shovel it back. Putting a tarp next to the hole will give you a clean place to place soil. Use a wheelbarrow to dispose of larger amounts of soil.
If you plan on setting a post in concrete, have the mix, water, and mixer nearby. You'll also want two stakes of wood and two lengths of wood (1""x4""x5' or so) for cross-bracing and screws or Duplex nails for fastening.

, Only dig by hand if you need to. Digging can be a very physically strenuous activity, and you will be better off if you are able to do it with the help of a machine. For the sake of making postholes for example, you can rent and use a power auger.


Power augers are used much like a lawnmower. It is a better idea to rent one than buy one yourself. Depending on the inventory of your local hardware store, you should probably have a choice between a one or two-man power auger. Base your decisions around the size and amount of holes you need to make. Talk to someone at the hardware store if you're unsure about the details.
If you have to dig many holes (like for a fence), a two-person auger is your best pet. Augers can be extremely difficult for one person to handle and can even be dangerous if you are not familiar with the equipment.
Rocky and heavy clay ground can be difficult to dig, even with a gas-powered auger. Get a good digging rock bar and post-hole diggers to help with this type of soil.
Follow all safety guidelines when operating any machine. Avoid loose-fitting clothing and wear leather boots and eye and ear protection when operating.

, Digging can be made very difficult if you're having to dig in rainy weather. If your hole is large enough, rain will eventually pool up at the bottom of your hole, which can pose its own challenges depending on the type and depth of hole you're going for. Moreover, it goes without saying that yard work is more enjoyable when it's done in reasonably good weather. Waiting for a good day is ultimately optional but it will have a major effect on the way you experience the work.


Frozen soil is very difficult to work with, so it's best to dig in months without extreme weather.

, Instead of going straight in with a shovel, you will save time and effort if you prep the area first with a mattock. A mattock is specifically designed to pierce topsoil and rip out roots. For the most part, you'll find the most resistance to your digging at the top. Once you break through the surface level, you can switch to a shovel and let the grunt work commence.


A good steel digging bar with a point in one end and flat or pry point on other end works well also. Especially if you must dig deeper than 6"" to 8"", which a Mattock cannot do.
If you don't have a mattock, using a spade to tear up the sod will suffice as well.

, Once you've broken the topsoil, it comes to the grunt phase of getting the soil out of the hole. This may be a short step, or quite intensive, all depending on how big you want the hole to be. While you are shovelling, it's a good idea to shovel the perimeter first, and shovel inwards from there. That way, you'll have a set perimeter, and won't be making the hole any bigger than you need to.


Wear heavy boots when shoveling dirt. Step firmly and straight down on the shovel. Rock and wiggle the shovel side to side and forward to back to loosen the dirt and help the shovel go in.
As with depth, it is better to err on a the side of a hole being too big than too small.

, It's important to keep a tidy workspace in most situations, and digging a hole is no different. Having your disposal pile next to the hole is preferable, as it minimizes the turnover time between shovelling loads of soil. Just make sure it's not so close that it will fall back in the hole. If the project is big enough, it's a good idea to offload the shovel loads directly into a wheelbarrow. Once the wheelbarrow is full, you can offload it somewhere further away and bring it back for more.

, Keep a 25-foot tape measurer handy while digging, or mark your desired depth on a stake you can use to measure the depth of the hole. Only measure the hole once you have cleaned out all the dirt., A tarp is not necessary, but it helps a great deal with the cleanup. Placing the dug-up dirt on a tarp will reduce the mess caused by a lot of errant soil. Depending on the amount of soil you have to dig up, you can wrap up the tarp into a sack and carry it to the organic garbage as such, or shovel it back.

, If you have a lot of soil and have nowhere for it to go (for instance, you already used some to amend your plant beds but you have quite a bit of soil left), there are probably others in your neighbourhood who could use it for their own landscaping projects. Putting an ad up somewhere like Craigslist is your best bet. There are obviously no guarantees whether someone will respond to your ad, but it is a way to get rid of your soil for free, all the while helping out a stranger while you're at it.

, If you have enough excess soil from your digging operation and have nowhere to put it, you can send it to a landfill as 'clean fill'.You can send this excess to a landfill provided the soil has not been contaminated and meets your municipality's minimum sanitary requirements. The particulars will depend on where you're living, but you can usually find specific details on your home city's webpage.


Keep in mind that you may be charged a fee for disposing of your soil in a landfill.

Seek out a mulch clearing company.",How to Clear Land2," Check to see if anyone in your area owns and runs a mulching machine. This method is good if you have an area to clear with smaller trees, 8 inches (20 cm) or less, or an area that needs to be cleared around trees.


A mulch machine knocks over small trees, bushes, and brush and grinds them into mulch. There is nothing left to pile up or burn.
This type of clearing is also good if you want to clear around large trees. Some mulching machines are small and will fit between trees.
Mulch clearing is more expensive than other kinds of clearing. The mulching machine works very fast and is a quick way to clear land. Larger mulching machines cost more per hour but work faster clearing land.

Know that mold is essentially caused by moisture.,
Call a professional if the mold growth is over 10 square feet.,
Consider throwing away absorbent or porous materials.,
Don't paint over or caulk a moldy surface.,
Wear proper gear when cleaning.",How to Remove Mold and Mildew1," Mold is a moisture problem. If you clean up your mold but don't solve your moisture problem, you're just inviting mold to come back at a later date. Clean and dry water-logged or water-damaged areas within 24 hours to prevent mold from growing.Mold often presents itself in bathrooms (because of showers) and kitchens (because of sinks). Be sure to wipe away excess water on your sink and open windows in a bathroom after showering.;
, If you're dealing with some serious mold — over 10 square feet worth — it's best to call a professional for removal and cleanup.Professionals will be able to use highly-effective cleaning agents and will have the proper protection against spore inhalation.








, Absorbent or porous materials, such as drywall or ceiling tiles, may need to be discarded if the mold damage is severe enough. Because mold can fill the tiny cracks and pores of these materials, it may be difficult to remove the mold completely. Cleaning, in this instance, will only temporarily inhibit mold growth; unless you remove the surface from your home completely, mold will keep coming back.








, This is a band-aid treatment, and an ineffective one at that. Surfaces such as walls or tiles that have been painted or caulked over won't take paint or caulk very well; paint or caulk will simply peel off because it doesn't have a clean surface to adhere to.









Make sure you clean and disinfect a moldy area completely before painting or caulking. Wipe away excess moisture and wait a day or two before painting of caulking, just to be sure.

, Because mold contains spores, which are air-borne particles, it's very important to wear proper protection when cleaning moldy surfaces. In most cases, mold is harmless, but there are many different types of mold, some of which can become a health hazard in intense cases. Be sure to wear:









An N-95 respirator. These are available at hardware stores across the country for relatively cheap.
Goggles, to protect your eyes from spore interaction.
Gloves.

,, Label the bottle so that you know what the contents are, especially if you intend on storing it for reuse.

, Leave it overnight. It needs this time for the clove oil to react with the mold spores.

, Allow to air dry, such as on the clothes line; a bit of sunshine will also do it some good.

, After washing, simply rehang it. It should now be clean and mold-free again.

Repeat.",How to Remove Mold and Mildew Stains from Vinyl Siding," Malfunctioning gutters, running water problems, and malfunctioning or misplaced sprinklers can all promote the growth and spread of mold and mildew. Address these issues to minimize the likelihood of having to deal with them again after you’ve cleaned your siding.;
, Before you begin cleaning, see to it that electric units on and near the walls you are about to clean are turned off or unplugged. Cover outlets, sockets, and lighting to prevent electrocution and electrical malfunction.

, You can try a number of proven DIY and commercial cleaning solutions on your siding. A popular homemade option is to mix three (3) parts distilled white vinegar with seven (7) parts water in a bucket. If you prefer a commercial product, mix one (1) part bleach with four (4) parts water.

, Get a long-handled soft-bristle brush and dip it into the cleaning solution. Gently scrub any visible stain and mildew spots, working from top to bottom.

, Pour the cleaning solution into a power washer. If you are worried about damaging the vinyl, you may use a lower-pressure pump sprayer. Begin by spraying a 5-foot wide section of the siding, from the ground to the top. Remember not to angle the sprayer upward to keep the solution from seeping under the siding layers. Instead, aim the sprayer in such a way that the solution is sprayed from above. Using a ladder may help you achieve a more even application.

, Pour whatever solution remains in the sprayer back in the bucket. Rinse the sprayer and refill it with clean water. Rinse the solution off of the vinyl, starting from the top so the water will run downward.

, Do steps 4 to 6 on the next 5-foot portion of your siding. Continue doing this until you have cleaned the entire wall.

Try a mixture of bleach and warm water.,
Use vinegar.,
Use a borax solution to kill and inhibit mold growth.,
Make good use of ammonia.,
Try using baking soda, either in a paste or by itself.,
Make use of hydrogen peroxide.",How to Remove Mold and Mildew2," Mix one cup of bleach for every gallon of warm water.Grab a medium-bristled brush, dip it in the bleach solution, and attack the mold or mildew stain. Be sure to dry the surface off as much as possible, as moisture promotes mold and mildew growth.









For harder-to-reach places, put the bleach solution in small spray bottle first. Apply the bleach solution directly to the mold or mildew by spraying. Then attack with the brush as normal.
This solution is best used mold or mildew present in bathrooms, kitchens, and other household rooms with tiles or non-porous surfaces.
Bleach is very effective at killing mold and mold spores. The active ingredient in bleach, sodium hypochlorite, is also the main ingredient in many mold-removal products. However, bleach will often simply remove the color from a mold patch, leaving it still present, but invisible.

, Pour undiluted white or apple cider vinegar into a spray bottle. Spray the moldy surface with the vinegar and wash affected area thoroughly with a brush. Dry area completely.









Use the vinegar solution only on non-porous surfaces such as tiles — not on wood.
Unlike bleach, vinegar is non-toxic and does not give off heady fumes. A mild acid, vinegar is said to be about 80% effective at destroying mold, mildew, and their respective particles.

, Mix about one cup borax for every gallon of warm water. Dip a brush into the borax solution and attack any mold growths vigorously. Wipe away excess borax and water with a clean rag.









Use borax only on non-porous surfaces. Tiled bathrooms and kitchens take borax better than wood surfaces do.
Although borax is toxic if ingested, it is a natural cleaning product that doesn't give off fumes and shouldn't contain additional chemicals. It is effective at both killing existing mold and preventing future mold growth.

, First, make sure the product you use says ""clear ammonia."" Next, mix one part clear ammonia with one part water and pour into a small spray bottle. Hit moldy and mildewy surfaces with the ammonia solution, scrubbing away. Wipe away excess ammonia with a clean towel afterwards.










Make sure you never mix ammonia and bleach. Ammonia and bleach, when mixed, create a toxic chemical called chlorine gas.It is harmful if ingested, even by fume.
For extra-tough mold or mildew stains, spray the surface with ammonia and let stand for several hours before scrubbing and wiping away.

, Baking soda is both mild — meaning it's safe for your entire family and pets — and effective. It is renowned as a gentle household cleaner and helps deodorize (no wonder it's used as a deodorant). It can be used in two basic ways:









Mixed with water and vinegar. Apply two tablespoons of baking soda to eight ounces of water and mix thoroughly. Pour into spray bottle and attack moldy surface, such as bathroom tiles. Take another spray bottle filled with vinegar and spray over the same surface. (This should create a chemical reaction creates carbon dioxide.) Vinegar is often used along with baking soda because it kills a different species of mold.
Apply baking soda directly to moldy surfaces. This works especially well on porous surfaces such as wooden furniture or drywall. Allow the sodium bicarbonate to penetrate the damp surface and then wipe away.

, Find a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution and add undiluted to a spray bottle. Spray the moldy surface with the hydrogen peroxide, let wait for at least 10 minutes, and then scrub off.Wipe away excess moisture to prevent mold from resurfacing.









Hydrogen peroxide is a great alternative to bleach and other stronger cleaning solutions that give off heavy fumes and happen to be toxic. Hydrogen peroxide is also effective at removing stains caused by mold infestations.
Hydrogen peroxide can be used on a variety of surfaces. It can safely be used on clothes, floors, fixtures, walls, and even appliances. Just make sure to spot-test any areas before attacking them at scale, as peroxide can bleach clothing and other surfaces.

Make sure you do this outside so that you do not spread the mold to other parts of your house. Next, wash the clothing. (If desired, soak it in a bleach or stain-removal solution first. Dry the clothing in the sun.









If your clothing is not washable, take it to the dry cleaners and show them the stain. Ask them if they can't remove the mold or mildew.

, Use a brush to scrub off as much of the mold as possible. Again, make sure to do this outside. Dip a cloth in a mixture of one cup water and one cup denatured alcohol. Rub the affected areas with the cloth. Allow to dry fully.









Alternately, in lieu of denatured alcohol, you can use saddle soap.

, Make sure that the affected object is completely dry. If it is not, put it in a well ventilated area and let it dry. Take the object outside and use a dry cloth to wipe off as much mold/mildew as possible. Dip the cloth in a soap solution (regular dish soap will do fine). Wring it out as much as possible. Use said cloth to wipe off the rest of the spots. Rinse the soap off with water and set the object to dry.









If soapy water is not effective, try using a mixture of bleach or vinegar and water.
If there are multiple pages, be sure to spread them apart so that they do not stick together. It is a good idea to put the book or paper by a fan to speed up the drying process. To further ensure that the pages to not stick together, sprinkle some corn starch between each page while the book/paper is drying. Brush the cornstarch away once it is dry.

, This procedure will help your bathroom dry at a faster rate and help eliminate moisture buildup.


Open the window in your bathroom or turn on the ventilator fan to help remove excess moisture.

, This will allow any trapped moisture on the wet side of the shower curtain to escape and dry faster.


Separate any folds in your shower curtain to release trapped moisture.
Also consider putting an empty laundry basket or an Air-it-Out Shower Hook in the tub to hold the wet shower curtain away from the tub side.

, This will prevent mildew from forming on the area that clings to the tub.


Move the shower curtain to the outside of the bathtub only after it has dried partially to prevent water from dripping onto your bathroom floor.

, This will help prevent soap scum from forming on your shower curtain in addition to mildew.


Use a dry towel or rag to remove water from the wet side of your shower curtain after you shower.

, You can use a commercial bathroom-cleaning product that specializes in preventing mildew growth or make your own cleaning solution.


If you use a commercial cleaning product, use the product as directed by the manufacturer.
To make a natural cleaning solution, mix together 1 part warm water and 1 part distilled white vinegar and pour the mixture into a spray bottle.
You can substitute bleach for vinegar; however, you will be required to properly ventilate your bathroom after using the bleach mixture to prevent adverse health effects from the toxic fumes.

, This procedure will help disinfect your shower curtain and eliminate any bacteria that may contribute to the growth of mildew.

, Oftentimes bathroom and kitchen ceilings will develop mold because there is inadequate ventilation. You can add fans or extractors to the room to allow moist air to escape.


Some extractors can be installed yourself and some will need to be professionally fitted. Speak to a representative at your local hardware supply store to see what kind of extractor will suit your room.

, Mold prefers to grow in dark conditions so keeping windows open to allow sunshine will help prevent the growth of mold colonies on your ceilings. If you cannot add natural light try adding additional lighting, which will also add heat and reduce the growth of mold.

, If your house has poor insulation, this can encourage mold growth, including on the ceiling. The effect of cold air on the outside of walls and warm air on the inside can cause condensation. When warmer, more humid air meets the cold wall, condensation forms, contributing to mold problems.


Insulation provides a barrier between the cold air outside and warm air inside, reducing the conditions causing mold growth.
Insulation should be improved in walls and around heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems.

, A small patch of mold growth on the underside of the ceiling can indicate a large colony on the other side of the ceiling. If you remove the small patch on the underside of the ceiling but there is still a large colony on the other side it will simply grow back.

, Mold prefers damp and warm conditions. Dehumidifiers remove the humidity from the air, reducing the ability of mold to grow and thrive.

, After showering leave the shower doors open and the fan on for at least 15 minutes to allow the water vapor to escape. This removes the humidity that mold prefers for growth.

, Wet towels can add humidity to a room. Make sure you hang your towels to allow them to dry thoroughly, preferably in another room. Do this to keep humidity at a minimum, reducing the conditions for mold growth.


Avoid drying clothes indoor on racks or over chairs if you have a mold growth problem. Excess moisture from drying clothes can encourage more mold growth.

, Usually you will be able to see mold on your ceiling. This mold can be black, green, brown, or orange. Other indicators of mold problems include cracked or peeling paint, discoloration, recurrent black streaks, bulging and/or a musty, damp smell.

, Removing mold quickly and resolving the cause of the mold will prevent any adverse health affects or permanent damage caused to the house. It will also make the removal process easier and the mold less likely to grow back.

, Use a stepladder, footstool or other sturdy item that is meant for standing on. It is best if it has rubber or non-slip feet to prevent slips. If it does not have non-slip feet, purchase a not slip mat to place underneath, especially if the floor is naturally slippery (such as tiles).

, If any kind of porous material (popcorn, wood, drywall, etc.) has been used on your ceiling then you will not be able to clean it properly. The mold will simply come back quickly later. You will have to remove the affected portion of ceiling and replace it.


Porous ceilings include popcorn ceiling, which have to be removed and replaced to fix mold growth., Place the footstool or stepladder underneath the moldy area on the ceiling. Stand on it and reach up to the ceiling. Check that you can comfortably reach the mold and are in a safe location.


Cleaning with a raised arm requires good physical strength and flexibility.
If you have arm, neck, back or wrist problems, cleaning upward for any length of time can be painful. If this is the case, you can either clean in short bursts and take rests, or perhaps find someone stronger to do the cleaning instead.

, If the ceiling is painted and the paint is flaking then you should first use a paint scraper to remove the remaining flakes. This will help to clean up the mold by making sure there is no excess mold under the flaking paint.

, Wear gloves to protect your hands from both the cleaning agent and the mold. Wear old clothes that can easily be cleaned in very hot water to remove any spores that have fallen on you or spread through the air.

, There are multiple options for mold removal solutions. The most common is a combination of 2 tablespoons borax, ¼ cup vinegar and 2 cups hot water which will kill the mold, deodorize the air and reduce the chances of the mold returning.


Borax is a natural cleaning product that does not emit dangerous fumes, is a deodorizer and fungicide and is a natural mold inhibitor. It is also a mineral product with low toxicity and usually quite cost effective.
Vinegar is a mild acid that kills 82% of mold species and is natural and safe. It’s non-toxic, has no dangerous fumes, is a deodorizer and can be bought cheaply from the supermarket. Vinegar can be sprayed directly onto the surface and left to sit.
Bleach is an effective mold killer and will remove any stains caused by the mold but it produces harsh fumes, can damage the materials it is used on and does not penetrate porous materials. The chlorine in the bleach stays on the surface of porous materials while the water is pulled inside, providing more dampness for the mold to feed on. Use bleach in a mixture of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water.
Hydrogen peroxide is a good alternative to bleach because it is safe to use and does not damage the environment. It is an anti-fungal, antiviral, antibacterial, and can remove the stains caused by mold. Spray 3% hydrogen peroxide directly on the mold.
Ammonia can be used on hard surfaces but does not work on porous surfaces. Additionally ammonia is a harsh, toxic chemical that should never be mixed with bleach; it will produce a toxic gas. You can mix ammonia in a one to one ratio with water to use for cleaning.
Baking soda kills mold, is safe, and deodorizes the air. It can even absorb moisture to keep the mold away. Since it kills different species of mold from vinegar, the two are often used together in mold removal solutions. Use 1 tsp baking soda with 1 cup water.
Tea tree oil is a natural and effective mold killing solution. It is expensive but is harmless to people and pets, anti-fungal and antibacterial. Make sure your tea tree oil comes from the Melaleuca alternifolia plant and mix 1 tsp. of the oil with 1 cup of water to create the mold killing solution., These will protect your eyes should any cleaning agent drip down from the ceiling as you clean. Since some of the mold-removing agents can be a bit caustic, protecting your eyes is vital. Additionally, dead spores easily spread through the air so it is essential that you use a mask or respirator while cleaning to prevent inhalation of these unhealthy spores.


Ensure there is adequate ventilation while cleaning the ceiling to prevent inhalation of spores from the air.
You can even block off other areas of the house using plastic sheeting to prevent the spread of spores. Cover doorways and ventilation ducts with plastic sheeting and aim a fan towards an open window to push spores outside.

, Put your cleaning solution into a spray bottle and spray directly on the ceiling mold. Be careful not to spray so much that it drips on you.

, Rub back and forth to shift the mold off. Take breaks as needed, especially if the mold patch is large. You may also need to get down and shift the footstool to reach all parts of the mold growth.

, As you use the cleaning cloth, either switch to new cloths or continually rinse out the one you're using. If you don't do this, there is a risk you'll transfer mold around the ceiling rather than remove it.

, After removing the visible mold spray the ceiling once more to coat it in a layer of mold-killing solution. This will reduce the chances of the mold returning after a few days.

, If there are fans, turn them on. Alternatively, if it's a warm day, open the window and let the breeze in. This will help dry the ceiling and bring spores outside.

, If your ceiling is discolored or you plan on repainting the ceiling then you should sand down the ceiling. Sand the areas where the mold was covering to remove any lingering traces and provide a good base for the new paint.


If you need to repaint the whole ceiling, for example because the paint colors will not match or it will show the area that was re-sanded, you must sand the entire ceiling.

, Paint the ceiling with a waterproof paint. A waterproof paint will prevent mold from growing back, especially if condensation was the cause of the mold. Ask at the hardware store for a brand suitable for your needs and follow its instructions.

, Cracked roof shingles, deteriorating sundeck flashing, or the cracked, loose frame of a door, window drywall separation of the baseboards, where they join in the corner or spread apart is a great home for mildew.

, Higher and the AC will not dehumidify effectively. Set it lower and you create cold surfaces where moisture can collect.

,



Toilets Know that the source of water leakage can be caused by faulty supply lines, fill valve assembles, or toilets that are backed up and overflowed. Make sure that if the bowl or tank begins to overflow, turn off the water at the supply valve.

Washing Machines: A burst water supply line cause half of all water damage incidents.Try leaving a 4-inch gap between the back of the washer and the wall to avoid kicking the hose near the valve connection.

Water Heaters: The average lifespan for a water heater is about 5 years until it begins to leak or burst. Make sure to remove sediment by flushing the tank every six months, especially in areas with hard water.

Shower Stalls: Most of these incidents involve a faulty shower pan. If your home is more than 15 years old you have 37% higher chance of water damage involving a shower. Test the shower pan annually and make sure to inspect the tile and grout every six months, and repair if there are any cracked lines.

, Set it to override the thermostat. When the relative humidity in the house exceeds 60%, it will turn on your AC to draw the moisture out of the air.

, Most of the time when an air conditioner isn't properly dehumidifying the indoor air it is because its cooling capacity is too great. The air cools and shuts off the cooling system before the humidity has dropped.

, Keep the air moving freely in every part of the house. Furnishings and draperies that block air supply grilles cause condensation. All this moisture creates microclimates in your home that welcome and feed mold growth.Throw out things you don’t love or don’t use. Push furniture away from vents and grilles to keep air circulating.

,, Make sure to clean and disinfect along the windows. That’s where a lot of moisture and dust and dirt and debris collect, which is a high source for mold.

, Before you begin to tear out your walls and possibly cross-contaminating your rooms look for mold remediation specialist. Important: Make sure the mold remediator you hire is certified from a reliable source and has insurance.

Ideally, you want to keep the humidity level in your house below 60 percent to prevent mold growth.;
, To prevent too much moisture from building up in the bathroom when you shower or bathe, open a window in the bathroom to vent out moisture.


If you don’t have a window in the bathroom, leave the door open and open the closest window you can.

, Moisture from a shower or bath that sits on the walls of the shower or tub can lead to mold growth. The best way to stop this from happening is to wipe down the walls with a sponge, towel, or squeegee after every time you bathe.


It’s important to get your whole family on board with wiping down the walls after every shower.

, When you're doing laundry, don’t leave wet clothes to sit in the washing machine, as mold will start to grow on the clothes. As soon as the washing cycle is complete, remove the clothes from the machine and transfer them to the drier or the line.


If you need help remembering to transfer clothes, set a timer when you do laundry.
Similarly, never leave damp clothes or towels lying around on the floor or bunched up in a laundry basket. Always hang wet things to dry.

, If you don’t have a drier or prefer to line dry clothes to save energy, always hang the clothes outside. Any water that evaporates from the clothes will otherwise hang in the air in your home, and this can lead to mold growth on walls, floors, and other surfaces.In winter, if you have to hang clothes to dry inside, make sure the room is well-ventilated, that air is circulating, and that air and moisture from inside are pushed outside with fans.

, It only takes between 24 and 48 hours for mold to begin growing on wet surfaces.To prevent this, address standing water as soon as the spill, leak, or flood occurs. This includes water on:


Carpets and floors
Furniture
Clothing
Bedding
Foundation walls and basement floors

, Exhaust vents are important in many rooms in your house, including the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room. In the kitchen and bathroom, turn on exhaust fans anytime you cook or bathe. In the laundry room, make sure the drier is being vented to the outside.


You should also make sure that your crawl space and basement are properly ventilated. If the air isn't circulating enough, install vents or fans., Some appliances are equipped with drip trays that catch water and moisture. This includes refrigerators, air conditioners, and dehumidifiers. Make sure you drain and clean these regularly to prevent mold from growing in them.


Emptying drip trays will also prevent spills, leaks, and overflows, which can lead to moisture problems under the fridge, near window sills, and on basement floors.

, Keeping the air moving in your house and providing a source of fresh air will really help to control the humidity in your home. When the weather allows, open the windows to vent out stale air, and use ceiling fans year-round to circulate the air inside.If you don’t have ceiling fans, you can also use standing or oscillating fans to circulate air.

, A dehumidifier will remove any moisture from the air that you aren't able to prevent, and will help you control the humidity in the house. It’s particularly important to have dehumidifiers in damp areas, such as basements and crawl spaces.


If you have a large home, consider setting up at least two dehumidifiers in different areas of the house.

, Areas that are prone to being wet shouldn’t be fully carpeted. This includes basements that are damp or prone to flooding, and bathrooms. Instead, remove the carpet and install area rugs if necessary.


Area rugs are better than carpet because they can be removed, cleaned, and dried if they get wet., Cold surfaces such as walls, pipes, and tanks are susceptible to having condensation form on them. You can prevent this with extra insulation. Outfit metal pipes with insulating sleeves, wrap toilet and water tanks with insulating blankets, and add more insulation to basement, exterior wall, and attic floors, ceilings, and windows.If condensation has formed on any of these surfaces, dry it immediately and inspect it regularly to keep it dry.

, Leaks are a main cause of moisture problems in a house, which can come from pipes, appliances, the roof, and faucets and taps. Inspect your home regularly for leaks and signs of water damage, and repair issues immediately. Don’t forget to check for leaks:


Under sinks
Around fridges, water coolers, and ice makers
Under floors, especially in the basement
Around air conditioners
Near toilets, tubs, and showers

, Water can also get into your house from outside, and preventing this will protect your house from excess moisture inside. Along with fixing leaks in the roof and elsewhere in the house, you can also get rid of water by making sure that water is drawn away from your house.One way to do this is by installing extra gutters if necessary to direct rainwater away from your home.
If you have trouble with groundwater coming in, consider installing vapor barriers in the basement and a sump pump system that will collect water.

, Gutters are an integral part of the system that keeps water away from your house, so it’s important to keep them clean and well maintained. Clean the gutters every fall and spring to remove dirt, debris, leaves, and other matter.Address leaks in your gutters as soon as you notice them. If you can't repair the leak, replace the section of damaged gutter.

, A crawl space that has a dirt floor is susceptible to mold, because moisture coming up from the ground can make the area wet all the time. To prevent this, dry out the area with fans, and then cover the dirt with a sheet of plastic.Covering the dirt won’t necessarily prevent moisture from coming up, but it will stop mold from growing in the crawl space itself.

, Keeping your house vacuumed and dusted will remove mold spores that enter your home, and this will prevent the mold from taking root and growing. For the best results, vacuum and dust your entire home weekly.Ideally, you should use a vacuum that has a HEPA filter, but this isn't strictly necessary.

, Along with vacuuming, running filters or air purifiers in your house will also help to eliminate mold spores in the air. Filters can be particularly useful in damp areas like bathrooms, basements, and attics, as well as near entryways like doors and windows.


HEPA filters are among the most effective filters, and are able to remove over 99 percent of pollutants from the air., Mold grows best in dark areas, so allowing natural light into your house can prevent it from growing. During the day, open all your curtains to allow natural light in. The heat from the sun will also help to dry up any moisture in the house.


In summer, outfit your windows with lighter drapes and curtains that allow light to pass through. This isn't always practical in winter, because lightweight drapes allow too much cold air in.

, Just as mold prefers dark spaces, so too does it grow better in warm areas. In the summer, use your air conditioner to keep your house cool, dry, and comfortable.


Most molds cannot grow if the temperature is below 70 F (21 C).Keeping your house at this temperature would be very expensive and inefficient, but you can still use the air conditioner to keep the air dry and relatively cool.
In winter, keep the heat as low as possible while still being comfortable.

,


Moisture encourages the growth of mold. Since your washing machine uses water, make sure that your machine is as dry as it can be. Leave the lid of washing machine open when it's not in use. Soiled laundry and surfaces can also provide a breeding ground for mold to form and accumulate.

,


Laundry that has food or grease stains on it are potential sources for mold growth, so don't let your dirty laundry pile up.
Avoid letting damp laundry sit in your laundry room, whether in a machine or outside of one.

, Dehumidifiers can help keep the moisture in your laundry room under control.


Try to keep humidity levels under 45 percent.

,


Without adequate ventilation, moisture can accumulate. Open windows and doors when running your laundry machines. Also consider installing extra ventilation sources.
Verify that ventilation is directed to the outside of your home. If it's not, you may be trapping more moisture and humidity in your laundry room.

,,


Desiccants like silica gel can help absorb the moisture that naturally presents in laundry rooms. Strategically place them in areas where moisture is produced and is bound to accumulate.

, If you store clothes in bags made out of plastic, you might see an increase in the incidence of mold.

,


Basements have many opportunities to encourage mold growth. Condensation from air conditioners, pipes that leak, and the standing water linked to sump pumps can all increase the likelihood of mold growth. Combined with the heat associated with washing machines and dryers, these conditions provide a great breeding ground for mold.

,


Mold breeds rapidly so it's best to address the presence of mold as soon as you see it. Common household items like bleach and water can do wonders to control mold growth in your laundry room.

Use alcohol to disinfect surfaces.,
Apply phenols.,
Try hypochlorite.,
Use aldehydes.",How to Kill Aspergillus Niger1," A 70% alcohol solution is an effective way to kill Aspergillus.


Alcohol is an effective fungicide because it is able to penetrate the cell walls and spores of Aspergillus niger, killing it in the process.
To use alcohol, apply a liberal amount of a 70% solution to all visible areas of fungus, and let it sit for ten minutes.
After 10 minutes of contact time with alcohol, you can wipe the treated area clean and dry it with a clean rag, cloth, or mop.
Alcohol is safe for use in the home and in most settings, bearing in mind its highly flammable property.
Make sure to avoid using it near any flame or fire source.;
, Use phenols, a class of chemical disinfectant that is usually found in mouthwashes, scrub soaps, and surface disinfectants, to kill Aspergillus spores.


Phenols become good fungicidal agents at a concentration of 0.4% to 0.5%, because this concentration allows phenols to seep into the core of the fungus’s cell wall and spores, eventually killing it.
Phenols can be applied liberally to any surface where you suspect that Aspergillus niger colonies are thriving.
Let the phenols sit for about 20 minutes of contact time, then wipe the treated area clean, and dry it with a clean rag, cloth, mop or other preferred method.
However, use phenols with caution if you have infants, because it is toxic to them.
For adults, phenols are generally safe, but long term exposure can cause skin irritations.

, Hypochlorite is a chemical disinfectant with a chlorine base and a 1% chlorine solution that is known to rapidly inactivate fungus such as Aspergillus niger.


A concentrations of 4-6% of hypochlorite, found in household bleach, not only inhibits the growth of molds, but also kills fungal colonies of Aspergillus niger.
A 4-6% hypochlorite solution can be diluted with water in a 1:50 ratio for general surface disinfection and left to dry on the surface.
For surfaces that are visibly infected with Aspergillus niger, an undiluted 4-6% solution is ideal to kill the mold.
If it is applied in an adequate amount, a contact time of 5-10 minutes can immediately kill Aspergillus niger.
After application, the disinfected area can be left to dry or can be wiped clean with a clean rag, cloth, or mop.
Note that hypochlorite can cause skin irritations and produces toxic fumes when combined with ammonium compounds or an acid.

, Aldehyde is a group of chemical disinfectant that is commercially available as a 2% solution of glutaraldehyde.


This substance is used for high strength disinfection and has great fungicidal effects, as it can destroy the fungus and its spores in a very short period of time.
Aldehydes can kill Aspergillus niger with a contact time of around 5 minutes.
Wipe down and dry the area treated with aldehyde with a clean rag, cloth, mop or any method you prefer.
Unfortunately, long term exposure and contact with this compound is discouraged, because glutaraldehyde is highly carcinogenic.

Get a prescription for voriconazole.,
Try taking amphotericin B.,
Talk to your doctor about itraconazole.,
Treat an ear canal infection caused by A.niger.,
Use antifungal creams to treat a nail infected with A.niger.,
Use antifungal eyedrops to treat a cornea infected with A.niger.",How to Kill Aspergillus Niger2," Voriconazole fights fungal infections that occur anywhere in the body. It is an effective medication against A.niger, though it can also kill many other species of fungi. It kills fungi by eradicating their fungal cell walls.


The usual voriconazole prescription is generally one 200 milligram (mg) each day, for 7 to 14 days. The length of treatment depends on the severity of the infection., This is another class of antifungal medication that is effective for treatment against Aspergillus niger. It causes the fungal cell wall of Aspergillus niger to burst, thereby killing it. It also deprives Aspergillus niger of electrolytes and nutrients, which can also lead to fungal death.Amphotericin B is usually available in cream and in ointment form. The cream or ointment is applied topically to any wound or cut infected with A.niger.

, This is another antifungal agent that is similar to voriconazole. However, its method of killing the fungus is different; itraconazole inhibits enzymes in the fungus that help it to grow, metabolize, and reproduce, which results in the death of the fungus.


It is available in capsule form. The usual prescription is generally 200 to 400 mg, twice a day for seven days., This sort of ear infection is called otomycosis. Mold grows in the external canal and in the epithelium of the ear. The mold is black in color and easy to spot. Your doctor will treat this infection by first scraping away the mold, and then applying a topical antibiotic.Clotrimazole is generally the go-to topical cream for this infection. It is a 1% otic cream that can be applied to your ear four times a day.

, Onychomycosis, or nail infection, can be also caused by A. niger. Although it is very rare, A. niger can cause a chronic infection that responds poorly to regular treatment. However, this condition can also be caused by other fungi, so it is important to have a fungal culture done to determine which fungus is causing this infection.Topical antifungal treatments include Ciclopirox Olamine, an 8% solution, and difenoconazole, 10% solution.

, Keratitis is a condition in which the cornea of the eye becomes infected by A. niger. This infection can occur after eye surgery and other surgical procedures, though it is a very rare condition.


Treating keratitis caused by this fungus involves topical treatment. Amphotericin B or Natamycin eye drops are generally prescribed for this specific infection. These eye drops are usually administered hourly."

Use garlic cloves.,
Apply golden seal.,
Try olive oil or extract.,
Use coconut oil.",How to Kill Aspergillus Niger3," Raw garlic is an antifungal, and can be used to kill Aspergillus niger.


Raw garlic contains allicin, a natural compound that has strong antifungal properties and can kill a wide variety of fungus, including Aspergillus niger.
Eat 2-3 raw garlic cloves every meal to sufficiently treat Aspergillus niger.
You can also take garlic as a non-odorous capsule three times a day.
It's fungicidal effects become apparent when the allicin is absorbed by your stomach and intestines, and then into your bloodstream.

, The root of golden seal is commonly used as a wound disinfectant for minor cuts, but can also be used as an effective antifungal.


Golden seal can treat Aspergillus niger when taken orally, or applied topically on infected skin.
Golden seal also enhances the antifungal effects of other antifungal agents, making it sought after as an antifungal herbal remedy.
Golden seal is taken as a capsule, usually one capsule twice a day.
It can also be used as a tincture for infected cuts and wounds in your skin.

, Olive oil contains a strong antifungal compound, derived from olives, called oleuropein.


Oleuropein is a strong agent against fungus like Aspergillus niger.
Olives are special as an antifungal agent because instead of killing Aspergillus niger immediately, the oleuropein first disrupts the reproductive ability of the fungus.
This quickly halts the spread of Aspergillus niger.
Then, it cuts off the food supply of the fungus, eradicating Aspergillus niger.
Olive oil can be taken orally, by mixing it with your food, or as a topical treatment on skin wounds.
A safe and effective intake of olive oil is 25 to 40 mL in a day., Coconut oil contains lauric, capric, and caprylic acids, which have potent antifungal characteristics.


Regular intake of coconut oil also acts as a mild natural laxative that can kill and flush out Aspergillus niger in your digestive system.
A recommended antifungal dose of coconut oil is 3 - 6 tablespoons a day or 45 – 90 mL of coconut oil integrated in your food as part of your diet."

Make sure there is adequate ventilation.,
Exhaust all high concentration of moisture at the source.,
Vacuum and wipe down the room regularly to keep the level of dust particles in check.,
Clean the air conditioner regularly to prevent biofilm from forming in the fins.,
Avoid leaving the air conditioner turned on all the time.",How to Live Healthy and Mold Free in Small Tight Homes," In a small living space in harsh weather conditions, this may not be as easy as it sounds. Often, to keep the weather conditions from the room, proper mechanical sealing and insulation of the doors and windows are done to keep the room from the extreme heat or cold outside. This often in itself becomes the source of the problem. If a small room too tightly sealed, ventilation is stifled. Remove or reduce weather seals to allow for the right amount of air inlet into the space. As weather permits, regularly open windows and doors to allow full circulation to channel fresh outside air right through the room.;
, This means a ducted cooker hood and exhaust fan for the shower. These exhaust systems need to be checked for CFM airflow rate to make sure that they are working properly. If the room is too well sealed, these ventilators will not work properly. See tips below on how to do that.

, Most of these dust particles are skin flakes and linen fiber. Frequently wash bed sheets and linens to minimize fibers and skin flakes build up. In clean room operations in wafer labs for IC making, skin flakes have been identified as the number one culprit to particle contamination. It is by far the largest source of particle generation.

, Biofilm is formed from the dead skin flakes from the human body. Because there is a layer of oil on our skin, these skin flakes will stick onto any surface they come into contact with, especially the path of the airflow in a ductless air conditioner, i.e. the cooling fins and the rotor blades. Bacteria colonies will form on these skin layers producing a bio-slime which in turns binds more tightly on the surfaces they adhere to. As the biofilm get thicker and covers more surface of the cooling coil and fins, they lose their hydrophilic properties preventing the condensate from draining off. This in turn reduces the air conditioner's ability to dehumidify the room especially from moisture sources like hot showers. At the same time, the skin flakes also become a food source for mold as well. Once mold take root in the air conditioner, it can spread spore all over the room; on the ceiling, under the mattress, on the walls. Practically, you could see mold growing where the air is the most stagnant. By cleaning the air conditioner, just plain vacuuming or brushing is not sufficient. Some type of chemical solution cleaning system is absolutely necessary to keep the ac unit clean and fully operational. See wikihow related article for instructions on ""How To Clean Split Air Conditioners"" safely and effectively especially in a small tight space where you may not have much room to things about for the cleaning process.

Watch materials high in cellulose.",How to Identify Black Mold2," Mold typically grows in well-saturated areas. Basements, bathrooms, kitchens, and garages are commonly invaded by black mold. If you suspect mold in your building, start looking in the rooms that hold the most water., Even if an area is not normally water prone, a leak can lead to mold. Leaky water pipes are often culprits, but you can have other sources of water, too. If your air conditioner is not properly drained and insulated, it can leak water. This can result in black mold around the leak., Porous materials such as grout are often used to join two slabs or panels. For example, kitchen and bathroom tiles often have grout between them. If water frequently gets into the pores in the grout, black mold can grow there., Sealants can also be prone to growing black mold. Sealants are often used in high moisture areas (e.g. around your shower). Because of this, black mold can set up and grown on a sealant, such as calk., Black mold naturally grows on materials containing cellulose. These are plant based materials such as paper, cardboard, and wood. Keep a close eye on any paneling or file cabinets that get wet. Know that any wood, drywall, carpet, or cloth can easily grow black mold under the right conditions (moist)."

Cover plants and landscaping near the patio with tarps to protect them from cleaning solutions and water run-off.;
, Clean out the crack(s) with a wire brush. Vacuum or blow out any dust and dirt, or use a broom to make sure the crack is clean. Fill the crack with masonry crack filler. Depending on the brand, either apply the filler with a scraper, or a caulking gun (if necessary). To fill deeper or wider cracks, fill them by a quarter-inch (six mm) at a time. Allow the product to dry between applications according to label instructions.For best results, repair cracks in completely dry concrete. If the concrete is slightly damp, dry with a blow dryer or heat gun, then wait fifteen minutes. If more water has seeped into the crack, protect the concrete from water until it dries on its own.Sand down grout- or concrete-based fillers with fine sandpaper, then clean the area a second time. (Do not sand self-leveling or latex-based sealants).

, Pull out anything that has grown on the surface of the concrete, and spray the patio down with a pressure washer if you have one.If you don’t have a pressure washer, remove what you can by hand, sweep the patio, and hose it down to remove any excess clumps, dirt, or debris.


Borrow a power washer from a neighbor or rent one from a tool rental company or home and building store if you don’t have one of your own. A pressure washer will be very useful for cleaning and rinsing your concrete patio prior to painting.
To clear a large amount of vegetation, spray a broad-spectrum herbicide such as glyphosate (Roundup) at least two weeks before cleaning.

, Concrete can absorb and trap dirt and grease. To ensure it is completely clean and has a fresh surface for paint to adhere to, scrub the concrete with a product that will draw substances out, such as trisodium phosphate,muriatic acid,or phosphoric acid.These products will also help remove old paint, which needs to come off before repainting.These products are not designed to remove old paint.


Read all safety information before you begin. Many concrete cleaning products require everyone in the area to wear rubber gloves, eyewear, masks, rubber boots, and protective clothing.
Rinse the concrete so the surface is wet.
Apply your cleaning solution (acid, trisodium phosphate, or other cleaner) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Scrub the concrete with a stiff brush.
If you use muriatic or phosphoric acid, this process is called etching, and will ensure the concrete has a sandpaper-like texture that paint will stick to better. Etching should be done before painting new or bare concrete.

, It is best to use a power washer, as this will wash away excess debris, old paint, and efflorescence, a whitish salt deposit that forms on surfaces like concrete and stucco.If there is still any old paint left on the concrete, scrub it with a wire brush and continue power washing until it’s gone.


If you used an acid solution to etch the concrete, neutralize the pH on the surface by sprinkling baking soda over top before rinsing.Especially after etching, be sure to rinse the concrete with water until no chalky powder comes off the surface when you touch it with your fingers., Before painting your patio, make sure that paint will adhere in the first place. All concrete is porous and absorbs moisture, but if your concrete patio contains too much moisture, you won’t be able to paint it until you correct the moisture content.Take an 18-inch by 18-inch square of aluminum foil or thick plastic and tape down all four sides, sealing the square to the concrete with tape.
Wait 16 to 24 hours. After that time, carefully remove the square of foil or plastic and check the concrete and the underside of the square for condensation or moisture.
If the concrete is still damp, wait until weather allows complete drying. Protect the area from sprinklers and garden runoff.
Proceed once the concrete is completely dry.

, Since you are painting concrete in an outdoor area, not just any paint will suffice. Regular exterior paint will likely crack on a concrete surface and peel off shortly after being applied.There are several types of paint that will work for your outdoor concrete patio, and they include:


Concrete paints that contain sealants or waterproofing features, so the paint is designed to resist water, salt, oil, and grease.This is a good choice for paint because it's specifically designed for outdoor concrete and resistance to various substances and elements.
Latex, water-based, or oil-based exterior paints that are designed for floor, patios, or porches.These paints are also a good choice, as they are designed for exterior use and are specific to withstand foot traffic.
Masonry paints that contain added binders and epoxies. While it may bond well with the concrete, it won't necessarily protect your concrete from the elements.
Garage floor coatings with colorful additives to protect and decorate at the same time.

, To help you decide what color to paint your patio, consider what color the exterior of your house is, and what color your patio furniture is. Take color swatches with you to the paint store so you can compare your existing decor with your paint choices. Don't be afraid to ask the paint specialist for help and advice!

, A concrete or block primer will give you a nice, even surface to work with, instead of the uneven, porous surface of non-primed concrete. It will also reduce the number of coats required to properly cover your surface.


Choose an exterior-grade primer if you’re going to use one, and make sure it’s designed for concrete. Concrete primers are often called concrete, masonry, or bonding primers.

, Once you’ve decided what kind of paint you’re going to use, you will need to do some basic calculations to determine how many cans of paint you’ll need to cover the patio surface. Check the paint can or manufacturer's website regarding how much coverage one can provides, and compare that with the square footage of your patio.


Square footage is determined by multiplying the length by the width of the area you are dealing with. Don't worry if your patio isn't perfectly square or rectangular: you just need a basic idea of the area you're going to cover.
Don't forget to take into account whether you plan on applying multiple coats. A primer will reduce the likelihood of having to apply more than one or two coats of paint.

, Before getting started, get together all the tools you’re going to need for painting. The best painting tools for this will be a masonry brush, a high-capacity roller, or a texture roller.The equipment you’ll need may include:


Primer (optional) and paint
A paint roller frame and cover
A paint tray
Roller and brush extenders
Masking or painter’s tape
Thick and thin brushes
Plastic or painter's tarps

, Use tape to line the surfaces touching your concrete patio, such as deck edges, exterior walls, doors or windows, and other areas that you don’t want to accidentally paint. Cover the ground nearby with tarps if necessary.

, Ideally, begin painting on a dry day when there has been no rain in the previous 24 hours, and none is expected in the long-range forecast. The best temperature for outdoor painting is about 50 F (10 C)., Make sure your patio is completely dry before beginning to paint or prime. Pour your primer into a paint tray. Take one of your thinner brushes and dip it into the primer a few times. Wipe off the excess on the inside of the paint tray, and make sure the brush has an even coat of paint on it.


Start by applying primer with the brush around any edges or places where the patio touches other buildings or parts of the house.
Use a roller or thicker brush and extender to apply primer to the rest of the patio. Apply in two different directions for even coverage.

, While it should be dry in about two hours, wait at least eight hours before you begin painting. However, don’t let more than 30 days elapse.If you are reusing your brushes, rollers, and trays, make sure you clean them well and let them dry before reusing them.

, The tray will make it easier to coat your brushes or rollers evenly with paint, and this will make it easier for you to apply even coats of paint to your patio.

, Use a smaller paint brush to apply a coat of paint around any edges, joints, or other areas that are too awkward for the roller or larger brush. Be sure to use the smaller brush to apply paint to any part of the patio adjoining areas where you placed tape, to ensure you don’t get paint on other walls, decks, or windows.

, Choose a starting point, such as an interior corner against the house, and work your way out from there. Don’t paint yourself into a corner or center where you won’t be able to get out again without walking over fresh paint. Use even brush or roller strokes to apply a thin, even layer of paint.


Attach your roller or brush to your extender so you can remain standing while painting. This will help prevent injury to your back, knees, and wrists.
If you're using a brush instead of a roller, ensure it's big enough to cover a large area so that your paint doesn't dry before you finish a section.

, Concrete and exterior paints can take six or more hours to dry before they’re ready for additional coats, so be sure to check the manufacturer’s recommendations., Follow the same steps as before. Use a smaller brush around delicate or awkward edges and a larger brush or roller to complete the coat. Apply a sufficient number of coats to achieve the desired depth of color you want for your patio. Two or three coats are usually required.


Apply each new coat in a different direction than the last, to ensure even coverage.

, While you will likely be able to walk on your patio after 24 hours, you should wait about seven days before replacing furniture."

, This will remove any loose mud and make cleaning much easier.

, This will remove dirt that has embedded itself onto your driveway pavers. It can get into the cracks and loosen dirt that was resistant to your hose. This is also a good way to remove moss.

, Any liquid, hand washing, detergent will work. Start with a small amount of detergent and add more as needed., You can also scrub with a natural bristle brush but be careful not to scrape your pavers.

, They can apply an industrial strength cleaner or replace the paver in question. "

Finish the whole job at once.,
Clean the sprayer or roller.",How to Seal Pavers," Water-based sealers are sprayed on and give an even coverage. The main benefit of a water-based sealer is that it hardens the joint sand and penetrates into pavers better. This ends up creating a hard seal over the entire paved area.Water-based sealers do not darken the stones or give a high amount of shine to the pavers. Choose this sealer for bricks that are porous and won’t shine much anyway.
If you are unsure what type of pavers you have or you aren’t sure which sealer is best, consult a home improvement store employee.
Water-based sealers often require that you apply more than one coat to the paved area.;
, Solvent sealers can give a much higher gloss to the stones than water-based sealers. The downside is that they do not harden sand as effectively. This sealer is great for smooth, non-porous stones.


If your pavers are laid tightly together without joint sand, this is a good option.
Solvent sealers are often thicker than water-based sealers, so you may be required to use a roller rather than a sprayer.

, Sealers may be sprayed on with a pump sprayer, laid with a nap roller, or a combination of both. Follow the instructions on the sealer you buy to use the proper tools.Thin sealers can often be sprayed on, which is much faster. Thicker sealers may need to be rolled, which can be slower and won’t always cover as evenly.
Some sealers are sprayed on but require that you backroll the pavers to even out the coating.

, For best application, you want a nice wide fan spray, so be sure that the sprayer you use has either multiple head attachments or an adjustable spray pattern. Never use a sprayer that shoots a narrow stream., Many sealers will require that you lay them with a roller rather than a sprayer, and in this case it is important that the roller is thick enough. The sealer will most likely give you instructions about this. For example, one sealer might suggest a roller with a 1” thick nap.This is important because if the roller is not thick enough, the sealer will not get down into the cracks between the pavers and thus won’t seal as well as it should.
A roller that is too thick might coat the sealer on too thickly as well, and you won’t get an even coat across the pavers.

, Sealing without cleaning first is only going to seal dirt and grime into the pavers. You can power wash the pavers, as long as there isn’t sand in between that would be washed away. You could use some dish soap and hot water for areas that have oil or tire marks from cars. A stiff broom will help scrub the pavers clean.The type of pavers and the way they are laid will determine the best washing method. If the pavers are packed tightly together, power washing is a great option, but not if the pavers are laid with sand between them. It’s rarely a good idea to sand-blast pavers.
If the pavers make up a driveway that has a lot of car traffic, wash the pavers more thoroughly to get as much of the grime off as you can.
Smooth pavers that don’t retain much grime might be sufficiently cleaned with a quick broom sweeping.

, Sometimes pavers settle unevenly, which creates a tripping hazard in areas that people frequently walk. Lift any uneven pavers and level the spot where they’re sitting by adding sand under the paver.If your pavers are laid tightly together, lifting any of them up to even them out may not be an option. Still, sealing is more effective when the pavers are all level.

, To make sure you cover the whole paver area, work in a specific pattern. A good option can be going around the entire outer edge of the area first to establish a border, then dividing the rest of the area into 3-5 sections depending on how big it is.


For example, a 100 square foot patio could be done in four 5ftx5ft sections.

, The sealer will make stones appear darker when they get wet, but it can still be helpful to use a consistent motion. You can move the spraying nozzle in circles for the best coverage.You don’t want to cover some areas with more sealer than others, so it is important to pay attention to what stones you cover as you spray.
If you are working in a small area, you may not have a hard time keeping track of what you have sealed, but if you are doing an entire driveway it becomes more important.

, Sealing pavers is not the kind of thing you want to break up into multiple rounds of work. If you don’t do the whole thing at one time, it’s likely that you will lose track of where you have already sealed.


The amount of time it takes you to seal the entire area will depend on how big it is. A small patio may only take 20 minutes, but an entire driveway will likely take you a couple of hours.

, Rinse the sprayer or roller thoroughly immediately after you finish the project. If you let the sealer sit for too long it will harden on your equipment. If you don’t want to wash the roller, you can throw it away.


Make sure to spray water through the nozzle to clean the hose as well.
When you read the sealer instructions, see if there are any special instructions about cleaning equipment. You may need lacquer thinner or something stronger than water to clean the sealer out of your sprayer.

If you are digging in high moisture soil, you will need to dig further into the ground. The same goes for if your foundation will be near/on a hillside.There is a simple way to test moisture levels in your soil. Scoop an empty coffee can into the soil, leaving three inches of space at the top of the can. Fill up the rest of the can with water. Wait until the water soaks into the soil, and repeat. Time how fast it takes the water to soak in. Anything slower than 1 inch per hour means you have very low moisture levels.Instead of using home methods of measuring, sometimes it is best to call in a professional. They will be able to provide all of the diagnostics tests which will tell you everything you need to know about the soil you plan to use. They will even be able to measure the flatness of your soil, and whether or not you need to adjust your foundation's height.;
, This is critical to do before you get started. You need to contact the proper government officials to give you the proper permits and licenses that will allow you to lay your foundation, and construct your building. You will also need to get the property surveyed by a contractor, who can give you more valuable information about the land you are building on., You should clear grass, roots, and any surrounding debris. This is also a great time to use the survey of your property to determine the height of your foundation. If the planned spot for your foundation is not level, use a backhoe, or shovel to level the area off., Before you dig any holes, it is important to call 811. This is the Digline and you can use it to request that utility companies come out to the site and mark areas where any pipes or wires might be. This will help to ensure that you do not damage any of the pipes or wires running underground and increase the safety of your project. Call at least a few days before you plan to start digging., You can use a shovel, but it will take longer, and will not be as precise. The hole for your footings has to be bigger than the foundation, at least 2 feet on all sides. The extra room allows for you and whomever you are working with to get in the holes and lay down the footings.The dimensions of the perimeter hole should be at least 2 feet wide by 2 feet deep, preferably 3 feet deep.Remember that you are not digging the entire area for your planned building. You are just digging the perimeter of the building. The area where your building will be is formed in later steps.
After you are done carving out the area to lay the foundation, use a shovel to clear out any excess dirt and debris that might still be laying there., This is critical because your concrete needs support beams, otherwise it will crumble. Buy rebar which fits your planned footings. You can then lift up the rebar by attaching grade pins to them. These can be purchased at most hardware stores.


Set your rebar in first. Then add the grade pins on top of the rebar. Set each grade pin about 2 feet apart from one another, and a foot away from the corners.Then lift up the rebar and attach it to the grade pins. There should be a manual hook on the grade pins to attach the rebar. Do not use a tie or string, which can cause damage to the footing.
Make sure that the rebar is equidistant from the base of your opening, as it is from the sides.

, This layer of concrete should at least come up 1 foot, if not more. You do not want to make huge walls on top of a small initial layer. The standard is generally 16-20 inches of concrete.Make sure to use the correct mixture of concrete. If there is not enough water, or too much mix, the concrete will not dry correctlyHow to Make Concrete


, Make sure there are no cracks or crevices left on the surface layer of the concrete. This is important because the concrete walls you will add later need a smooth, even surface to rest on. After the concrete dries, you can use a level to make sure that the area is completely even., These will be used to set the walls of your foundation. Each of these boards will need to be about 2 feet by 10 feet (an inch or two thick). The shorter sides of the boards will sit down, on top of the initial concrete layer. You will need enough boards for both the inside and outside of your trench footing, so that there is no space in between the boards.


You can add in a little dirt on the outer part of the outside boards to help them stand firm and upright.Use metal bars outside of the wooden frames in order to hold the boards tightly together.You can also cut boards or plywood strips 6 to 8 inches wide and 2 to 3 feet long and use duplex nails to span across the joints of your foundation boards to hold them together. Be sure all of your staking is sturdy or you risk “blowing out” the boards and losing all of the concrete. Use plenty of stakes to prevent this from happening.

, Once more, make sure that you have the correct mixture of concrete. How to Make Concrete In general, you should form the entire job and pour all the concrete at once with a concrete truck. How much wall is exposed over top of the ground depends on the level at which your building will rest.

, Drill 3-4 holes about 6 inches apart. Do this to each side. Insert a pin into each of these holes.This is important because if you do not insert the pins, your walls can shift, causing the building to collapse.
Pour the second and third walls coming off of the initial wall. The concrete will form over the pin and join the walls together.
Reinsert pins into the sides of the second and third walls.

, You can use a hand float and go over the tops, making sure there are no cracks and crevices. You should also use an edger to go around the edges and smooth them over., Let your concrete dry, and then remove the frames. You will want to do this soon after the concrete dries, otherwise the wooden frames can get stuck. Try to pull them up from the top, so as to not damage the newly poured foundation walls., These sprays can be found at most hardware stores at very low prices. It is basically a can of spray cement. Adding this extra layer of protection will prevent water and other liquids from damaging your foundation. Make sure to spray on both sides of the wall., This is the space between the newly poured foundation walls. Use a rake to disperse the gravel evenly across the space. This should be a layer no more than 1 inch thick.


If you are using gravel to fill up the foundation and pour a slab on top, then the gravel should be 6 to 8 inches deep. You will also need to use a plate compactor in different directions until the gravel is well compacted. Next, add another 6 to 8 inches of gravel (called lifts) and repeat the compaction until the gravel is 4 to 6 inches from the top of the wall for the slab depth.

, This will act as a vapor barrier between the soil and the foundation. This prevents evaporated moisture from rising up into your foundation and causing cracks. It is best to purchase a custom made polyethylene sheet that is the exact size of your foundation space., The specifications of thickness, width and other factors is dictated in local building code regulations. The wire mesh will hold your concrete together, and prevent cracking.You can also add in bar chairs which will prop up the wire mesh. These bars are inserted directly into the plastic sheeting. You will need one every two to three inches.

, The drainage pipes are set on the outside edges of your foundation. If you do not put these in, water can build up underneath your structure and damage your foundation. Make sure you check whether your building will be using radiant-in-floor heating. This will need to be installed at this level as well, right above the polyethylene sheet., Make sure that the consistency of your concrete is correct. How to Make Concrete You can use a bull float to smooth over the upper surface of the foundation. Then use an edger to smooth out the edges. If there are smaller inconsistencies in the concrete, wait for the concrete to dry slightly. Then sit on top of a piece of foam (on top of concrete), and use a hand float to work out the smaller details., These bolts can be bought at your nearest hardware store. Anchor bolts are important because they will secure the building to the foundation slab. About half of the anchor bolt should stick out of the concrete. Place these one foot apart from one another, and one foot from the corners., There is no need to wait for your foundation to settle into the ground because you should build on undisturbed soil."

, Take a large square rod and run it over the excavated area to ensure that it is flat and level. If you feel it rising and falling you will need to readjust the soil surface to make it even., You can rent a compactor machine from your local hardware store. Run it over the ground to make sure that it is solid, flat, level and compacted., Your gravel base goes on top of the excavated area and needs to be 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) deep. Run your rod over it again to make sure the base is level then compact it., You can now arrange your pavers in the desired pattern and be as creative as you like., Use the compactor machine again and this time run it over the pavers to make sure they are compressed down into your base and that there is no breakage., The sand filler will help to hold the pavers in place and keep them from moving. Simply pour it on top of your pavers and sweep it in. Now your pavers should be level and won't move."

The mold needs to be at least 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) thick.;
, This will make it easier to remove the stepping stone from the mold.If you are using a cardboard mold, cover the inside of the mold with a plastic sheet (ie: plastic wrap or a plastic bag) first. It would be a good idea to grease the plastic sheet afterwards as well., This is very important. Concrete is dusty and can irritate sensitive skin. It's not something you want getting into your lungs either. Put on a pair of safety goggles, a dust mask, and work gloves., Each brand will be a little different, so follow the instructions on your container closely. If the concrete is very wet, add some more dry concrete powder to it. The concrete should feel like wet sand. You want it to clump together when you squeeze it., Use a trowel to spread it around so that it covers the bottom layer of the mold. If you are using a square mold, make sure that it reaches and fills the corners. You want it to be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick., Cut a scrap of chicken wire until it is 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) smaller than your mold. Set it into your mold and gently press it into the wet concrete. This step is not absolutely necessary, but it will help prevent the stepping stone from cracking later on.If you can't find chicken wire, you can use sturdy, wire mesh instead.

, Use a trowel to spread the concrete around and make it smooth. You want this layer to be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick as well., Mosaic tiles are a popular choice, but you can use other items as well, such as: broken pottery, glass gems, sea glass, sea shells, and pretty stones.If you are using glass gems or sea glass, paint the back of each piece with white spray paint. This will help keep them looking bright and prevent the concrete from dulling them down.Let the paint dry before moving on., You can use a random pattern, or arrange the decorations to make words or images such as a name or the moon and stars. If your decorations are sinking into the concrete, wait about 30 minutes before trying again. This will give the concrete time to set up again.

Press the mosaics far enough into the concrete so that they don't stick out. This way, you'll be less likely to tip over them.

, After two days, flip the mold over onto a soft surface, such as a patch of grass, a towel, or a blanket. Gently tap the bottom, then lift the mold away., Sand away any rough areas with sandpaper, and fill in any holes with cement. Wipe the top of the stepping stone clean with a wet sponge or an old toothbrush. This will remove any cement that got stuck to glass or porcelain tiles or gems.Let the stepping stone dry before moving on., You can leave your stepping stone as it, or you can varnish the top, decorated part to give it that wet look. A high-quality marine varnish will work especially well here.You can also use a clear, outdoor-quality varnish instead.Let the varnish cure completely before using the stone.

Curing times are different from drying times. Read the label on your varnish carefully.
You only need to varnish the top, decorated part.
Pay attention to the finish. A matte finish is not recommended for glass gems or tiles because it will dull them down.

, Choose a spot in your garden for the stepping stone. Use a shovel or trowel to dig a shallow, 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) deep hole in the soil. Set the stone into it, design side up, then gently pat the soil around it."

Great leaves include: gunnera, hosta, and rhubarb. Make sure that the leaf does not have any holes or tears.Some cucumber, squash, and pumpkin leaves may also be big enough. Some calla lily leaves may also be large enough.

, You can also brush some cooking oil onto it. This will help keep the concrete from sticking and make it easier to remove., This is important, as concrete dust can irritate your lungs, eyes, and skin. You will need safety goggles, rubber gloves, and a dust mask. At this point, it would also be a good idea to put on a set of old clothes and protect your work surface with a plastic sheet., Each brand will be a little different, so prepare the concrete according to the instructions on the bag. You want the concrete to be more dry and firm than wet and soupy. It should clump together like wet sand when you squeeze a handful of it.

Use a lightweight concrete with little gravel for a smoother, decorative stepping stone.Use a heavier concrete with more gravel for a strong, sturdy stepping stone that will get lots of foot traffic., Place the leaf down onto a large, plastic sheet. Use a trowel to scoop the concrete onto the leaf. Make the layer about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) thick., While still wearing your gloves, gently pat the concrete down onto the leaf. If you need to, guide it towards the edge of the leaf, and wipe any excess concrete away. Do not to let the concrete slop over the edges of the leaf., How long this takes depends on the type of concrete you are using. This will typically take about 2 to 3 days., Flip the stepping stone over, then peel the leaf away and discard it. If there are bits stuck to the concrete, you can scrape them away with water and an old toothbrush. You will be left with a leaf-shaped stepping stone. Depending on how lightweight the concrete was, you may also see the leaf's veins embedded into the concrete.

Use a hammer and chisel to chip away any flakes of overhanging concrete on the edges of the stepping stone., You don't have to do this, but it will give your leaf stepping stone a nice, wet look. Use a high-quality outdoor or marine varnish to lightly coat the front of the stepping stone., Choose a spot for the stone, then dig a shallow how that is 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) deep. Set the stepping stone into the hole, then fell any gaps in with more soil."

Clean the stones.,
Apply the paint.,
Allow the paint to dry.,
Place your stones.,
Observe at night.",How to Make Glow in the Dark Stepping Stones1," If you are applying paint, you need a clean surface to start with. Dust and dirt under the paint will cause problems with adhesion and you will end up with flaky paint. Wipe each stone down with soap and water, and then again with just water. Let the stones dry before applying paint., You can apply paint in two common ways. You can buy spray paint and spray the stones, or you can brush the paint on. If you use spray paint, follow the directions on the can regarding time between coats and the distance the nozzle should be from the stone. If you use a brush on paint, make sure that you follow instructions regarding the drying time between coats., Once the paint has been applied, it will need to dry. The final dry (known as curing) will take longer than the dry times between your coats. This is because all of the solvent (the chemicals that keep the paint in liquid form) must evaporate. Avoid smudging the paint or getting it dirty before the curing process is over.Depending on the type of paint used, curing can take anywhere from several minutes to hours. Consult the instructions on the can.

, Find a good location to place your glow in the dark stones. Keep in mind that any night time lights (e.g. a porch light) will make the glow less prominent. For the most impressive glow, put the stones in a dark, open path (e.g. through a garden).

, Once your paint has cured, let the stone sit in the sun all day. The paint should absorb energy from the sun. It will slowly release this energy as light (much less intense than the original sunlight), which you will be able to see in the dark.


Street lights and yard lights may make the stones seem less impressive.

First, if there are distortions in the rip, but all the metal is still there you can straighten it.,
Get some good exterior caulk and a piece of solid board or exterior plywood large enough to fit as a patch underneath the damaged area.,
Have someone support the the area from beneath with a backup timber while you drill small screw holes an inch or so away from the tear along both sides of the tear.

,
Put the well caulked board covering the rip from beneath and begin screwing in suitable screws that have neoprene contact seals on them from outside on the shed roof.,
Caulk the tear from above, outside and smooth it.

,
Use sheet metal, pop-rivets and a pop rivet gun instead of the wood board and the screws.,
Lay a strip or sheet of metal of a suitable size over the damaged area.,
Drill and put a screw in your first hole of the size prescribed for a pop rivet through the patch and roof.,
Apply caulk between the patch and the roof.

,
Pop the rivets into place with the rivet gun and caulk each one.

,
Put a bead of caulk around the patch patch and you might spread it just slightly.

",How to Repair a Tear in the Roof of a Metal Storage Shed," Get someone to hold a heavy timber against the damaged area as you use a hammer to straighten the metal as best you can. Once straightened, be sure any distortions are up toward the sky so that the inside surface is as straight as possible. This alone, at least, would minimize the amount of rain entering while you finish the patching.

, Be sure it completely covers the damaged area.

,, Have a brace underneath or a strong friend to hold the patch while putting screws in.

,,;
, (You will apply caulk between the patch and the roof before putting in the pop-rivets.)

, Go to the other end and do the same. Now, drill a series of holes around the damaged area, making sure the holes are aligned or staggered neatly.

Plan out your path, using chalk spray or another temporary marker.,
Measure the area of your intended path so you'll know how much gravel to purchase.,
Pick your gravel.,
Dig a trench about 2 inches deep.,
Line your trench with landscape fabric or two layers of burlap or newspaper to smother weeds, but allow drainage.

,
Edge your trench with rocks or bricks to contain the gravel.

,
Add your gravel, raking it evenly over your path.

",How to Make a Gravel Path,"


First, plan out the basic route of your path.
Next, use measuring tools to mark out an even width along your route.
Double check to make sure there is no delicate plumbing or wiring along your intended route!;
, You will want your path to be covered by at least an inch and a half (3 cm) of gravel.

, Choose a color and texture that is appropriate to your yard design, needs, and budget.

, The edges of the trench will be flush with the outlined edges of your path.

Open a bag of concrete.,
Mix glow powder into the concrete.,
Add water.,
Pour concrete into molds.,
Allow the concrete to dry.,
Break open the molds.",How to Make Glow in the Dark Stepping Stones2," You can place the whole bag of concrete into a wheelbarrow. Use a spade to break the bottom of the bag open, and lift the bag up. The concrete should spill out into the wheelbarrow. You may have to shake the bag a bit to get it all out., Glow powder is a special chemical that is designed to absorb energy from the sun through the day. You can find powders that are made to be compatible with concrete at your local hardware store. While the ratios vary, most manufacturers recommend that you create a dry mix of 85% concrete and 15% glow powder.For example, if you had a total of 10 gallons (38 L) of mix, 8.5 gallons (32 L) would be concrete and 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) would be glow powder.
Choose a powder with earth illuminate versus one with a zinc base for the best illumination.

, Consult the concrete bag to know how much water is needed. Pour the water in slowly, mixing as you go. When you are finished, your concrete should be a wet sludge-like consistency., Find or make a mold that is the size and shape that you want your stepping stones. Consider marking a level off point on each mold so every stepping stone is the same thickness. You should also have as many molds as you wish to have stepping stones. The concrete in the wheelbarrow will dry up before you get to pour a second round., For the fastest dry times, leave the molds in a dry, relatively warm place. It can still take 24 hours or longer for the concrete to completely dry. If you disturb the concrete before it is dry, you can cause cracks and other imperfections in your stones., If you used a reusable mold, use a knife or other prying tool to loosen the concrete. If your mold was disposable, you can just break the mold away from the concrete. Now, your stones are ready to set wherever you want them."
"
Use stencils for painted stones.,
Set trinkets or small objects into concrete stones.,
Make a cast with concrete stones.",How to Make Glow in the Dark Stepping Stones3," One of the easiest ways to customize paint is by using a stencil. Lay the stencil down on the stone you wish to paint, and then paint over it. Any area uncovered by the stencil will be painted, and any area covered will not.The contrast between the painted and not painted areas will give your stone a clear, visible design.

, If you are making concrete stones, you can place things in the concrete. As the concrete dries, it will harden around these objects. Once the concrete has fully hardened, the objects you added will be held in place.You can place things like small pebbles, trinkets, small yard decorations, or personal items in the concrete.

, While the concrete is still soft, you can use an object to indent the surface of the stone. This will leave an impression in the concrete and create a cast. Most commonly, this is done by placing your hand in the wet mix and creating a stone that has a cast of your handprints."

Choose a variety of grass seeds that will work best in your yard.,
Test your soil for nitrogen, phosphorus, pH levels and other elements with a soil test kit.,
Water your grass around the same time each morning.,
If you put a cup of Ammonia (nitrogen source) into a five gallon pail of water and a cup of epsom salts (magnesium sulfate), mix and throw it on your lawn with a cup it will make the grass greener.,
Mow your lawn 1 day after watering.,
If you mow your lawn high it will be more durable against drought and against frost.

,
In the summer it is good to mulch the lawn (don't vacuum up the grass) so that you can spend less on water.

,
Aerate your lawn at least once in the spring and again in the fall for a green lawn.,
The best way to prevent weeds is to plant more grass with seeds.",How to Get Green Grass,"


Each type of grass has its own set of instructions based on climate and environment. Some variations of grass prefer shady areas, while others like the sun. Some varieties do better in warm weather, and others like cooler temperatures.;
, This will help you determine whether your soil is lacking a necessary ingredient for a green lawn.


Your lawn may need boosters to create richer soil. Your local lawn care shop should have the boosters you need for a green lawn.
Providing sufficient nutrients is important to getting green grass. Depending on the elements your soil needs, you may be able to correct problems with fertilizers, which release nutrients over a period of time.
You don't have to use poisonous or harsh chemicals to fertilize your soil. Humus, organic matter broken down, has the ability to fight weeds, insects and disease, especially when you use the hardier native plants.

, If you recently planted new seed, be sure to water it every day.


The best time of the day to water your lawn is early in the morning. The water will be less likely to evaporate, and there are generally lower winds. Watering the grass in high wind can cause the grass to dry before the water penetrates the soil.
For a green lawn, water your grass until the water penetrates at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) deep into the soil.
Make watering the grass part of your lawn care during the summer. You may need to water the yard at additional times to prevent the grass from drying out.
Grass needs to be watered about one inch per week. If you use sprinklers, you can place a can in your yard and see how much water filled the can after you water one hour. This will give you the hourly rate of using sprinklers to water your lawn.

, The Nitrogen stimulates green foliage and the magnesium sulfate makes the foliage retain water so the foliage is thicker and greener. After you throw it on your lawn, hose down the grass to make the chemicals go down into the roots. This is way cheaper than Nitrogen based grass fertilizer and works well on grass.

, In doing so, you will help your lawn heal better from the recent cut. This can prevent the tips of the grass from becoming brown.

,,, The process of aeration makes small holes in the surface of your lawn, allowing water, nutrients and air access to the roots.


Aeration allows better drainage, which reduces runoff.

, Thick grass chokes out weeds and makes it harder for them to grow or spread within your lawn.

Consider the ground you are hoping to place your shed on.,
Find a spot that will allow you to access all sides of your shed.,
Keep water and electricity in mind when selecting your shed location.,
Take a moment to think about how the shed will affect your yard.,
Clear the space where you plan to put your shed.,
Remove the stump of any trees you cut down.,
Eliminate any weeds in the area.,
Level the ground where you plan to build your shed.,
Check the temperature.,

Fill the remaining space with concrete.,
Use paving slabs to make your hard standing.,
Excavate the ground to create a hole that is three inches deep.,
Measure the depth of your paving slabs.",How to Prepare Your Garden for a Shed," Try to find a spot where the ground can be easily leveled. This means you should try to avoid spots that have a slope or are very rocky, as these characteristics will make it harder for you to level the ground.


Try to find a spot that is already relatively level to make the process as easy as possible for yourself.;
, You will need to be able to access every side of your shed so that you can make repairs and maintain it throughout the year. You should also consider the roof of your shed; tree branches can rub away roof felt. When picking your spot, try to avoid:


Putting your shed too close to walls or fences. You should be able to walk all the way around your shed.
Putting your shed too close to trees or shrubs that will need pruning. As mentioned above, tree branches can damage the roof of your shed.
Putting your shed on a boggy patch of ground. The ground should be fairly dry underneath your shed to keep it from sinking into the earth.

, If you need water or electricity running to your shed, you will need to run water or power lines to the area.

, The entrance to your shed will most likely be a high-traffic area, which may cause a bald spot to form on your lawn. You should also consider whether or not your shed will affect your neighbors at all; will your shed block their view, or disrupt them (if you will be using power tools)?


When placing your shed, you may also want to put it somewhere that is quiet, or has a pretty view that you can look at when taking a break.

, Cut down or cut back any trees or shrubs that may be in the way. Keep in mind that it will be harder to care for and trim any shrubs or branches in the back or on the sides of your shed.


If you plan to keep some trees or shrubs in these areas, consider keeping a path clear that runs all the way around your shed.

, While cutting down trees to allow you to build your shed is a large job, removing the stump is equally as important. If some roots or a part of the stump are left behind, there is a chance that the tree will regrow, which could cause damage to your shed.


You can use a stump killer purchased at a garden supply store, or you can spread Epsom salts to kill the roots and plant before digging it out of the ground.

, You may be surprised how strong weeds are; some can punch up through the floor of your shed even if it’s built of concrete. Because of this, it is important to get rid of these weeds before you build your shed. To get rid of weeds, you can:


Use chemical weed controllers.
Dig the weeds out by hand.
Lay down horticultural fabric that will effectively keep weeds from growing by blocking their light source.

, Your shed will need a level surface to stand on. An uneven surface will cause problems later, such as causing the shed to warp. If the ground is uneven, start by leveling this out. If you do not know how to level ground, click here for more information.


If you are making a flat surface on a slope, take steps to prevent ground slide later on. You may need to shore the earth back to prevent this from happening.
If you can’t level the ground so that it is absolutely flat, don’t get too stressed. You can compensate for an uneven surface by excavating a deeper base for the shed and then putting in concrete and leveling it to create a flat surface.

, Make sure temperatures are above freezing before laying your concrete shed base. You should also try to avoid very hot and dry temperatures, as these temperatures may cause the concrete to set too quickly.


If it rains after laying the concrete mix, cover the area with a tarpaulin.

, It is important that you construct a hard standing that is slightly larger than your shed’s footprint. Try to make it about three or four inches wider than the shed base along each side.


Mark this area out using pegs and string.

, Dig out the area you have marked off so that the large, shallow hole you create is about six inches deep. Before laying your concrete, place weed protection fabric in the bottom of this area. Once you have laid the fabric into the hole:


Fill the hole halfway up with rubble or gravel. Level this layer with sand, or rake over the gravel to give it an even surface. This layer will help with drainage and to keep the area level.

, Use timber or steel shuttering to make an edge all around the hole you have dug.


The edge should be roughly three inches deep and level with the surface of the ground.

, Once you have created the edge, fill the remaining three-inch depth with concrete. Pour the concrete so that the concrete is level with the surrounding ground.


Smooth out the surface using a block of wood to get a smooth finish. Leave the concrete to set.

, Paving slabs are square pieces of stone that you can use as a hard standing. To do this, begin by marking out the area of your shed base using pegs and string.


If you do not want to use paving slabs, you can also use slabs of pressure-treated timber.

, Once you have dug this shallow hole, lay weed protection fabric in the bottom to keep any weeds from growing up under your shed.

, Your paving slabs should be slightly higher than ground level when they are placed in your hole. Fill about half of the hole with concrete.


Use a rake to level off the concrete. Once the concrete has set, cover the area with paving slabs.

Remove the frame once the floor is dry and you can easily lift the boards.,
Step on and use the floor only once it is completely dry.",How to Pour a Garage Floor,"


Your frame will keep in the cement fix and delimit the area of your floor. Use four simple wooden boards pushed against the walls of the garage and secured either by weights or nailed together.;
,,,, This is best done from the end of the wheelbarrow, evening with the trowel as you move along. Pour 3 inches (or 5 cm).

,


These bars will provide strength to the concrete. Have the bars prepared before pouring. Allowing the concrete to dry too much between pours will create layers and make the concrete weaker. To attain an even floor, pouring slowly and evenly.

, Go as high as you wish your floor to be.

, Ensure an even floor by checking that there are no air pockets or pools of cement in the corners.

, Check that no air bubbles or other irregularities form.

, If the boards are hard to lift, let the floor sit for another day.

, Tap the surface with a boot or a hammer to make sure it is solid and free of cracks.

Remove old grass and weeds using a grape hoe or sod cutter. If necessary, apply glyphosate or another broadleaf herbicide to remove these weeds. Follow label instructions and wait the required time after applying before breaking and prepping the soil.

Grade your soil to a 1 or 2% slope running away from buildings.Perform a soil test or send soil samples to a local university extension or a garden center that offers soil testing services.

Improve soil if necessary based on soil test results, then gently rake in starter fertilizer.
Water the soil and let settle for one week.Fill a garden roller ⅓ full of water and roll lightly over the soil.;
, Take your time selecting a grass species. Lawn care will be much easier if the grass is suited to your climate, soil type, and use patterns. Research the specific species, not just ""cool season"" or ""warm season"" grass.


You'll also choose between seed and sod (turf). Seed is cheaper and easier to install, but can take months to become usable. Pick sod if you want a lawn sooner, and are willing to spend the time and effort.
Sod should be moist, with no dry or cracked areas.

, Break up the lawn into sections to make this task more manageable. Follow these instructions:


To plant seeds: Using a lawn spreader, sow half the seeds walking in parallel rows. Sow the other half in rows at right angles to the first rows. Lightly rake ⅛ inch (3 mm) of soil over the seeds.To install sod: Remove a few inches of soil, so the new sod will end up level with the surrounding area. Lay the sod end to end in staggered rows, as though laying bricks. Trim edges to fit with a utility knife.

, Follow these guidelines to keep a new lawn healthy:


Seeds: Water right after sowing, lightly to avoid washing away the seeds. Repeat every other day or as often as needed to keep the soil moist, as seeds may die when dried out. This danger has passed once the seed has germinated and grass blades appear, usually about 10–14 days after planting.
Sod: Water well after installing, then use a full lawn roller to compact the sod against the soil base. From then on, water in the early morning 10 days. Water heavily enough to wet the soil underneath the sod, but avoid overwatering that can lift the sod rolls up from the soil.

, Avoid walking on new sod for the first week after installation, and go easy on it for the first month. Seed takes longer to become established. Stay off it until blades appear, then use as lightly as possible for six months.


Once a seed-grown lawn reaches a height of 2–3 inch (5–7.5cm), roll it with an empty garden roller.
Do not mow a seed-grown lawn until it is 3 or 4 inches (7.5–10cm) tall, then mow no more than ½ inch (1.25 cm) every few days until the lawn is healthy and well-established., Deep roots keep your lawn healthy and lush. Promote root growth by watering heavily, then letting the top 2 inches (5cm) of soil dry out before watering again. The exact amount of water per week depends on the grass variety and weather. A good rule of thumb for the growing season is 1–1.5 inches (2.5–3.25 cm) of water per week, rising to 2 inches (5cm) during hot, dry weather.Water in late evening or early morning to reduce water loss from evaporation.
To find out how many inches of water your sprinkler uses, set up open containers around your yard. Run the sprinklers for 20 minutes, then measure the depth of water in each can. Multiply the average depth by three to find the inches per hour.

, Many grass species survive hot, dry summers by going dormant. Their leaves turn brown, but the parts undergrounds stay alive for months. If your lawn wilts and turns brown no matter how much you water it, letting it go dormant can be healthier than repeatedly rescuing it from the brink.


Most dormant grass does not need watering. If the soil is extremely dry or the grass species does not do well in hot weather, give the lawn 0.25–0.5 inches (6–12mm) water every 2–4 weeks., Cutting grass to a tall height (around 3 1⁄2 to 4 inches (8.9 to 10.2 cm)) is important for lawn health, especially during summer heat. Taller grass shades the ground, which blocks weed sprouts and promotes beneficial microbes. Leaving the grass tall also allows your lawn to focus on root growth, which adds disease resistance. Leave the grass clippings on the lawn after mowing to return the nutrients to your lawn.


Do not mow within a week of planting new grass. The grass will not have time to grow deep enough roots and can be pulled up by the mower.
Never mow a wet lawn. The slippery grass could cause an accident, and some mowers will not work as efficiently.

Sharpen your mower blade after about 10 hours of mowing, or if fresh-mowed grass looks ragged with brown tips.
If you hate the look of a tall lawn, you may reduce the height as low as 2 inches (5cm). Some grass species handle this better than others, but all prefer 3 inches (7.5cm) or above.
Never remove more than ⅓ of the grass height at a time. You may need to cut some lawns every two or three days in spring to keep it at the right height.
Mow in a different direction or pattern than your last mow to help the grass grow more evenly.

, The three numbers on the fertilizer bag tell you the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, in that order. Nitrogen is the most important for your lawn, and should be higher than the other two (a 3:1:2 ratio is ideal).Avoid numbers higher than 10, since these can easily burn your lawn.


Ideally, choose a mixture of 30–50% slow-release fertilizer and 70–50% fast release fertilizer. This gives the lawn an instant boost, but still slowly adds more nutrients over the next few weeks.
Organic fertilizers are better than synthetic fertilizers, since they improve soil health as well.

, If you don't have a fertilizer spreader, rent one from a tool rental company. A drop spreader works best for small lawns. A broadcast (rotary) spreader saves time when fertilizing large lawns, but must be kept away from lawn edges, water sources, and vegetable and flower gardens to avoid pollution.Follow instructions on the spreader and your fertilizer packaging to apply 1 lb of nitrogen over every 1,000 square feet of lawn (0.5 kg / 100 m2). Do this once a year, preferable in late fall when the cool weather promotes root growth instead of leggy growth.


To avoid stripes of uneven color, set the spreader to ½ the recommended setting and walk over the lawn twice, in two sets of rows at right angles to each other.
Put on gloves and hand spread fertilizer in corners, edges and small, tight areas to avoid spreading fertilizer outside the lawn.
If you want the perfect lawn, you may fertilize three or four times per growing season. It's easy to burn your lawn or cause excessive quick growth with this strategy. For best results, contact a local university extension for advice specific to your climate.

, Annual de-thatching and aeration is very important for the health of your lawn. Once a year, remove plugs of soil using a lawn aerator with ½ in (1.25 cm) diameter tines. Remove them to a depth of 3 inches (7.5cm), passing over the lawn until you have about 8 plugs per square foot (88 per square meter). This fights soil compaction, disease, and thatch buildup.


Aerate while the soil is on the dry side, but just wet enough to allow the tines to penetrate.

, If water runs off the lawn, you likely have clay soil or a steep slope. Give the lawn half as much water as usual, wait one hour for water to drain, then give it the other half. Stick to this system for all areas where runoff is an issue.


Heavy clay soils require even deeper and less frequent watering than a normal lawn.
Aerating your lawn can help if your soil feels dense and compacted..

, If your lawn wilts; turns a little grey, purple, or blue; or holds the impression of footprints, it's on the dry side. Increase the amount of water you give it each session.


Dry lawns can also be caused by sandy soil, which drains too quickly for the lawn to absorb the water. Water sandy areas more often to make up for this, with less water per session.

, The best way to fight weeds is to maintain a good, thick and healthy turf with its own natural defenses. Most weeds can be treated with basic changes to your lawn care, such as a higher mowing height or a change in watering schedule.If weeds are still a problem, pull them by hand and seek advice from local gardeners and university extensions. Chemical herbicides should be a last resort due to the risks of pollution and damage to surrounding plants.


If you decide to use an herbicide, always follow the label instructions exactly. Following local advice tailored to specific weeds will give best results. When choosing an herbicide for an existing weed problem, choose a postemergence herbicide. Selective herbicides kill specific species, while nonspecific herbicides will kill your lawn as well and must be applied very precisely.
If you use a lawn spreader or other equipment to spread herbicide, traces may remain on the equipment and spread to other areas of the garden., If lawn grubs, beetles, or other pests are eating your lawn, the best approach is usually a change to your lawn care. A local university extension can help you fight pests local to your area — and tell you which pests are actually harming your lawn. Pesticides and insecticides should be a last resort only, as they can kill beneficial soil microbes and earthworms. If you do decide to use them, follow label instructions exactly.


Pesticides can also be dangerous for the person applying them. Wear protective equipment as instructed by the label. After application, wash your skin and clothing thoroughly before eating, drinking, or smoking., Thatch, the spongy layer of brown material atop the soil, can cause issues if allowed to grow past 0.5 inch (1.25cm) thick. Rent a thatch removal machine to break it apart, and leave the thatch to decompose on the lawn. Once the thatch is gone, topdress the lawn with a sprinkle of soil — but always use the same soil the lawn was planted in.


Remove the thatch in early fall or very early spring only. Do not remove thatch less than 0.5 inches (1.25 cm) thick.
Thatch buildup can also be caused by poor drainage. Aerating the soil as described above can help.
Contrary to popular belief, grass clippings do not contribute to thatch growth.

, In many areas, including most of the Eastern US and Midwest, soil is too acidic and needs a light annual sprinkling of pelletized calcium carbonate lime. For a more accurate approach, conduct a soil test and adjust pH until it is between 6.0 and 7.0. Your soil test kit may also indicate nutrient deficiencies, such as low phosphorus or iron, which can be adjusted with a different fertilizer or soil addition products.



Any time of year is fine for liming.
If your soil is too alkaline, lower the pH with sulfur gardening products.

, The practices above all help your lawn resist disease. If you see discolored grass or other signs of disease, try to identify the specific disease and ask a local expert for advice on lawn diseases in your area. There are a couple steps you can take that will help fight most diseases:


Avoid excessive watering. The grass should never be soaked or swampy.
Switch your watering schedule to after midnight or in the early morning. Water applied in the early evening does not go through evapotranspiration, and stands on the turf instead. This can promote fungus and diseases, such as red thread fungus in perennial rye.
Shake off dew drops on the grass with a quick hose spray, or by dragging the hose over the top. Some ""dew"" is actually sugary water exuded by the plant, which microbes can feed on., Any time your lawn looks damaged, minimize the amount of foot and vehicle traffic until it returns to health. The same applies to lawns during frost, which are especially vulnerable.

Know your grass.,
Do a pH soil test.,
Measure your lawn.,
Select a fertilizer that meets your lawn's needs.,
Choose a type of fertilizer.",How to Fertilize a Lawn1," The type of grass you have will determine what type of fertilizer you need to use, and how often you need to fertilize. Some regions have primarily warm season grasses, while others have primarily cool season grasses. If you don't know what type of grass is growing in your yard, ask your neighbors who have similar grass, or take a sample to your local garden center.









Warm season grasses grow primarily in the southern regions of the US. They include St. Augustine, Bahia, Carpetgrass, Centipede, Bermuda, Zoysia, and Buffalo, among others. These grasses turn brown in the fall after the first frost of the year.
Cool season grasses grow primarily in the northern regions of the US. They include Fine Fescue, Bluegrass, bentgrass, and ryegrass. Cool season grasses are more cold-tolerant, but will still fade to a light tan or brown color during the coldest winter days in most climates.
Both warm and cool season grasses can grow in the middle regions of the US.;
, This measures the alkalinity or acidity of the soil, and helps to determine what pH your fertilizer should have. You can buy pH testing kits for soil at garden stores or online. Follow the instructions on your kit to determine your soil's pH. If your soil has high acidity or alkalinity, you'll need to pick out a fertilizer that will balance things out for optimal growth.









Take samples from multiple locations and various depths, up to 10 to 12 inches (25–30cm). Record all the results for later reference.
For more detailed information about your lawn's nutrients, send the soil samples into a soil testing lab or your local agriculture extension.

, You'll need to know the square footage in order to buy the right amount of fertilizer. Multiply the length of your yard by its width to find out the square footage. Make sure you subtract the areas that won't need to be fertilized, like your home and any landscaped areas.








, Now that you know your type of grass and your soil pH, choose a fertilizer that provides the necessary nutrients.

Fertilizers are always labeled with three distinct numbers, representing these nutrients in this order: nitrogen (N) for leaf growth, phosphorous (P) for development of roots, flowers, seeds & fruit, and potassium (K) for stem growth, water movement in plant, flowering & fruiting. Most lawns do well with a 3:1:2 or 4:1:2 fertilizer.If you used a soil testing lab, the report may recommend that you look for a fertilizer or soil addition with extra nutrients. Possibilities include the three macronutrients calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S), as well as the micronutrients copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese, (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), zinc (Zn), boron (B). Occasionally specialized plants or soil conditions will require silicon (Si), cobalt (Co), vanadium (V), or other rare mineral catalysts.

, Even once you here are a lot of different types of fertilizer to choose from, and it's good to do a little research before picking one. Ask for help at your garden store if you have trouble deciding. Here are some factors to keep in mind:









You can get either liquid or granular fertilizer. Liquid fertilizers work quickly, but they're also absorbed quickly so they need to be reapplied every few weeks. Granular fertilizers are sprinkled across the lawn and get absorbed more slowly.
Choose between quick release and slow release granular fertilizers. Slow release fertilizers only need to be applied once or twice in a growing season.
Choose between chemical or organic fertilizer. You can get fertilizer that also kills weeds, but using an organic fertilizer is better for your lawn's health in the long term.

Build the shed up off of the ground.,
Paint the outside with waterproof paint.,
Caulk gaps in the shed's main structure.",How to Weatherproof a Shed1," If you are building a new shed, it is important to build it on supports rather than directly on the ground. Use cinder blocks or other stone shed supports, or use treated wood to build a framework that keeps it off of the ground.Building the shed on supports keeps groundwater from soaking into it.
Your options are limited if your shed is already sitting directly on the ground. You could use heavy machinery to lift the shed and then add a support structure under the shed.
Most sheds installed by professionals are built up off of the ground.;
, Go to the hardware store and look in the paint aisle or speak to an employee. Choose an exterior paint that is specifically labelled as waterproof. Paint the entire exterior of the shed, including all four sides and the roof.This creates a water-repelling barrier so the water is not absorbed.
If you are painting in conjunction with felting the roof, paint the roof in between cleaning the roof and applying the new felt.

, Grab a caulking gun and some all-purpose, exterior caulk. Look carefully for gaps at the corners and edges of the shed. Check the walls and the ceiling for holes or spaces between boards. Fill any gaps that you find with caulk."

Use your power edger or weed wacker primarily around sidewalks and footpaths.,
Use your power edger along straight lines and right angles.,
Walk holding the edging tool completely level and rigid.,
If you can, walk on the sidewalk or footpath as you edge.,
Edge slowly but surely, taking time so that you don't have to rehash the same territory too many times.,
Get familiar with your half-moon manual edging tool.,
Use your manual edging tool to create fluid or flowing edges.,
Be careful of electrical wires, plumbing pipes, and other subterranean hazards as you edge.,
Edge around flower beds and planters with a manual edge.,
Decide how you want to tackle trees and shrubs.",How to Edge a Lawn," When you edge your lawn, you have two options for which tool to use: You can use an electric or gas-powered edging tool, or you can use a manual edging tool. (We'll explain about the manual edging tool later.) Because you don't have the space to dig out extra mulch or dirt around sidewalks and footpaths, it's best to use a power edger in these situations. Power edgers will make short work of these borders.


Opt for a power edger that is cheap, light, and straight. You can get power edgers relatively inexpensively, and you should — because who wants to spend a bunch of money on an edger? Opt for a light edger because you could spend longer amounts of time holding it up. And finally, unless you feel you need the ""ergonomic"" option, go for an edger with a straight body; it'll be easier to define a straight edge with one of these tools.
When you purchase the edger, buy one or two replacement blades for it as well. The blades can really take a beating, even with the most practiced person running the edger. Be sure you also understand how to change out the blades when needed.
There are some models of weed whackers that feature a multi-head design, meaning you can convert it into three or four other tools. This will cost considerably more than a straight weed wacker, but it may be worth it.
Be sure you also have all the necessary safety equipment, including safety goggles/eyewear, long pants and boots, and earplugs.;
, A power edger is much more efficient than a manual edger, but that doesn't mean that it always gets the job done better. A power edger is great around straight lines, or lines where a raised footpath can guide you. A power edger is not so great around lines where the boundaries aren't so well defined; in these areas, where you want the edge to flow, it's best to use a manual edging tool if you can afford to.

, You want your body to move, not your arms. So turn the edging tool on, give it a little bit of power, and start slowly walking with the tool, holding your arms steady. Moving your body instead of your arms will ultimately make the cut on the grass much straighter.

, Instead of walking on the grass itself when you edge, walk on the sidewalk or footpath. Here's why: when you hold the edger out with your arms, your body naturally wants to bring your arms back closer to your body. If this happens when you're standing on the lawn itself, you start cutting into the lawn instead of merely lopping off the farthest edge. Over time, you'll find yourself redefining the edge each time (farther into your lawn) instead of using the same edge as a guide.


If you're standing on the sidewalk while edging, however, your body's impulse to bring in your arms as you move along the border means much less damage, because you'll be edging air when your body autocorrects. This is an easy problem to fix, because it's not a problem at all.
In addition, the sidewalk or pathway is most likely a more even, flatter surface than the lawn. Walking on the sidewalk can help you keep a steady pace.

, Power edgers are, well, powerful, so it's tempting to blaze through your lawn in record time. Too often, however, lazy execution produces lazy results. Take your time when you edge using a power tool. You'll find that you won't have to re-edge the same spot over and over again to achieve a clean look. Re-edging the same spot over and over again is likely to lead to a sloppy look.


Remember to locate and mark any sprinkler heads to avoid damaging them.

, Your half-moon edger has a large blade in the shape of a half moon with an overhanging lip in the middle of the circle. This lip hits against soil at a uniform level every time you drive the half-moon into the ground, producing an even depth with each edge.


Simply drive the edging tool into the ground as you would a shovel, down until the lip hits soil, rocking the edger from side to side, and then pull the handle back gently to dig soil and define your edge. Once you've defined your edges, take a shovel and shovel up any loose soil or mulch into a wheelbarrow.
When using a manual edging tool, drive the half-moon into the ground completely straight (vertically), not at an angle. Not only will this help define your edge more clearly, but it will also inhibit the growth of rhizomes from growing into the edges of your lawn.
Maintain your edging tool. Clean off any dirt or debris after each use. File away the edges of the half moon periodically to keep them sharp. There's nothing better than a sharp tool, and nothing worse than a dull one.

, Against the slight curve of a planting bed, the edging tool works fantastically. Simply spray paint your curved edge or lay down a garden hose onto the edge you want to create, and edge away. Of course, if you decide to use a garden hose as your guide, be extremely careful not to accidentally cut into it with your edging tool.

, Although they may be covered with PVC pipe that's difficult to cut into with an edger, it's better to be safe than sorry. Talk to your utilities company before edging out any large stretch of lawn and remember to edge gingerly.


Before doing any digging, call the 811 Nationwide Locate call center and request that they locate any buried utilities. There is no charge of this service.

, Flower beds and planters are perfect for using a manual edge because you can afford to take away a little soil or mulch when you edge. The process is the same. Just remember not to take away too much lawn when you edge; try to achieve the balance of taking away just enough to clearly define the edge but not so much that you've significantly reduced your lawn space.

, The lawn around trees and shrubs can be edged either with a power edger or a half-moon. When using a half-moon, however, be especially careful of root growth. If the tree or shrub is older or has an extensive root system, consider edging with a power edger instead of actually digging into the soil and potentially cutting up roots.

Obtain the proper equipment.,
Fertilize at the right time of year.,
Prepare the spreader.,
Start fertilizing.,
Water your lawn.This helps the soil absorb the fertilizer so your lawn will begin seeing its benefits right away.








",How to Fertilize a Lawn2," The equipment you use can make a difference in the results of your lawn fertilization. If you have a large lawn, you might need to buy or rent equipment designed to evenly spread fertilizer throughout your yard.









Choose a rotary spreader for larger lawns.
Pick a drop spreader for smaller lawns or for lawns with areas that need precise fertilizing, such as around flower beds and landscaping.

, In order to your fertilizer to work best, you'll need to time it so that you fertilize at the beginning of the growing season. This is different for different types of grasses.









Fertilize warm season grasses when the grass begins to turn green at the beginning of spring. Fertilize the lawn again just after the hottest part of the summer is over.
Fertilize cool season grasses after the heat of the summer is over, since their growing season gets under way in early fall. You can use a Winterizer fertilizer toward the end of the summer to protect the grass over the fall and winter. Fertilize again early in the spring, making sure the fertilizer is timed to be used up before the hot summer weather begins., Open and close your spreader while it is empty to ensure that it works properly. Fill the spreader with the appropriate fertilizer for the time of year and needs of your lawn. Check the packaging to see the recommended amount. Adjust the spreader so the release of fertilizer matches the recommended dosage on the fertilizer bag.








, Choose a place in your yard to begin and open the mechanism on the spreader. Walk at a normal pace while spraying the fertilizer. Remain as constant as possible without stopping, slowing or speeding your pace or turning off the spreader.









Cover your entire yard with the fertilizer. Be cautious about not overlapping or skipping areas.
Be sure not to spread too much fertilizer. Your yard could experience chemical burn if you aren't careful.
Clean your spreader when you're finished. Spray the inside and the outside of the spreader with a water hose.

Check that the doors and windows are sealed.,
Apply weatherstripping around windows and doors.,
Insulate the inside of the shed.",How to Weatherproof a Shed2," Always close the doors, and check to make sure they fit against the shed tightly so that nothing gets in. If there are windows that open, make sure they are shut tight any time you are away from the shed. Look around doors and windows for gaps that need to be filled., If your windows and doors don't already have foam seals around them, add some. Foam weatherstripping usually comes in a roll and is easy to apply around door frames and windows. It creates a seal for gaps between doors and windows and the frame of the building., Insulation creates a waterproof layer around the inside structure of the shed. Staple insulation to the support studs of the shed, not to the outside paneling. Insulate the roof, as well as the walls.Bubble wrap is a cheap and effective way to insulate a shed, but you can also use standard fiberglass insulation.
Stapling insulation to the studs creates a small air pocket between the outer paneling and the insulation, which helps reduce moisture.

Nail the felt down with galvanized clout nails.,
Overlap the second piece over the first piece.,
Nail felt to the second side of the roof.,
Center a final piece of felt over the apex so it overlaps both sides of the roof.",How to Weatherproof a Shed3," Measure the length and width of one side of the roof. Multiply those numbers to get the area of that side. If the shed is a basic A-frame, multiply that number by two to get the total area of the roof. If the roof has an irregular shape, find the area of each part of the roof.You’ll need to set up a ladder so you can reach the roof. You may also want to have someone on another ladder at the other end of the roof to help you.
Write the numbers down so you don’t forget them.

, Go to the local hardware or home improvement store and locate roof felt. Use the roof area numbers that you wrote down when you measured to ensure that you buy enough felt to cover the entire roof.If you have multiple options of roof felt, you’ll have to choose what is in your price range and seems like quality felt.

, Climb up the ladder with a scraper of some kind. A scraper on a long pole is most effective. Position the scraper under the old felt or shingles and work it forward and backward so the roof covering comes loose. If the felt is nailed down or glued tight, this can be time consuming.Be sure to dispose of the felt in the garbage once it is all removed.

, Use a claw hammer or another nail removing tool to pull any nails that are crooked or sticking up from the roof. Any nails that are hammered flush with the roof decking can be left in place. Use a wet rag to wipe down the surface if it seems grimy.Be sure to toss the nails into a bucket or trash barrel so they don’t end up in your yard. Loose nails can pop mower tires or end up in someone’s foot if you leave them on the ground.

, As mentioned above, weatherproof paint or primer adds an extra layer of sealant, even if you're covering the roof with felt. Paint the roof at the same time that you paint the rest of the shed, or paint it separately when you are focused on felting the shed., Unroll the felt horizontally along the length of the roof. Be sure to hang the felt about an inch over the edge of the roof so that water will run off.The width of the rolls of felt you bought and the size of the roof will determine how many pieces of felt you need to lay.

, The exact type of nail you use can vary, but it’s important to use galvanized nails to insure that they don’t rust. Pound nails into the felt as you unroll it so that it stays in place. Nail around the entire perimeter of the felt, putting a nail roughly every 30cm (about every foot).You’ll need to use nails that are at about 20mm (⅘ inch) long to ensure they go through the felt and secure into the roof.

, When the first piece of felt is nailed in place, unroll the second piece horizontally as before. Make sure that it slightly overlaps the first piece to aid the flow of water. Nail the second piece in place as before.

Cover the whole side of the roof in this way. You may only need one or two pieces, depending on the size of the roof and the size of the felt roll. If you only need to use one piece, move to the other side of the roof.

, Cover the second part of the roof in the same way you covered the first side. Start at the bottom and hang a bit of felt over the edge. Nail the felt in place as you go along. Be sure to overlap each piece on top of the one before it., When both sides of the roof are felted, lay one final piece on the top point of the roof. You don’t have to use a piece that is the full width of the roll. Cut it down to one foot or so, making sure it covers the crack of the apex and overlaps each side of the roof.Since the felt on the sides of the roof form a crack at the top, it’s important to cover this with a final solid piece.

,
Water the lawn thoroughly to help the grass recover quickly from the de-thatching process.

",How to Dethatch a Lawn1,"


Look at your lawn and ask yourself these questions: Is the lawn green on top but brown on the bottom? Does it look brown and dead after it had been mowed? Does the lawn feel ""spongy"" when walked on? If you answered yes, your lawn may have a thatch problem.






Use a spade or knife to remove a small section of lawn in a few places around the yard.






Measure the thatch layer. If it is greater than 0.5 inches (1 cm), your lawn needs to be dethatched.





;
, This should be in the spring or fall when there is adequate moisture in the soil.


Water the lawn lightly 2 days before de-thatching. Trying to de-thatch a lawn that is too wet or too dry will damage the soil.

,,


Vertical mowers, sometimes called power rakes, chop down through the thatch layer and lift it to the top of the lawn. These machines create a lot of debris that will you need to remove for compost or disposal.






Core aerators pull soil plugs from the lawn, which you can remove or leave on the lawn to decompose naturally. If you rent a core aerifier, have the store operator adjust the teeth spacing of the dethatcher to the appropriate spacing for your type of lawn. Blade height should be about .25 inch (.64 cm) above a hard, flat surface.







,


For example, power rake the entire lawn running north to south. Do the next pass east to west. This will thoroughly break up the thatch on the lawn.

, These can include glufosinate or glyphosate, but you want to make sure that your temperature is warm enough so that the chemicals translocate to the existing plants.

, Apply the lime or other indicated chemical before you till so that it gets mixed into your soil.

, If you have not prepared the ground well enough, seed that sits directly on the surface does nothing more than feed the birds.

,,, This usually happens for established grass after the soil temperature has exceeded 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) for around 3 to 4 weeks.

, This will take care of crabgrass that is trying to emerge. Make sure that the product you use is low in nitrogen so that you don't damage the root system.

, The color can be short-lived, but you can also implement nutrients that have magnesium and sulfur to also give you a greener yard. Only apply such chemicals, though, as dictated by the results of your soil test.

, Ideally, wait at least 4 to 6 weeks after you apply your herbicide treatment.

, This allows for weed control without harming your grass.

Adapt your lawnmower to use for edging.,
Use a scissors to trim small patches of grass at the edge of your lawn.,
Try using a long-handled shears if you are unable to bend or kneel.,
Edge your lawn using a trimmer.",How to Edge a Lawn Without an Edger1," It’s possible to adapt a lawnmower so that it trims the lawn edges. To do this, you’ll need to alter the angle of the blades by loosening the fastenings holding the blades in place. You want to alter the position of the blade so it is about half an inch above the ground on one side.


Once you’ve adjusted the blade, mow the lawn with the lower blade area hitting the edge of the lawn. Try not to cut through the soil when you do this as you will damage the blade. Once you’ve finished, restore the blade to its original position.
Be very careful when working with the cutting parts of the machinery and make sure the power is completely off before you begin. Be warned this method won’t work for all models of lawnmower.;
, You can just use kitchen or garden scissors to trim the grass at the edges of your bed. However, you probably only want to do this if you have a small lawn and don’t mind kneeling.


Get down on your knees – a padded kneeler may help – and cut the fringe of grass where it meets the edge of you lawn.

, If you have a pair of long-handled garden shears, you may find these very useful for edging your lawn.


Make sure the garden shears are sharp, as this makes them safer and more effective. You may like to sharpen them before you begin.
This edging method works especially well if you have problems kneeling or bending.

, You can also try using your string trimmer to cut the grass at the edge of your lawn – you’ll just need a bit of manual co-ordination.


Stand on the lawn edge and start the trimmer. Turn it 90 degrees to the ground. The trimmer will trim along the edges of the lawn, removing the grass blades and trimming the roots – this will prevent the grass from growing in this area and help to maintain a neat edge to your lawn.
Make sure you use the usual protection when using the strimmer: sometimes small rocks and twigs will fly up, so make sure you are wearing eye protection.

Use a spade to edge your lawn while the ground is soft and moist.,
Mark the edge of your lawn and cut the turf.,
Alternatively, use a hovel or hoe to do the edging.",How to Edge a Lawn Without an Edger2," You can edge the turf of your lawn using a square-edged spade. It’s best to apply pressure using your foot, so make sure you are wearing solid-sole shoes or boots when doing this.


You should only attempt to edge turf when the ground is fairly moist as it will be easier to cut through than dry earth.
Avoid edging your beds in winter when the ground is likely to be frozen hard and difficult to work.

, Before you begin, mark out where you want to make the new edge of the lawn. Stick the square spade in the ground to a depth of about 2 inches (5.1 cm).


Put the blade into the ground and put your foot on it, holding the handle firmly. Push down with your foot to cut through the soil. Try rocking gently to cut through the turf.
Push the handle forward and back slightly to loosen the cut edge away from the rest of the turf. It’s helpful to prise the cut area open slightly so you can see where you’ve worked.
Now move the spade’s blade a few inches to the side and cut the next piece away. Continue until you have edged the entire bed.

, You can also use a round-edged or pointed shovel – or even a hoe. This will make it easier to cut through the earth but the effect won’t be as neat. A spade with a flat square blade is better than a curved or pointed tool or hoe.

Push the handle forward and back slightly to loosen the cut edge away from the rest of the turf. It’s helpful to prise the cut area open slightly so you can see where you’ve worked.
Now move the spade’s blade a few inches to the side and cut the next piece away. Continue until you have edged around the entire line.

, Once you've cut and made visible one full line of the bed’s edge, return to the start of your turf cut. Now you want to make another cut about one inch inside the area of the new bed.


Make the second cut at a slight angle towards the first cut you made. The idea is to make a thin strip of turf for easy removal.

, Once you have cut the whole length, get down on your knees. If you’ve made a severing cut through the turf, you should be able to pull up the long one inch wide strip of turf easily.


Now take the spade and remove the remaining turf from inside the new bed area.
You’ll need to dig over and improve the soil ahead of planting.

, Go slowly and maybe find a friend who can work shifts with you. Don't both try to count at once, you will just get confused and end up missing patches or double counting.

, Start by counting, Roman style (four vertical lines, then a diagonal through them every fifth -- that's one group of five), only create columns for clusters, and keep a roman count for clusters of four, five, six blades to a cluster, etc., until you have done exactly one square foot.

, Then do that three more times until you have five square feet all cluster-counted.

,).

, If the lawn has round parts, make them into triangles instead and recall that the area of a triangle is half the base times the height.

,, This is your estimate of how many average blades of grass there are in a typical square foot of lawn, and you even know how the blades are clustered, on average.

, Now you will have your estimate of the entirety!

, Blades of grass are always growing, shorter or longer, and dying, so an exact definition of what constitutes ""a blade"" of grass is arbitrary anyway, right? The whole thing is constantly changing in front of your eyes. You can do two things about that: you can count it twice and measure the change, or count it all more times and measure the rate of change. It'd be better to use Probability, Statistics and Calculus though. There, you would be very accurate at the scale of a fraction of an inch, then multiply that out to all the fractions of an inch contained by the entire lawn. If you, for example, note that in a square centimeter there are, in 20 samples, exactly 25 blades, you may get an excellent estimate for the entire lawn by using 25/20 = 5/4 of a blade/sq. cm. and figuring out how many square meters of lawn there are. 100 * 100 = 10,000 sq. cm. / meter.

Use a sharp tool to cut into the dirt and mark the edge.,
Remove some of the dirt.,
Slope the soil in the bed upwards and away from the base of the edge.,
Use shears to trim the grass along the edge.,
Spread a 2-3 inch thick layer of mulch from the edge to your flowerbed.,
Check the flower bed periodically to keep the edge defined.,
Install a new border edging.",How to Edge a Flower Bed," If there are borders around your flower bed made of plastic, metal, or some other material and you no longer want to use them, pull them carefully out of the ground. Discard this old material.


If you cannot pull this up by hand, try working a small hand trowel or pry bar under the bottom edge and levering it out. Sometimes the edging is anchored with stakes, so be sure to remove them first.;
, If there is an existing border, and you want to keep the edging where it is, then you are ready for the next step. If you want to change where an existing border is positioned, or if you are making a completely new one, then you will need to mark on the ground where you want the border to be. Straight lines can be fine. Many people prefer curved edges, however, and they may make your flower bed look bigger. , You can use a garden hose, string, or marking paint.Put the hose or other marking material on the ground where you want the actual edge to be.

, For best results, use a half-moon-shaped edging hand tool on a long handle. If you'd rather not buy a new tool, use a sharp trowel or spade. A long bladed knife (e.g. sharpened dinner knife) is also very effective.


Follow along the existing edge, if applicable, or the line you have marked out with the hose or other material.
Cut down 4-6 inches into the soil.
Hold the tool firmly, push it into the sod, then use a sawing motion to avoid any stones in the soil.
Cut all the way down along the line marking where you want the edge to be.

, Push a trowel or spade into the line you have cut in the soil, then pull toward yourself at a 45 degree angle. Scoop away the dirt that is pushed up and discard. The goal is to create an edge that goes down from the lawn a few inches at a 90 degree angle. Repeat this step all the way along the line you have cut in the soil to mark the edge.

, This will help keep your flower bed maintained. At the same time, it will help to visually define the edge even more.

, This will give you a very exact edge and improve the look of your flower bed. You will probably have to repeat this step periodically during the growing season if you want to keep the edge perfectly trimmed.You can use a weed whacker or a gas powered edger instead.

, This will deter weeds, and keep your edged bed neat. It will also help to draw attention to the contrast between your lawn and the flowerbed, increasing its aesthetic appeal. If the flower bed is not overgrown, consider installing weed fabric around the plant before adding mulch.

, Over time, your edge may become uneven due to rain, wind, animals, etc. If this happens, use a spade or trowel to cut through any uneven patches and remove the excess dirt. A good time to do this is in the spring at the start of the growing season., If desired, you can install a border around the flower bed to keep the edge defined. This can be a simple plastic or metal sheet, or any solid barrier of your choice.

Determine what type of sod is best for your yard.,
Choose these grasses for regions with cold winters and hot summers that have regular periods of rain.,
Select warm season grasses for the hot, humid climates of the southern United States.,
Consider what the function of your lawn is, taking into account its size and orientation.,
Assess how much time you'll be able to devote to your lawn.,
Inspect the sod thoroughly.",How to Choose Sod for Your Yard," You'll have to weigh several factors before choosing a variety of grass that will become your new lawn, but climate is a primary consideration. Lawn-care experts separate sod types into 2 broad categories.

, They also can go dormant during droughts. These types experience 2 periods of shoot growth annually: in mid-spring and early fall. Some of the most common cool season grasses are bluegrass (Kentucky and rough), ryegrass (annual and perennial) and Bentgrass.

, They have a single, expanded shoot-growth episode during the summer. Most varieties require special care during the winter months, when blades tend to turn brown and areas of the lawn may require reseeding. Popular warm season grasses include St. Augustine, Bermuda, Carpetgrass and Centipede.;
, Certain grasses can withstand foot traffic better than others but wither in shade. Some sod flourishes in sunshine but shouldn't be installed over wide areas.


Heavy use: If you have kids who play in the yard or frequently entertain outdoors, consider grasses that can withstand foot traffic. Bermuda and Zoysia bounce back from stress better than many other types.
Sunlight: If your yard has a northern exposure or is heavily shaded, St. Augustine and Centipede mixtures are excellent options. Bermuda only thrives in bright sunshine.
Soil: All grasses will do well in rich topsoil, but homeowners in arid and subtropical regions may have limited options when choosing new sod. Bahia is popular because it can grow in infertile or sandy ground. Centipede, the ""lazy man's"" grass, also can withstand acidic soil.
Large areas: Centipede is a popular choice in warm regions because it requires no liming and occasional mowing. Expensive sods, like Zoysia, can be cost-prohibitive for large yards.

, Sod is in peak condition when it is first laid, so it usually requires only periodic watering. Once it takes root in its new environment, it will need more care. Check with an expert before you make a final selection. Some types require grow faster than others, requiring extra mowing and edging. Others may need additional fertilization, irrigation and aeration.

, Sod usually is delivered in rolls ranging from 2 feet (0.61 meters) to 10 feet (3.05 m) long and 1 foot (0.3 m) to 2 feet wide. Some of the key things to look for to ensure the health of your sod shipment include:


Uniform, deep-green blades at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) long.
A thick matrix of roots that don't tear easily.
A set-up in no more than 1 inch (2.54 cm) of rich, damp soil.
Lush rolls with no bare patches or thatch.

Spot the weeds growing in your lawn.,
Understand that the broad leaves of weeds make them easier to target.,
Apply your weedkiller in between late spring and early fall.,
Decide whether you are going to do a whole-lawn weedkiller, or use a more targeted product.,
Feed your lawn two weeks before applying the weedkiller.,
Use a spray bottle for manual applications.,
Stop mowing your lawn for awhile.,
Apply the weedkiller when there is some moisture in the soil.,
Try to limit your weedkiller application to two times per year.",How to Control Lawn Weeds1," Weeds generally look different from the rest of your lawn. You may spot flowers appearing, especially if dandelions are a problem for your lawn. You may also notice different patterns, colors and textures appearing in your lawn, indicating the growth of other species of plants.


It can be challenging to spot weeds on a lawn that is closely mown, so put the mower aside for a bit to see if you can spot any patches of weeds growing.;
, Grass is not a broad-leafed plant, while most weeds generally are. This difference makes it easier to target broad-leafed weeds with your chemical weedkillers.


Some weedkillers are even designed to nourish your grass while killing the weeds. Check out products at your local garden supply store.

, Weeds tend to grow most during the months between spring and fall. Avoid spreading the weedkiller at the end of the fall season when the weeds are about to go dormant, as doing this will not do much to stop the weeds from reappearing in the spring.

, You can either apply a general ‘weed and feed’ lawn treatment over the entire lawn, or manually apply a targeted weedkiller to individual weeds that you spot.


If you have a large lawn, consider getting a backpack sprayer to apply the chemicals; it may be easier than continuing to refill the watering can.

, Weedkiller is likely to be more effective if used about two weeks after feeding the lawn. This is because the feed will boost the weed growth and give you more weed surface to drench with weedkiller.


However, do not feed your lawn ahead of time if you are planning on using a weedkiller that also contains fertilizer.

, A spray bottle can make manual applications more efficient. If possible, set the spray bottle to the most streamlined nozzle, rather than a nozzle that will allow weedkiller to turn into mist over your lawn.


If you do not want to use a spray bottle, you can also get a weedkiller gel that you apply directly to the leaves of the weeds.

, Try to apply weedkiller when you haven’t recently mowed the lawn. Doing this allows the leaves of the weeds (those parts that will absorb the weedkiller) to regrow again after the last mowing so that applying the weedkiller is easier.

, It is ideal to apply the weedkiller if there has been rain in the last few days. If you have a sprinkler system, apply the weedkiller in the morning after the grass has dried but when the ground is still wet. Checking for moisture is a good idea because weedkiller can harm your lawn if it is applied when the soil is too dry.


Don’t apply the weedkiller if rain is predicted for that day, as the rain could wash away the weedkiller, making it ineffective.

, Applying weedkiller more often could do damage to your lawn. You should also avoid using weedkiller on a freshly laid lawn.


Wait until the lawn gets established. This should take roughly a year.

Consider manually removing weeds.,
Hoe young weeds.,
Consider trying vinegar as an organic weedkiller.,
Control weeds in your flowerbeds so that they don’t spread to your lawn.,
Maintain your lawn’s health to keep weeds from growing.,
Apply garden lime to your soil.",How to Control Lawn Weeds2," You can manually remove weeds that appear in your lawn by using a thin tool such as a hori hori (thin weeding knife) or a metal weeder, puller or grubber.


All of these tools require you to kneel or bend so consider getting a knee pad if this is a problem. You could also invest in a long-handled tool.

, If you catch weeds when they are still young, you can hoe them up. Try to do this on a dry day so that you can expose the weed roots when you hoe them up. That way, they will dry and die before they can re-root.

, Some homeowners consider vinegar to be an organic method of killing weeds. You should be aware that vinegar kills anything it touches so it’s likely to leave bare patches in your lawn if applied to weeds and grass.


Use caution when applying vinegar and make sure that it is only applied to weeds at their roots.

, To control weeds in your flowerbeds, you can remove them by hand. You can also lay down a layer of mulch that will help to keep weeds from growing in between your plants.

, Try to keep bare patches from forming on your lawn and try to reseed your lawn every fall. A healthy lawn will generally be less susceptible to weeds. Avoid mowing your lawn too closely, as this can weaken the grass.


Apply a slow-release fertilizer to your lawn once a year.
Aerate your lawn every few years.

, If you have acidic soil, consider applying garden lime to the lawn area over winter to discourage the growth of acid-loving weeds.

Adjust your mowing habits.,
Use a smart clock.,
Reduce how much you fertilize.,
Consider reducing unnecessary watering.,
Recycle water.,
Check for leaky sprinklers.",How to Water Your Lawn Efficiently1," Mowing the lawn is essential, but mowing too often or cutting the grass too low can dry out an otherwise healthy lawn. Using the same pattern to mow your lawn can also cause stress to the grass from the repeated wheel tracks that follow the same direction week after week.Try changing the direction(s) you mow in every time you cut the grass. It will help cut down on stress to the lawn, and may also prevent divots from forming in your pattern.Set your mower's wheels to the proper height. There is some variance of recommended heights depending on the type of grass in your yard. Tall Fescue grass, for example, should be kept no shorter than two and a half to three inches, while Bermuda grass should be kept between ¾ of an inch and 1½ inches.;
, If you have an automatic irrigation system, you may want to consider getting a smart clock or smart irrigation controller. These devices regulate how much water is put out by your sprinkler system and typically have some type of rain sensor, which automatically shuts off your sprinklers when it starts to rain.Some state or regional authorities offer rebates or tax incentives for water consumers who install smart irrigation systems. Check with your local water authority to see if you would qualify for such a program., Frequent fertilization of your yard may dry out the lawn. Using too much fertilizer or fertilizing too often will increase the need to water your lawn more frequently and in greater quantities.In late spring and early fall, use a fertilizer that is three parts nitrogen, one part phosphorus, and two parts potassium. This is ideal for maintaining a healthy lawn without needing to over water the grass.Opt for either slow-release fertilizer or a mixture of quick- and slow-release fertilizers for your lawn. Quick-release fertilizer releases all of the nitrogen rapidly, which will require more frequent applications over time.Follow the instructions and recommendations on your fertilizer's packaging label, or read online about how and when to properly apply fertilizer to your lawn., Watering your lawn serves a number of purposes. In addition to keeping the grass at its optimum health, it also reduces airborne dust and helps regulate the temperature of the soil. But if there are parts of your yard that do not get a lot of foot traffic or do not serve an aesthetic purpose (parts of the backyard or side yard, for example), consider reducing how much and how often you water those areas. You can still water them regularly to prevent withering, but they may not need as much water as the rest of the yard.In addition to cutting back on which parts of the lawn you water, you can also reduce evaporation around certain plants or flowerbeds by laying down a layer of organic mulch over the topsoil. This will help conserve water, and may reduce how often you need to water these parts of your yard.

, If you're watering your grass and not a vegetable or fruit garden, you may want to consider recycling water. Rainwater is safe to use, as it is the same water that would otherwise naturally irrigate your yard, though there may be restrictions on how rainwater is collected and harvested depending on where you live.Grey water, the gently-used and non-hazardous water from showers, dish sinks, and washing machine runoff, is not safe to drink but is generally considered safe to use for watering your lawn.If harvesting grey water, be sure to use environmentally-safe soaps and detergents. Try to use products that are considered ""plant friendly,"" meaning they are free from salt, boron, and chlorine bleach.Try collecting rainwater. It's safe to use on any part of your lawn (including vegetable gardens), and it helps cut down on municipal water consumption. Some states in the U.S. have their own laws about the collection and use of rainwater. To find out any requirements or restrictions on collecting and using rainwater in your state, check the American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association website, click the Resources tab, and read the section titled Laws, Rules & Codes.An easy way to get started collecting rainwater is to simply arrange buckets or barrels under the downspout coming off your gutter. If you decide that collecting rainwater is something you'd like to pursue more actively, there are more advanced collection methods, like rain barrels.

, Broken or leaky sprinklers waste a substantial amount of water, and may actually be overwatering parts of your lawn. To cut back on your water bill and conserve water during times of drought, it's important to check your sprinkler system and water faucets and fix or replace any leaky or broken hardware.

Pull weeds frequently.,
Choose the right grass.,
Consider alternatives to turf.",How to Water Your Lawn Efficiently2," Weeds not only take up space in your yard, they also compete for water and nutrients in the soil. When you pull up weeds, be sure that you dig deep enough to remove the entire root system, as pulling out the surface sprouts will not effectively kill the weed.If you must use chemical herbicides on your weeds, use spot applications instead of a broad, whole-yard application. Spraying the entire yard can harm many of the organisms that live in the soil and could potentially pollute your local groundwater system., While it may seem to the untrained eye that grass is simply grass, there are, in fact, many different types of grass. Each variety has its own advantages, depending on the climate and region in which you live.Perennial Ryegrass is somewhat drought tolerant, easy to establish across the lawn, and can compete well with weeds that sprout up in the yard.Tall Fescue grass is very drought tolerant and has the deepest root system of all turf grasses, running anywhere from three to six feet deep. Tall Fescue doesn't necessarily use less water, but it does use water the same way a deep-root plant would use water. It also stays green during drought, which is advantageous if you live in a drought-prone climate.Fine Fescue grass has a low fertilizer requirement and a high drought tolerance. It can actually go dormant during dry periods when water is absent, and will quickly come back to a healthy shade of green once water is returns.Bentgrass grows well during cool weather, and much like Fine Fescue it can also go dormant during droughts. Bentgrass does not require very much fertilizer, either.Kentucky Bluegrass grows best in cool, humid, semi-arid, and temperate climates. This grass variety is moderately drought-tolerant., Whether you have a large yard that is difficult to manage or you simply want a little more diversity in your yard's landscape, there are plenty of options for non-turf alternatives. Some drought-stricken communities may even offer incentives to homeowners who opt for non-turf alternatives, so it may be worth checking online or with your local department of natural resources to see if your region offers these incentives.


Ground cover makes a fine substitute for turf in some yards. Ground cover, like drought-resistant plants, are ideal for low-traffic parts of the yard. Planting ground cover in slanted parts of the yard that tend to lose a lot of water may also help conserve some water and promote a greener yard.Perennials, shrubs, and trees are all excellent alternatives to grass. Many of these plants have drought-resistant varieties that can help control erosion and water loss.Hardscapes, like decking or pavement (including stepping stones), can help cut back on how much you need to water your yard. Hardscapes also create recreation space, as a deck or patio makes an excellent place to sit outside for picnics, meals, or simple downtime."

Evaluate your soil type.,
Decide when to water.,
Determine how often to water.,
Measure your sprinkler output.,
Calculate the exact amount of water optimal for your lawn.",How to Water Your Lawn Efficiently3," The type of soil under your lawn, as well as the climate and time of year, will dictate how often you need to water your lawn. If you live in an area that is prone to heavy rainfall during parts of the year, for example, you will not need to water as frequently. Certain yards may not reap the full benefits of rainfall, however, depending on the yard's composition and layout.Certain soil types absorb water better than others. A high composition of clay, for example, will prevent water from absorbing into the soil.Clay tends to retain an average around 1.5 inches of water per foot of soil, while fine sand and loamy sand retain the least amount of water at 0.7 and 0.8 inches of water per foot of soil, respectively.Silty loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam have the highest water retention of all soil types, averaging 2.4 inches of water per foot of soil.The layout of the yard is a factor as well. A sloped lawn will not be able to absorb much excess water. Any moisture not readily absorbed will most likely run off downhill., Certain times of day are better than others when watering your lawn. Timing will also vary depending on your climate. It may come as no surprise that where you live may be the biggest factor in when and how often you need to water your lawn.


If you live in a humid climate, you should water your lawn between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM for optimum results.In hot, arid climates, it's best to water lawns in the still hours of the early morning, before sunrise. This will help reduce the amount of water that would otherwise be lost to daytime evaporation and winds.In cooler temperatures, it's best to water your lawn before 10:00 AM or after 6:00 PM. This will minimize evaporation., While some may feel that the lawn should be watered on a daily basis, oftentimes this is not necessary. Many factors influence how often you need to water your lawn. In drought-prone Southern California, for example, you may need to water your lawn anywhere from 20 minutes per week to 200 minutes per week, depending on the region, time of year, and hourly sprinkler output.Use the minimum amount of water necessary to maintain your lawn. Using too much water will run up your monthly water bill, waste vital resources, and may end up damaging your lawn with over-saturation.The best measure for determining how often to water your lawn is to check the lawn itself. If footprints or lawnmower tracks remain indented in the grass for longer than 30 minutes after passing through your yard, it is a good sign that your grass is getting dry.Check the color of your lawn. Turf grass that is dry will often turn to a blueish-gray shade, rather than a lush green.You can also check the soil moisture to see if your lawn needs to be watered. Drive a six-inch screwdriver or stake into the ground. If the screwdriver breaks through the soil easily and without much effort, the soil is likely retaining enough water and you can hold off on watering., One important factor in determining how often to water your lawn is how much water your sprinkler system puts out. You can measure the output of your sprinklers by arranging empty and cleaned tuna cans or cat food cans across your lawn. If you do not have empty cans, several coffee mugs will also work well. Then run the sprinklers for 20 minutes and use a ruler to measure the water depth across the yard.


After 20 minutes, add all the depths together from each container in your yard and divide by the total number of containers to obtain an average for the whole yard. Then multiply that number (the total yard measurements over 20 minutes) by three to average your total sprinkler output per hour (60 minutes).Compare your yard's sprinkler output with your region's recommended monthly watering time. You can find a chart for your region by searching online.

, Each lawn will have its own ideal amount of water necessary for its grass to grow and thrive. This amount depends on factors like the kind of grass growing, soil composition, climate, and so on. You'll need to replenish water that leaves your lawn to keep it healthy, which is best determined by the evapo-transpiration rate (ET).The process of calculating the ET can be complex for some. For a complete explanation on how to find the ET, visit the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) page on calculating it.To make the process of calculating the ET easier for laypeople, the FAO provides ET free calculators on their site.If you've exhausted your wits trying to figure out the ET for your lawn, you may want to inquire about it with a master gardener at your local nursery or greenhouse.

Wipe the sprinkler head clean.,
Inspect the sprinkler head.,
Dislodge debris with a paper clip.,
Rinse clean with the disconnected water hose.",How to Clean Sprinkler Heads1," Disconnect the unit from the water hose. Use a dry cloth to wipe the head of your sprinkler. Wipe it clean of any dirt, mud, silt, or other organic material.;
, Pay special attention to openings in which the water is forced through the sprinklers, and check for any obstructions. Rocks, mud, insects, and lawn clippings are often the culprits and are easily removed., Bend one end of a paper clip or piece of wire and carefully insert into the opening of the sprinkler head. Often this is enough to dislodge dirt and other debris that has built up in the small openings of an oscillating sprinkler.

, For more expensive irrigation systems, you may need to physically take apart the sprinkler head to do this. These systems often contain internal screens that you do not want to puncture by inserting an object directly into the sprinkler head."
"
Mow your lawn once or twice a week.,
Fertilize your lawn once a month, after mowing.,
Water the lawn using rainwater, if possible.,
Give the lawn a good soak rather than a light sprinkle of water.,
Understand that a lawn will usually recover from turning brown.,
Consider whether you need to reseed any bare patches.,
Consider whether you need to aerate the lawn in any particular year.",How to Care for Your Lawn in the Summer1," Mowing your lawn is a one way to keep it in good health. Try to mow your lawn at least once every two weeks, but try to aim for mowing your lawn once or twice a week.Sharpen your lawn mower blade once a year, as a sharper blade will cut your lawn without tugging at the grass.
Try to avoid cutting the grass too short, especially when the weather is very hot. During hot weather, your lawn has to put a lot of energy into regrowing grass shoots.;
, Most lawn fertilizers can be applied after mowing. Consider feeding your lawn once a month over the summer to help it stay healthy during the hot summer months.

, Grass can turn brown quickly during dry periods. Watering a lawn can use up a lot of water, especially if you are using processed tap water. Instead of using the hose, try to capture rainwater in buckets and use this to water your lawn in the summer.


In addition to this practice being environmentally friendly, lawns often prefer rainwater to tap water.

, If you have to water your lawn, then try to only do what is essential to keep it from turning brown and avoid running sprinklers too regularly. When watering it is preferable to give the lawn a good soak rather than a light sprinkle so turn the sprinklers on for a full night once a week, rather than misting your lawn every night.


Too little water encourages roots to grow at the surface. This makes the lawn less drought resistant.
Try to water your lawn during the cooler parts of the day, such as at dusk. This will allow the grass to soak up the water before the sun dries it up.

, While a brown lawn is less attractive, keep in mind that if your lawn does turn brown, it is very likely that it will return to its healthy green color when cooler and wetter seasons begin.


However, if you have just laid or reseeded your lawn, it may not become green again if it is allowed to turn brown. Make an effort to water these sorts of lawns during dry spells.

, At the end of summer, consider whether your lawn has any bare patches. If it does, you will have to decide if you want to reseed your lawn in the fall.


Reseeding helps to control lawn weeds because the thick, lush grass of the lawn can crowd the weeds out.

, In particular, look at the areas that are walked on relatively often. These areas are usually found near gates or doors, or where children play. Aerating your lawn helps gases circulate and promotes better grass health. There’s some evidence that it also revitalizes growth on an established lawn.


You can get special shoes with spikes on them to help aerate your lawn, or you can get a walk-behind tool with tines that poke holes in the soil.

Place the sprinkler head in a bucket.,
Apply a rust remover on the sprinkler head.,
Soak it for about 30 minutes.,
Scrub off any remaining buildup.",How to Clean Sprinkler Heads2," Disconnect the sprinkler head. Place it into a bucket or plastic bag. Your container should be large enough to fully submerge the sprinkler head.

, Cover the unit completely in a common household rust remover. These cleaners often will tackle calcium build up and other minerals that are common in water supplies., Soak the sprinkler head as directed by the instructions provided on the back of your favorite commercial rust remover cleaner.

, Use a hard, bristled brush to remove any buildup from the sprinkler head. Then, rinse it with clean water."
"
Lubricate any moving parts.,
Clear the area around the sprinkler head.,
Clean sprinkler heads regularly.",How to Clean Sprinkler Heads3," Grease all exposed moving parts after cleaning with any lubricant that does not create buildup, such as WD40., If the head is embedded in the ground, remove any grass or weeds that are too close to the unit. If the sprinkler is above ground, make sure it is on a level surface with no obstructions. Try placing a board underneath your sprinkler to give it more stability and prevent its components from directly coming into contact with dirt and future debris.

, Clean them at least twice a year. It is most important to do so before storing for the winter, in order to keep them working in ideal conditions. This will help prevent major clogging, and your lawn will thank you.If you still have poor water distribution, a clog may not be the only problem, check your water pressure and for any kinks in the hose as this will interfere with your sprinkler's ability to function properly.

Identify the presence of weeds.,
Apply a chemical weed killer in early summer.,
Choose an appropriate weed killer.,
Use a spray bottle to target individual weeds.,
Refrain from mowing the lawn before applying weed killer.,
Feed your lawn two weeks before applying the weed killer.,
Don’t apply weed killer when the soil is very dry.,
Refrain from feeding your lawn or applying weed killers too often.,
Try digging up the weeds as an alternative to using weed killer.",How to Care for Your Lawn in the Summer2," You’ll be able to spot lawn weeds if you notice flowers (especially dandelions) growing out of your lawn. You might also see the lawn has slightly inconsistent patches where the color or texture looks different than the rest of the lawn.


Both of these appearances suggest that weeds are growing.
Keep in mind that it is easier to spot weeds if the lawn hasn’t been mowed recently.

, If you decide to use a chemical weed killer, summer is the best time to apply it to your lawn as this is the main growing season for weeds.Try to avoid applying weedkiller right at the end of summer as weeds may be going dormant and it may be less effective.
You may need to apply weed killer once in early summer and once later in the summer.

, When you choose a branded weed killer, consider choosing a ‘weed and feed’ lawn treatment that both fights weeds and nourishes your lawn.


Alternately you can try targeting the individual weeds you spot. This targeted weed killer usually comes in a spray or gel form.

, Using a spray bottle can make applying weed killer more efficient. In particular, using a spray bottle works well when you are only spraying patches weeds on your lawn.


If the spray bottle nozzle is too wide, roll a piece of cardstock around the nozzle. The cardstock will create a funnel that will keep the spray from getting all over your lawn.

, If using a targeted weed killer, make the job easier for yourself by applying it when the lawn hasn’t been mowed in a while. Doing this will help you to spot the problem areas, as weeds are easier to see when the lawn has been allowed to grow out a bit.


At the same time, try to avoid mowing right after you have spread your weedkiller. Wait a day or two to allow the weed killer to spread through the entire weed.

, Before applying your weed killer, you can consider feeding your lawn and then holding off on moving for two weeks. The lawn fertilizer will help the weeds to grow, which in turn will make it easier for you to spot them and kill them.

, Try to apply a weed killing chemical when the soil isn’t too dry. Consider applying the weedkiller a few days after a rainfall.


Likewise, try to avoid spraying weed killer on your lawn if it is supposed to rain that day or the following day.

, Two applications of feed or weed killing chemical per year should suffice.


Try to avoid feeding your lawn or using weed killer during the first year after you have laid your new lawn.

, If you prefer to avoid using chemicals then you can try digging weeds. To do this, you can use a variety of tools, including a hori hori blade or a weed puller.

Learn the amount of acreage (or hectares) in the land that is to be seeded.,
Check the grass seed rate on the bag or with the grass seed manufacturer.,
Since one acre = 43,560 square feet, first begin dividing 1000 square feet by 43,560 to get 43.56.,
Calculate the seeding rate by multiplying the number of acres (or hectares) by the pounds (kilograms) of grass seed per acre (hectare).,
Know that the purpose of the seeding is also important in determining grass seed calculations.,
Understand the differences between cool season and warm season grasses.,
Consider attributes of the land and the species selected in order to fine-tune grass seed calculations.",How to Calculate Grass Seed Per Acre,"


Total acreage (or hectares) is listed in land survey details and is available from the county office or in your municipality's land records department.
You can also measure the land yourself or hire a surveyor to provide this information to aid in calculating amount grass seed needed.;
,


For example, Kentucky bluegrass is often recommended at 1.5 to 2 lb (0.680 or 0.907 kg) per 1,000 square feet (92.9 square meters); turf-type tall fescue is 6 to 8 lb (2.7 kg to 3.6 kg) per 1000 square meters.
Most grass seed label mixes recommend 4 to 5 lb (1.8 to 2.2 kg) of grass seed for each 1,000 square feet (92.9 square meters) of land.

, Then multiply 43.56 by the pounds of grass seed for each 1,000 square feet to get the amount of grass seed needed per acre.


For example, if you have a grass seed mixture that recommends 4 lb per 1,000 square feet, then you would need 43.56 x 4 = 174.24 lb of grass seed per acre.
Working in metric, consider that 1000 square feet = 92.90 square meters, and 1 hectare = 2.47 acres. So if the label tells you 4 lb of grass seed for 1000 square feet, that equates to 1.81 kg per 92.90 square meters. If you need to calculate amount of grass seed needed per hectare, then you will need to calculate it out via a longer method:

1.81 kg ÷ 92.90 square meters = 0.0195 kg/square meters; since 1 hectare = 10,000 square meters, 0.0195 x 10,000 = 195 kg of seed is needed per hectare.

For example, if you had 2 acres (0.81 ha) of land, from the above grass seed calculation, you would multiply 174.24 lb/acre by 2 acres to get 348.48 lb. If you had 50 acres, then 174.24 x 50 = 8,712 lb of grass seed.

Going by imperial, about 174 lb/acre = 195 kg/ha; so, since 2 acres = 0.81 hectares, then 195 kg/ha x 0.8 = 157.95 kg; if you had 50 acres = 20.23 ha, then you would need 195 kg/ha x 20.23 ha = 3,944.85 kg of grass seed.


Round up to the next pound, i.e. 348.48 lb (157.95 kg) would be 349 lb (158 kg).

, Turf grass for a golf course or football field needs to be denser that the median between lanes of traffic or a slope.


Erosion control and landscaping are two different purposes that affect the seeding rate.

Basically, less seed is needed for erosion control than for landscaping.


For forage production or wild-land meadows, you only need 10 to 20 lb of of grass seed per acre. Some intensive forage production requires more, such as 30 to 40 lb of seed per acre, especially when growing hay for export markets or to sell for making feed pellets or cubes.

,


Cool-season (C3) grasses are better adapted to cooler climates with harsh winters. Kentucky Bluegrass, Creeping Red Fescue and Tall Fescue are cool-season grasses adapted to cool climates, and are highly recommended for lawns in such areas. Perennial ryegrass is also a cool-season grass, however in climates where winters are too severe for long-term survival, it would not fare well as a lawn grass.
Warm-season (C4) grasses are adapted to southern climates with a mild year-round climate. Bermuda-grass, Centipede-grass, and Zoysia-grass are warm-season grasses adapted to southern climates, like in the southern USA. They are also drought-tolerant, and withstand cooler temperatures better than other warm-season grasses.

,


Soil type, slope, soil fertility, climate (with regards to location) should be known in order to plan out what seed is needed for your lawn. Shady locations and moisture of the soil will also affect seeding rate.
Pure live seed rate (PLS), number of seeds per pound, and adaptability of the species selected will influence success rate of grass seed. As mentioned just above, fertility is also needed to determine if fertilizer is needed in addition to the seed put down.

PLS is needed to be known to fine-tune how much seed you will need to sow. The higher the rate (meaning, the more live seed there is) the more accurate you will be for the amount of seed that needs to be sown. But if PLS, based on a percentage, is lower, you will need more seed for a better success rate.
In regards to number of seeds per pound (kilogram), the more seeds there are per pound or kilogram, the less seed needed for sowing lawn or pasture.

Know when to do it.,
Get a garden fork and start poking your lawn.,
Make sure the ground is wet.,
Starting in one corner, make your way across pushing the fork down into the garden every six inches (150mm) Then move backwards and forwards across your garden until the task has been completed.

,
Learn about alternatives.,
Both of the methods described above are a good way of doing small gardens.",How to Aerate a Small Lawn," This task just needs to be completed twice a year and it is best done in early Spring and early Autumn.;
, All you need is a simple garden fork and with that you are going to make a set of holes by pushing down through the lawn and into the soil below.

, This is best done after a shower of rain as this makes the ground much softer and easier to push through.

,, Some people prefer to purchase and use what are called garden aerator shoes. These are simply shoes with a set of spikes that attach to your own shoes and you simply walk backwards and forwards across your garden until the task is completed. This is a much faster way of doing the aeration.

, However when you have a larger garden this would be very time consuming. In these cases there are different machines available that will help make the task much easier to do.

"
Decide whether you will be sharing your living area with others.,
You should begin looking for places months before you actually move.,
When looking at a place, keep in mind that you're probably not going to get a palace.,
Make an inventory of the state of the house together with the landlord.,
Draw up a budget plan.,
Move in.,
Discuss your old room with your parents - you may want to overhaul your old stuff, getting rid of junk, taking your favorite and most used stuff to your new place.,
Set up utility (bills) accounts for water, gas and electricity.,
Last and not least, make sure you can afford to pay all your bills once you move, that your employment is secure, and that you will have enough money to live comfortably and not struggle to pay rent, utilities, food, gas for your car, and insurance.",How to Move Out of Home Into Your First Apartment," Having roommates is good because if you choose them right they will split the cost of living with you, help around the house, and provide useful items for moving. Be warned: doing so is also risky. The person could stop paying their share of rent, whether by choice or because of financial instability. They could also not assist in purchasing necessities, such as groceries. They could also not help around the house. You should choose a very close friend if at all possible, someone who you know would have similar living habits.;
, Make appointments to view the places. Before your appointment, drive around to see what the area is like. Look for places you're going to need to go. Try to choose a place central to all these locations. Do not pick a place to live because it's convenient to your ""friends"" and their needs; this will be your home and must have everything you will need for a long time to come. Many teens move out and find a place because their ""friends"" like it and think it's cool, but your ""friends"" now may not be your ""friends"" when you pay your first month's rent for the place they liked.

, Compare the rate to the quality of the place and also to other rates. Do you want a cheaper place or would you rather pay more for a nicer place? If at all possible, bring a friend and a parent; both will provide you with different views of the place to help in your decision.

, Draft a letting contract (or buy one at a stationer's); read through, making sure it covers things like deposit (typically a month's rent)and responsibility for bills; and sign it. (The landlord will likely already have a contract established.)

, Take into account costs such as utilities, insurance, groceries, clothing, and the occasional night out or movie rental. Will your wage/salary support this? If you are living with other people, figure out the total income per month and discuss how costs will be divided.

, Parents are excellent sources of unwanted (for them) linens, crockery, pots and pans, bookshelves etc. Also try looking in thrift stores. Although these places may not appeal to some, you can purchase some cheaper stuff for the time being and replace it later. Try to buy as much as possible before you move in; that way you are not stuck without it.

, Anything that you don't need could be used by a roommate, so ask. Also, you could try selling the stuff you don't want online or at a garage sale to make some extra money. It isn't nice to leave all your old junk with your parents, so if you're not going to use or sell it, unless they are OK with you leaving it behind, do them a favor and take it to the junkyard.

, You can often pick up the previous tenants' accounts in a new name - ask the landlord. (Again this has likely already been done.) Deposits are generally required to set up the account.

, Living paycheck to paycheck is neither easy nor fun. Your monthly salary should be at least $1000.00 OR more than all your bills combined so you can be secure financially. Your parents may have made it look easy to provide for you...but it isn't. 65% of kids that move out end up back home or homeless in 3 months or less. Make sure you are ready to make the move in case your parents don't let you move back in. Do not leave your home on a bad note if at all possible; talk to your parents and work out any problems before you leave.

Tables, chairs, and bedroom furniture would be considered important furniture
Small shelves or desks that could easily be replaced can be left behind.;
, When you make a big move you have to be picky about what you bring with you because the more things you take, the more expensive the move will be. Go through your home to make a pile of things you can part with so you only move with the essentials.Anything small that you can purchase new after you move should be donated or sold.
Old clothes, shoes, and linens should be purged before the move.
Getting rid of any furniture that you aren’t attached to will help make less cargo space to move.

, Your friends can help you sort your items. Let your friends pick a favorite item to keep when you move. Having extra hands help you pack boxes will also help the process go faster.

, You shouldn’t pack any corrosive, flammable, explosive, or otherwise hazardous materials. These can be dangerous to move, and many moving companies won’t allow these items to be packed.Cleaners, such as house cleaners, should be used up or given away before moving.
Wall paint and paint thinners should be disposed of and not packed.
Gasoline and propane tanks should also not be packed to move.

, You will need to know how big of a truck or container you need when you start researching moving methods. Estimate the amount of space you’ll need by measuring your big pieces of furniture, and then estimating the amount of boxes you will have and the space they will take up. Typical moving trucks are about 8 feet tall, stacking boxes strategically will save you space.


It’s best to overestimate rather than underestimate so you end up having enough room for all of your things.
Calculate the volume of your boxes by multiplying the Length X Width X Height for each box and then multiply by the number of boxes you will be packing.
Moving trucks and storage units provide dimensions in Cubic Feet. Knowing the approximate volume of space your items will take up will let you know how large of a moving container you will need.

, There are many different ways to move your things in a long distance move. Research different companies and methods to find which fits your budget and is right for you.Hire a moving company to load your things on a truck and drive it to your new home. Movers will then unload your things into your new home.
Rent a storage container. Many companies will drop a storage container at your home a few days before the move for you to pack your belongings into. They will come pick it up and put it on a truck to ship to your new home when you are ready to move. Once there, they’ll drop it at your new home for you to unload yourself.
Rent a moving truck. Some companies let you rent a moving truck to pack and drive yourself. This can sometimes be the most cost efficient method, although you will have to consider the cost of gas.Typically there are several different sizes of trucks to choose from as well as an option to tow your car behind the truck.
In order to move your belongings quickly across country, air cargo may be an option. Contact freight carriers to obtain quotes for air cargo.

, Most moving companies will have an option to purchase insurance for your move. It’s a good idea to get the insurance so that your things arrive safely and you aren’t liable for anything that might go wrong.

, Once you decide which method you want to use for moving, ask the company for a quote on your move. They will give you a detailed breakdown of the cost.Make sure the quote includes any insurance cost or taxes so you understand the full amount of the move.
Ask about extra delivery fees or if assistance loading and unloading is included.

, If you are driving to your new home, you need to calculate the cost of gas to make the drive. If you’re flying to your new destination, find out what the average cost of a one way plane ticket for each member of your family will be for your flight.


Determine the number of miles you’ll be driving.
Divide the number of miles by the average miles per gallon your car gets.
Multiply by the national price average for a gallon of gasoline.

, If you’re moving somewhere that you can’t drive to in one day, you’ll need to include money for your hotels. You also need to budget for your meals while you’re on the trip, including snacks.Choosing hotels with free breakfast can be a budget friendly deal to help you save on food.

, You will need boxes, packing papers, packing cushion, and packing tape to get all of your things ready to move.Purchase boxes from local shipping or hardware stores, including boxes made for specific items like plates or glasses.
Ask retail stores for free, discarded boxes from shipments they receive.
Purchase packing paper, or you can use recycled newspaper from friends and family.
A trick for free packing cushion is to use your hand towels to wrap things like plates or glasses as a cushion.

, It’s best to pack heavy items such as books in smaller boxes so they are easier to pick up and move. Save big boxes for light weight things like pillows, linens, and clothing., Keep items from the same room in the same box. Avoid putting items from different rooms in the same box to help you label things more accurately. This will make unpacking easier when you get to your new home.

, Make sure you clearly label all of your boxes so you know where to put them when you unpack. It’s helpful to label the boxes on three sides so no matter how you load the boxes you’ll be able to read the label.


It’s a good idea to label the boxes with the contents of the box as well as the room they go in.

, You might arrive to your new home before your belongings do, so it’s important to keep your everyday items like toiletries with you as you travel.


You should bring a week’s worth of clothes,shoes, and accessories with you.
Toiletries and medications should be packed with you on your trip.
Jewelry or irreplaceable keepsakes should travel with you to ensure they don’t get damaged or lost.

, Moving to a new city requires you to secure new housing. Look for long term hotels that can provide weekly rates if you are not sure where you are planning to stay in your new state.

Many rentals require a walkthrough before signing a lease. It can be difficult to obtain a lease for a new apartment when are still living in another state.

, Moving to a new state means moving to a new economy. Check government economic data to determine how the cost of groceries, insurance, or housing vary from state to state.

, Make sure that you contact your bank before you move to let them know you will be traveling. Making purchases across several states in the course of a day can raise red flags at banks.


Tell your bank your moving plans to avoid fraud alerts.

You should also update any magazine subscriptions, membership clubs, or other bills with your new address., Your car insurance is tied to the state you are in, so when you move to a new state, it’s important to change your insurance. If you have a nation wide insurance company, you can call to let them know you have moved, and they will start your insurance policy in the new state. You can also change insurance companies and start a new policy.

, When you move to a new state, you need to change your driver’s license and car tag to the new state. Most states require you to already have your car insurance changed before getting a license plate. Check the local dmv to find out what costs will be associated with getting a new license and license plate.Make sure you find out how long you have before you have to get these things changed. Some states give you 90 days to get it changed, but others only give you 30 days.

, It’s important to register to vote when you move so you don’t forget about it, and aren’t unregistered when an election comes around. Some states have you can do this when you get your new driver’s license."

Trying to pack your entire household in a day or two isn’t advisable and sure to cause much undue stress., If you have a plan for moving, it will not only make the process go more quickly, but it will help you remain calm.


Setting goals for each day is a good idea. For example, you could pack the living room on Monday, the bathroom on Tuesday, and the bedroom on Wednesday.Having other organizational structures will support your plan. For example, designate white trash bags for items you’re taking on the move, and black trash bags for trash. This will keep you from throwing away what you need or digging to figure out what you’ve packed in these bags., Having an assortment of moving supplies on hand, from different sized boxes to packing tape, will keep you from having to make unnecessary trips to the store for materials.Essential supplies for moving are: a variety of small, medium and large packing boxes; packing tape; permanent markers for identifying box contents; box labels or colored tape for coding the contents of your boxes; packing material such as bubble wrap or newspaper; and furniture pads.Sandwich bags are an excellent option for packing small parts.Plastic wrap such as Glad Press n’ Seal will allow you to seal clothing in drawers so that you don’t have to pack them in a separate box.Renting a dolly from a moving company such as UHaul will help you move large furniture and stacks of multiple boxes quickly., Companies such as PODS offer transportable storage units. The company will drop off the pod, pick it up when you’re ready, and then deliver it to your new home.This method allows you to move boxes as you pack them and give you access for more than a day, which is a disadvantage of a moving van or truck., Getting rid of anything you don’t want or need in your new home will also help you move more quickly.Goodwill or other charities such as the Salvation Army will pick up any items you would like to donate., Choose one specific place to pack your belongings to make the process run smoothly.Have all of your packing supplies in that place. Assembling boxes before you start will help you pack faster., Take pictures of the different cord and wire connections on electronics such as televisions, DVD players, and internet routers. This will save you time because you won’t have to guess the right configuration when you unpack., Having extra sets of hands to help you pack and move your boxes will significantly decrease your move time.Assigning your friends and family specific tasks will further expedite your moving process.

, Pack items you will need before you unpack in your new home in order to keep yourself from having to search through boxes. You’ll want to pack some clothing, a couple of towels, your toiletries, and anything else you think you might need., If you pack your home one room at a time, it will keep the process manageable and organize, decreasing the likelihood that you’ll have to scramble finding your items.If you can, put together small items in things like baskets and cover them with Glad Press n’ Seal. Then you can easily place them in a moving box without damaging the items or packing everything individually.An effective and fast way to pack clothes is simply leaving them on the hangers and either placing them flat in the back of your vehicle, collecting them in a garbage bag with the hangers sticking out, or putting them in a wardrobe box., As you pack each room, make sure to keep like items together. For example, pack first aid and medical supplies together., If you have a system of labeling your boxes, it will make packing similar items together easier and help you find items more quickly when you unpack.One way to label is by writing to what room the box belongs to on the outside.Putting different colored pieces of tape is another great way to label your boxes. Each room will get a different color, which will make it easier for you to place them in the correct spaces in your new home., Once you’ve packed your boxes, it’s time to move them into the form of transportation that will take them to your new home.


If you decide on transportable storage, you can move the boxes when you like. You can move the boxes room by room this way, making it easier to unpack at your new home.
If you decide on a moving truck or van, you’ll likely only have one day to move your boxes. You can also do this room by room to keep the process organized.

, Taking a few pictures of your empty space will ensure that you get your security deposit back if you’re a renter and help you avoid quibbles with new buyers if you’re the home owner., If you don’t want to use the option of a transportable storage or your personal vehicle, consider hiring a moving company or moving van just for transportation.

Decide on what moving services you want to use.,
Research and hire a moving company.,
Talk to the movers and ask questions.,
Meet the movers at your new home.",How to Move out Quickly2," Before you find the right moving company to help you relocate quickly, it’s a good idea to find out what services different companies offer. From this information, you can figure out if you want to let them pack and unpack your entire home, or if you want to take on all or some of the packing yourself.


Moving companies like Mayflower and Bekins offer a broad range of moving services. These include: completely packing and unpacking your home, packing and unpacking some of your home, or simply moving your already packed home.Allowing a moving company to pack and unpack your entire home is the fastest method to move, but will also cost the most.

, After you’ve decided on what moving services you would like, you’re ready to research and hire the right company for your needs.


Compare different companies, their services, and prices online. Mayflower, Bekins, and Atlas Van Services all have websites that allow you to compare their prices and services, and make a reservation for your move.
Read the fine print of any offer. This will not only inform you of their rules, but also spare you from any extra or hidden charges.When you make your reservation, print a copy of your reservation confirmation. The day before your scheduled move, reconfirm the reservation with the company.

, On your moving day, talk to the movers about their plans for your move and any wishes or expectations you may have, and confirm any delivery information. Also ask them any questions you have.


If you opted to have the movers pack and unpack your entire home, confirm this information with them and let them know if there’s a specific way you’d like them to pack your items.
If you opted to have the movers pack and unpack some of your home, discuss the division of labor with them. From this step, you will apply the same tips to your select items that you would for packing your entire home by yourself.
If you opted to pack your entire apartment before the moving company picks it up for delivery to your new home, you will apply the same tips for packing your entire apartment quickly and efficiently by yourself.

, On the day you’ve decided to move into your new home, meet the movers at the time you selected. You will need to let them in to your new home so they can place your boxes in the proper rooms.

Keep an address book of the kids' friends.,
Involve your children in the packing.,
Allow room for tears.,
Embrace the moving process.",How to Move With Kids," As soon as you have a confirmation of your relocation (place and time), tell your children about it. This will give everyone plenty of time to absorb the idea, process it and make plans for the transition.;
, Before talking to them, take a look of what your new location has to offer to children, which would attract your kids’ attention. One idea would be to put a “tourist” package together with all the parks, museums, hiking spots and nature related activities.

, If your child, for example, is a boy scout, make sure you contact their chapter in your new town, introduce yourself and get their information. The same goes for swim teams, chess clubs, art classes or any other area of interest of your children.

, Since the school is the most important place of social activity for children, make sure you research your new area through a reliable website. Make sure to contact the schools ahead and plan a tour.

, For many families, moving equals “downsizing” and that means siblings may have to share rooms, or that the children will have to part from their belongings. Again, be upfront about it and plan a day when you’ll help them do the sorting of their toys, clothes and books. Arrange to go with them to your family favorite charity and this way they can feel better, knowing someone in need will make good use of what they’re sharing.

, When you learn you’ll be moving, contact your children’s teachers, coaches and caregivers. Making sure they know about your move will help create a net of supporting people for you and the children. Ask them if it’s possible to organize a farewell party, which can be as simple as juices and home-made cupcakes for your children’s classmates. Take pictures and allow your children to make an album as a keepsake.

, Even young ones will enjoy feeling connected by knowing their friends addresses and emails, of course! It may come down that they’ll never send their friends a holiday card, but you’ll empower them in the transition.

, Allow your little ones to help you pack their belongings and to pack a backpack with their favorite items to take with them on the trip. Also, remind them to include games, books and some coloring supplies for the trip. Whether you’re driving or flying, you’ll need them!

, It’s a given that they will come, so just accept them and give room for everyone to grieve the separation. It’s part of the change.

, Keep your cool, trust your heart and always move forward! Kids pick up on our anxieties so, make an effort to embrace the change and they will follow. Now, give your best and just go for it with all your heart.

If digging up and transplanting plants from your garden, plan well ahead.,
Remove pests and weeds.,
Put the plants into suitable containers the day before moving.,
Clearly mark the boxes so that the movers know what they're dealing with.,

Unpack plants as soon as they arrive.",How to Move Plants," Think realistically about space, weight, and suitability of the new house and/or climate for your existing plants. If you're moving interstate, check local quarantine regulations on plant movement and if moving overseas, it's likely that you cannot move plants, or that to do so will be extremely costly.;
, Clean them up several weeks prior to the move so that they're not stressed by carrying disease, dead leaves and branches, etc. Prune, deadhead, and generally tidy up the plants.


The less foliage on a plant, the less effort the plant has to put into protecting itself as a whole.

, It's a good idea to get professional advice if possible.


Dig up well ahead of time, months if possible.
Wrap the root ball in hessian cloth.
Place the plant in a cool, shaded area of the garden.
Keep the root ball moist (not wet) at all times.
Move with care; try not to move it more than necessary from the time it's dug out of the ground to the moment it is loaded on the moving truck.

, Check the plants for pests and weeds one week prior to the moving. Eliminate them. You don't want to carry them with you and if the new place doesn't have an infestation of the same pests, here is a chance to break the cycle for your plants.


A quick fix for both plant and soil is to place the entire plant and container into an opaque plastic bag with a flea collar or pest strip. Leave overnight and remove the plastic bag the next morning.

, Cardboard boxes are the best choice for most plants as they're sturdy and breathe. Use dampened newspaper or packing paper to hold the plants in place within the boxes.


Protect the leaves using paper. Float a thin, damp layer of paper over the top of each plant to act as a protective layer.

, Write ""PLANTS. HANDLE WITH CARE."" in large letters.

, Give the plants a quick spray spritz and close the lids. Punch breathing holes into various parts of the boxes.

, Along with pets, plants should be your top priority for settling in quickly.


Take plants out from the base of the box. This will ensure that you handle the heaviest end of the plant and avoid damaging the stem.
Keep the plants in darker lit areas initially and gradually return them to brighter light, to give them a chance to adjust to the brighter light/sunshine again.

Choose an island.,
Solicit advice from local residents.,
Make a short visit beforehand.,
Contract with a shipping company to move your belongings.,
Arrange to ship your vehicle.,
Gather all of your identity documents.",How to Move to the US Virgin Islands1," You have four options if you’d like to move to the USVI: St. Thomas, St. John, St. Croix, and Water Island. St. Thomas and St. Croix are the largest and the most modernized, but they can be rather crowded with tourists. St. John is slightly smaller with some shopping available, but you will likely need to travel to the other islands for certain goods. And, on Water Island, you will get the benefits of isolation, but will need to head to St. Thomas for all of your supplies.Go online to forums discussing each island and ask as many questions as you can of the residents currently living there. This will give you a better sense of the differences and similarities between them.;
, If you have a friend or family member who currently lives on the islands, get in touch with them. Tell them about your plans and ask for their help and advice. Describe the kind of lifestyle that you envision for yourself and tell them to be honest with you about whether or not you can find that in the USVI.


If you don’t have a contact in the USVI, visit online blogs from current residents, including people who’ve relocated, to see what they would advise for both moving and settling in. They can give you an idea regarding local customs, such as proper travel etiquette for the safari bus.To connect with locals, browse through USVI moving forums online. These sites are designed around a question-and-answer format with local “experts” volunteering to guide new arrivals through the moving and residency process., If you’ve never visited the islands before, try to schedule a quick trip well in advance of your move date. This will allow you to see first-hand the neighborhood you’ll be living in. In fact, you may even take this chance to meet with a real estate lawyer or leasing agent., Months before you plan to move, reach out to a maritime shipping agency. Some of these companies are listed on the USVI Moving website. The company will likely schedule an in-home survey of your items to see how much room they will require to ship. After that, they will give you an estimate based on the cubic footage needed.Some companies will even offer to leave a shipping container at your home, giving you plenty of time to pack. Just make sure that the container will be delivered right to your new address or you may end up lugging items up an island hill as part of your move., Most islanders would recommend that you bring a car with you. Cars older than 2.5 years of age can avoid some of the required customs duties. If you want to avoid the hassle of customs check-in and licensing, there are companies on the island that will actually do that for you. Find them by contacting your island’s commerce office.It is also cheaper to bring in a car that is both made AND assembled within the United States, as this lowers the customs fees. Find out if your car qualifies by checking the information on the driver’s side door panel.
Some people ship two cars over as part of the moving process. They keep one car for their personal use and sell the other one to cover the total shipping cost. You’ll often get a deal for shipping two at once. It shouldn’t take you too long to sell the vehicles either. In particular, Islanders are often eager to buy solid, older model small trucks., If you are a U.S. citizen, then you’ll want to bring your social security card, current driver’s license, birth certificate, and non-expired passport. If you are not an American citizen, then you’ll need to obtain a visa for work and residency. When you make the move, bring any and all official forms of documentation that you possess with you.The USVI fall under United States immigration requirements. The website for the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services is a great resource for information about paperwork requirements.

Choose an energy efficient dryer if you must use one.,
Get an energy-efficient machine.,
Look into natural washing solutions for stains.,
Look for iron-free solutions.",How to Save Energy in the Laundry," When washing your clothes, the cold water cycle is the best option in most cases. Get a detergent capable of handling cold washes; most eco-friendly detergents are designed this way.;
, Only wash when there are enough clothes to fill your washing machine. This makes the most of each load.

, Either washed lightly soiled items using the ""quick"" cycle on low water, or try your hand at washing them in the tub with a few quick scrubs of your own.


Where possible, cut the wash cycle down to less than 10 minutes for each load







, That way, no pre-soaking is necessary.


Use laundry softener in the wash unless you like the feel of rough towels to dry with. Some people do, so choose what feels best.







, Yes, this is personal, and yes, you should change your underwear every day like mom said. Still, if you try (and teach your family to do the same), you can cut down on the amount of laundry you produce.


Avoid changing clothes multiple times per day.
Wear outer clothing, like pants, skirts, and jackets, more than once before washing it, if you don't spill anything on it. As a bonus, they'll last longer too.
Wear the same pajamas for a few nights in a row before washing.
Hang towels to dry after each use and you can use them for multiple showers. Get each family member a different color or a different hook, if you need to.

, Where possible, avoid using the dryer and hang your clothes out to dry. A powered clothes dryer is one of the least energy-efficient appliances in any household, whereas a clothesline or clothes rack is naturally solar powered. Line drying ensures really clean and beautiful smelling clothes and linens. It also is a great way to end a cold wash, as the sun bleaches any germs right out of the fabrics.

Did you know you can put sheets on the bed while they're still wet? It sounds a bit strange, but cotton sheets are thin fabric, and they will dry very quickly if left uncovered.






While people often used clothespins to hang on a line, you can save time and energy and dry more clothes if you put them on hangers, then place them on the line and hold them in place with a clothespin to anchor the hanger to the line






If you are hanging clothes outside, hang the heavy items at the ends of the line and smaller, shorter items in the middle







, A folding indoor clothes rack is enough for a load of socks and underwear. It's indoors, so won't get you in trouble with the apartment complex or homeowners' association, and it will dry laundry even if it's raining outside.


Dry your clothes on clothing rods in doorways.






Air dry socks and underwear even if you don't like to air dry the rest. It's easier on the elastic, and it doesn't matter if your underwear is wrinkled.






When hang drying towels, fold them in half and pin to hangers.







, Hang heavy items with hoods or long sleeves upside down using clothes pins to dry them faster.

, This will keep the area warmer and the items will dry faster.

, They'll dry well and this is a great way to keep the mates together.

, However, they must be checked, and when dry to touch on outside folds, then turn them wrong side out and dry the other layers.

, For dry climates, indoor drying is a great way to increase humidity in the wintertime in your house.

, You do not want to hang them too closely together or they might not dry as well.

, If you like putting clothes through the dryer because this gets rid of wrinkles and softens fabric, put them in for just a few minutes and take them out damp and hang them up for the rest of the drying. You'll get the same effect and save energy.

, Front-loaders have had a lot of good press in recent years about their efficiency but they can have two drawbacks - they are pricey and when they break, they can be harder to fix. For some people, bending down to reach in is also a problem. If you can afford a good quality one and you can place it somewhere accessible, they make a great energy-efficient choice. If not, look for quality top loaders with good energy ratings. The later models are competing well with their energy-efficient front-loader cousins and may well be just as good.

, Rather than using harsh chemicals that can harm you and the environment, look in wikiHow's clothing stain removal suggestions for many great natural product suggestions for washing out problems without creating any more.

, To lessen the ironing, fold clothes directly out of a dryer and they will not wrinkle. Fold clothes directly from the clothesline and pack away immediately. Look for wrinkle-free clothing options, provided they are eco-friendly. And don't bother ironing weekend wear, if you're wearing it around the house and garden.

Evaluate your driving habits.,
Work remotely or telecommute when you can.,
Plan meals to limit your trips to the grocery store.,
Organize your outings into one trip.,
Explore downsizing if you have more than one car.,
Consider moving to an area that makes it easier not to drive.",How to Reduce Your Dependence on a Car1," Think about your typical week, and see if there are places you drive to frequently that you could reach without using your car. Make a list of the places that are within 5 miles (8.0 km) of your home and decide what other modes of transportation you could utilize to reach those spots.;
, More and more companies are hiring workers who complete their assignments from home. While this won’t be an option for every job or every day, discuss the possibility of limiting your travel to the office with your boss. This conversation could cut down on your commuting.Prepare a proposal for your boss that lists benefits of your remote work to your company. For example, you could mention that you’ll be able to start work earlier in the day, since you won’t need to commute. You could also say that you’ll be able to increase your productivity, since you’ll be happier and less worried about your environmental impact.

, If you start the week without an idea of what you’re having for dinner each night, you may end up at the grocery store four or five times per week. To avoid this back-and-forth, make a list of your weekly grocery needs and plan your meals ahead of time. Not only will this simplify your life during the week, but it’ll also reduce your driving time!, Every time you drive to and from your house, you’re adding driving time. Try to plan out your daily and weekly schedule so that you’re aggregating your driving needs into as few trips as possible.For example, combine grocery shopping with picking your daughter up from ballet class at night. Or, make grocery shopping a family activity that follows your Sunday-morning pancake outing.

, This may not be an option for all families. Think about each family member’s daily and weekly needs, and consider whether one car could cover the trips. Try dropping each other off at various destinations and taking turns using alternative modes of transportation.

, There are many cities and towns that have great options for public transportation, as well as town centers with shopping and activities that can be easily reached on foot or by bike. See if you and your family can make a move to one of these areas.It’ll be easier to abandon your car in a city than a town. In the United States, New York City, Boston, and San Francisco, for example, all have excellent public transit systems. They also have relatively high costs of living, so you’ll have to weigh the pros and cons of moving to these places.

Dress warm and have extra clothes in the car.,
Clean the driveway and porch of snow or ice.,
Prepare something warm to drink for the movers.,
Have healthy snacks available to family members.,
Check your vehicle and prepare an emergency kit before the move.,
Be prepared.",How to Move in the Winter," Since families engage in the moving experience, it is critical that all family members are dressed warm whether they are assisting with the move from inside or outside the house. You wouldn’t want a child or yourself to catch a cold at this significant point in one’s life; not only would you have to make sure everything is running smoothly at the time of the move but would also have to take care of helpless individual. Not to mention you would lose manpower and extra help. Therefore, make sure that you bring warm clothes for everyone and keep them in the family vehicle, that way everyone can have easy access to the extra scarf or sweater that they need. You may also want to change out of your moving clothes once you arrive at your new home without having to search through endless wardrobe boxes for your clothes, hence you should pack a bag of extra clothes that you can put in your car. Make sure that your new home has operational heating; you wouldn’t want to waste time fixing the furnace instead of focusing on moving.;
, Whether it is slush, hail, ice, or snow, any winter barrier will always delay the pickup, loading, and delivery for any individual. This is why, before your moving crew arrives at your current home, you should shovel all walkways and driveways for easy access. You can also cover all walkways with salt to ensure that nobody will slip and fall while carrying your belongings; you wouldn’t want any accidents that could become your liability on this already stressful day. Also, if there is plenty of snow on the road in front of your home, you may want to consider shoveling the snow there as well just so that the moving truck can conveniently access your driveway. Keep some salt and shovels in your car because you may have to use these materials at your new home as well. Cover your floors and carpets to avoid any mess or stains caused by people bringing in snow on their shoes.

, During the loading process, it is a nice gesture to offer a warm beverage to your moving crew that is working in the cold weather. This would probably result in even better service as well. You could prepare some hot tea, hot chocolate, or even offer warm milk to the moving professionals. The crew would probably consist of only 2 or 3 members; therefore you won’t spend a lot of money by performing this appreciative gesture.

, Usually moves takes about 4-9 hours, depending on the size of the house and how furnished each room is. Since everyone will be working to speed up the process, they would definitely work faster and diligently if your family will have access to healthy snacks or prepared meals. Considering your refrigerator will be empty at this time, you should think ahead and prepare a list of the foods not to pack. For example, you can have fruits like apples and pears available on the counter or you can make tuna sandwiches and keep them in a small cooler in the kitchen. If this is not your concern, you can always order pizza from a local pizza shop to keep everyone full and satisfied.

, Once all of your belongings are loaded onto the moving truck and you are ready to drive to your new home, make sure your vehicle is fully serviced and maintained to avoid any mishaps on the difficult roads. Always keep a spare tire, first aid kit, bottled water, maps, and a flashlight in your car; you should always be prepared for any emergency. Use local radio stations to keep informed of any road conditions.

, The most important factor when relocating is to always plan ahead. Deal with the minor details ahead of time so you can focus on the enjoyment of the transition to your new home, regardless of the weather.

Obtain used cooking oil.,
Examine the oil.,
Pour your oil into clear plastic containers.,
Heat the oil to 95ºF.,
Use cheesecloth or a coffee filter to pour oil through.,
Reheat the oil to 140ºF.,
Pour the reheated oil into a container to settle.,
Transfer the oil to a clean container.,
Dissolve lye into distilled water.,
Add oil to isopropyl alcohol.,
Add phenolphthalein solution.,
Add 0.1% lye solution to your oil and alcohol mixture.,
Ready your main quantity of oil.",How to Prepare Used Cooking Oil for Biodiesel," Locate a source for vegetable oil that has been used in cooking. Contact local fast food restaurants, cafeterias, hotels and other commercial food establishments to see if you can take their waste oil, or pay a very small fee for it. You may compete with rendering companies, who also pay restaurants to take used oil off their hands.Try a restaurant that sells a lot of fried food, like French fries or fried chicken, as they are very likely to have large quantities of used oil that they need to dispose of.
Ask restaurants if they use canola or olive oil, as these are typically the best oils for creating biodiesel. Avoid hydrogenated oils, which are generally higher in Free Fatty Acids and cause problems in biodiesel production.You can buy new cooking oil from the grocery store, but using waste oil is less expensive and helps reduce waste that would otherwise end up in a landfill or in sewer pipes.;
, Look at the oil you obtain to roughly determine its quality. It should look darker than fresh or unused vegetable oil, and will likely include small food matter left from the frying process.


If the oil appears milky or cloudy, do not use it, as it is likely too high in water content and/or animal fats, which will interfere in the biodiesel production process.
Make sure to follow the proper procedures to dispose of cooking oil that you do not use. Contact your local waste management company or ask the restaurant you obtained the oil from to find out how they safely dispose of the oil.

, Take any transparent plastic jug from juice, soda, or any other household product and pour your used oil into it for storage.


Ensure that any storage jug is completely clean, dry, and free of any other residue or materials, including water. Use a container with a tight lid and no cracks or leaks.
The oil may already have come to you in an acceptable container when you obtained it from a restaurant or other source. However, you will need several clean containers (at least 3) on hand for storing oil at each stage of the filtration process.
Label oil containers, and all other materials used in biodiesel production, clearly. At this stage, you can label the oil as “used oil” or “unfiltered oil” in order to avoid confusion in later steps of the process.

, Pour your used oil into a large, clean cooking pot and heat it to 95ºF over an electric burner to make the oil easier to pour for filtration. Use a cooking thermometer to monitor the temperature. Don’t use a gas burner for this or any other stage of the biodiesel creation process.It’s best to complete this process outdoors or in a very well-ventilated area. Wear long rubber gloves, an apron, and safety goggles to protect against any splashing or spillage.
Try heating slightly more than one liter of oil to produce a liter of prepared oil, as some volume is lost during filtering.

, Place a piece of cheesecloth or a coffee filter into a funnel. Place the funnel on top of another clean plastic container labeled “screened oil” or something similar. Carefully pour the heated oil through this prepared funnel and into the container to catch large food particles.For a larger amount of oil, you can use a screen placed over a large, clean bucket. Use a screen intended for paint or windows, and pour the used oil through it and into the clean bucket.
Discard the cheesecloth, coffee filter, or screen with the particles that were caught, or rinse thoroughly for future use if applicable.

, Pour your screened oil back into the cooking pot, after washing out the pot thoroughly. Return it to the electric burner and heat at a consistent 140ºF for 15 minutes to allow any water to separate from the oil.Monitor the temperature closely with a cooking thermometer. The heat should not reach above 140ºF, as you will run the risk of steam explosions from the water that settles at the bottom.

, After it has cooled, return the oil to a plastic container, either the one you used last or a new, clean container labeled “settling oil” or something similar. Let the oil sit for at least 24 hours to allow the water to further settle to the bottom of the container.


Observe the container after 24 hours. The water should have settled into a defined layer at the bottom of the container, and it will be cloudy and light tan in color, not clear., After settling is complete, pour the oil slowly into a new, clean container labeled “filtered oil” or something similar, taking care not to pour the settled water in with the oil.


Water can negatively affect the quality of your biodiesel fuel. The less water content in the oil, the easier the next steps of the biodiesel process will be.

, In a glass container, add a gram of lye to one liter of distilled water. This is a 0.1% lye solution used as a testing device for the pH level of your oil.Use extreme care when handling lye, as it is a toxic substance. Wear eye protection and rubber gloves at all times, handle in a well-ventilated space, and be sure to label your lye and 0.1% lye solution clearly. If lye gets onto your skin, neutralize it immediately with vinegar, and rinse with cool water.You can obtain lye as a household drain cleaning product, but you must ensure that it is 100% lye with no other ingredients added. If you order from a chemical supplier, you can use sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH)Use the same ratio of lye to distilled water if you want to make a larger or smaller quantity of test solution. You can store this solution with a tight lid for testing of future oil batches.

, In a separate glass container, pour 1 ml of your filtered oil and 10 ml of isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. Warm the mixture gently by placing the container into hot water, then stir until the mixture is clear.


Wooden chopsticks work well to stir the oil and alcohol., Get phenolphthalein solution from a chemical supplier to use as a pH indicator, as it visibly turns from clear to pink at a pH level of 8.5, which is the level you want for creating biodiesel. Add two drops of phenolphthalein to your oil and alcohol mixture.


You can use a pH meter, pH test strips, or a natural food-based pH indicator like red cabbage juice instead, but you may not get as easy-to-read or accurate indications as with phenolphthalein.You will use this indicator to determine the right level of lye to add to your oil to create an ideal pH level.

, Slowly drip your lye solution into the container with oil, alcohol, and phenolphthalein. Stir continuously. Stop adding the lye solution when your mixture achieves a pink or magenta color and holds that color for 15 seconds, indicating the correct pH level.Add your lye solution using a graduated syringe or pipette so that you can note exactly how much lye is used. The number of milliliters used to turn the mixture pink for 15 seconds is the same number of grams you’ll need to add to the basic quantity of lye used for the biodiesel process.Aim for a quality of oil that needs 2.5-3.5 ml of lye to turn the mixture pink. You may need to try oil from a number of different sources to find this quality, which is ideal for beginners. Discard oil that requires a very high quantity of lye and try again with oil from a different source., After you’ve determined the acidity of your oil, you can complete the rest of the chemical reaction to create biodiesel using your filtered oil, lye, and methanol.


Follow reliable and safe instructions to complete the rest of the biodiesel process.
Note that you will add the results of your titration test (the number of milliliters of lye needed to turn your mixture pink) to the quantity of lye your biodiesel instructions call for."

Invest in furniture sliders.You can buy the sliders of appropriate size at your local hardware or home goods store.,
Place your sliders under the corners of the furniture.,
Push the furniture.",How to Move Heavy Furniture1," National chains like Home Depot or Lowes will definitely sell furniture sliders. If you are planning to move your furniture over carpet or grass you should buy sliders that specialize in that movement.


If you don’t have any sliders you can also try using Frisbees.;
, Lift each corner and put a slider underneath so that the smooth edge is towards the floor. This will reduce the friction and make moving much easier.

, Once you have the sliders under the corners of the furniture you can begin to push it. Having another person would be helpful to insure that the furniture does not tip. Push the furniture from a lower section rather than the top to minimize the risk of tipping. The friction is almost eliminated with sliders and the furniture should move very easily.

Understand the parts of your analog meter (also known as a dial meter) and how it works.,
Read the dials on your meter.,
Find out how your electric company reads the last dial.,
Calculate the kilowatt hours you have used.",How to Read an Electric Meter1," Your electric meter usually has between four and six dials that advance as a central disk turns.The disk is turned by the electricity passing through the meter, giving a readout of how much electricity you are using. This readout is given in kilowatt hours. One kilowatt hour is equal to the amount of energy it would take to power a 100 watt lightbulb for 10 hours.There may be a variety of words and numbers printed on the face of your electric meter. While these are not important in determining your electric usage, they do give you information about the mechanical details of your meter.;
, Read them from left to right, just as you would if you were reading a book or a set of numbers. Begin on the left, writing the numbers down as you go. After you mark a number for each dial across, you have the electric meter reading.


Do not let the direction of the numbers on each dial confuse you. Some of the dials will be numbered clockwise and other dials may be numbered counterclockwise.
Look exactly where the arrow is pointing. If the arrow is pointing between 2 numbers, the reading is the smaller number. If the arrow is pointing directly on a number, verify what the number should be by referencing the dial to the right of it. If the arrow on that dial is past zero, the reading on the dial to the left is the number the arrow is pointing to. If the arrow on the right hand dial is not to or past the zero yet, the reading on the dial to the left is the previous number.

, Some companies round up to the next highest number. Other companies record the number that the arrow is closest to. If you are interested in calculating your kilowatt hours on your own and getting a calculation close to what the electric company does, it is beneficial to know how the company reads this last number.

, Most electric companies do not reset the meter to zero after every reading. This means that in order to calculate the number of kilowatt hours you have used, you need to keep track of consecutive readings. Subtract the current reading from the last reading you were billed for to get the most recent kilowatt hours used.

Create a living budget.,
Start looking for employment.,
Apply for a visa, if necessary.,
File paperwork to move your business.,
Rent, timeshare, or buy a home.",How to Move to the US Virgin Islands2," Go through your finances and determine exactly how much you can spend on housing, food, entertainment, and other expenses each month. Estimate how much income you will be bringing in as well. This is especially important because island prices can come as a shock to some. The USVI follow the U.S. dollar, but the cost of particular items are often much more than the mainland.


There are a variety of websites online that will give you a price comparison on some of the most commonly purchased goods. Eggs, for example, might cost you up to $6 per dozen. A gallon of regular milk can go up to $9., If you already have a job waiting for you, that’s great. If not, then start your search months in advance by browsing some of the main career websites, such as Craigslist and Indeed. The USVI moving forums might provide you with some leads as well. It’s best to flexible when looking for a position, as many people come to the islands and switch career paths completely.For example, it is not uncommon to hear about accountants becoming yoga instructors or hotel staffers. The key is to stay open-minded while still selling your current skill set., A non-U.S. resident will need to apply for an H1B, H2B, or student visa. You can find a detailed list of the requirements for these different visas at the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services website. The H1B visa is the most common choice for professionals with a long-term job waiting in the USVI. The H2B visa is more short-term and intended for seasonal workers and the like. A student visa covers those persons attending a university on the islands., Operating a business in the USVI requires that you get a license from the Department of Licensing and Consumer Affairs (DLCA), which covers all four islands. Your DCLA application will then put you in contact with other agencies of importance, such as the Police Department and Department of Planning and Natural Resources (for zoning).Many companies move to the USVI due to the tax advantages offered, relative to the U.S. Some businesses see a reduction of up to 90% on corporate income tax., Each island has a Board of Realtors who can help you find a home to buy or rent. Owning a timeshare, renting, or leasing provides more flexibility if you believe that you’ll move around a bit between the islands. On the other hand, buying a home can be a good investment for anyone with ample funds who is looking to settle for a while.On St. Thomas, for example, the average home price averages just over $500,000 for any given year. Condos start at around $150,000 and can be a more affordable option.Some people prefer to purchase land and build a home on it. To do this you’ll need to work with a real estate attorney. Keep in mind that building can be quite costly as all materials must be imported.Make sure to set up any utilities for your home well in advance. Most places offer a combination of electricity, water, and gas, often provided by the city."

Look over a good map.,
Study local etiquette.,
Locate new schools for any children.,
Get a new driver’s license.,
Wait 30 days to apply for residency.",How to Move to the US Virgin Islands3," Before you move or right after you arrive, get a map that shows each part of your island. One that lists landmarks and specific addresses is even better. Be prepared to see many versions of the same name, such as Contant and Upper Contant. Study this map as often as you can and write notes on it for reference.Informal landmarks, such as unusual trees, are used for navigation purposes as well. You can expect to learn these over time.

, Every island, and even each neighborhood, has its own set of particular mannerisms. As you settle in start to watch how people around you behave in certain situations and try to mirror their actions. For example, it is common to say “good morning” to everyone you meet on the islands, even if they are strangers. Not doing so will mark you to the locals as a tourist.Reading the local newspaper is a great way to understand what is going on around you. All of the big three islands have a specific newspaper that covers their activities. For example, in St. John you’ll want to read the St. John Tradewinds News., Either immediately before or shortly after you move, start to look into the local education options. Both private and public schools are available for school-age children. Be aware that your children may need to travel by bus or ferry to get to certain locations. The U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Education provides a K-12 listing for interested parents., The Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) handles all license transactions. If you have a valid U.S. or foreign license it can usually be transferred without any additional tests. If you need an entirely new license, then you will need to take both written and driving tests. All of these actions require forms and fees, so check with the BMV before arriving.Be aware that USVI residents drive American style left-hand cars. But, unlike mainland Americans, they drive on the left side of the road, like the British. This can be a bit of a shock to new island drivers., If you are currently a U.S. citizen, after a month living on the island you can begin the process of applying for permanent resident status. You’ll need to show your birth certificate or passport along with a completed naturalization certificate. When this process is finished you’ll be able to vote."

Walk to local destinations.,
Ride a bike for long distances.,
Rely on mass transportation.,
Set up a carpool with your friends, co-workers, or family members.,
Invest in a motorcycle or scooter.",How to Reduce Your Dependence on a Car2," You may be surprised by how often you drive to locations that can be easily reached on foot. Even those tricky shopping excursions can be made walkable if your store is close to your house and you have a cart or wagon to hold your groceries.Walking is excellent exercise, so think of your walks as making both you and the earth healthier.
If you’re walking to work, you may need to wear sneakers and pack your work shoes in your bag. You probably won’t be the only one rocking the beat-up sneakers and pantsuit look in the morning, so don’t worry about looking unprofessional.

, If you have good weather, safe terrain, and feasible distances, cycle to your destinations. Even more so than walking, biking is an excellent form of cardiovascular exercise. You can even use your bike to combine your commute with your trip to the gym!Drive the route first to make sure that it is safe for biking. Additionally, cycling comes with its own rules of the road, so learn the protocol before heading out.
If you’re cycling to work, make arrangements to shower or freshen up once you arrive. Keep a spare set of dry, clean clothes in your office for emergencies.

, Not all cities and towns have public transportation options. If yours does, commit to using it. It may not always be fun taking the often-crowded bus or underground, but mass transit is a great and eco-friendly alternative to driving.You may be able to increase your positive outlook toward mass transportation by considering the benefits. A train ride may give you a quiet hour to catch up on your pleasure reading or finish your presentation before work starts.
If you live in a rural area that doesn’t have public transportation options, approach your local government with the possibility of adding a bus route from popular residential neighborhoods to your town’s main shopping areas. If the proposal receives support from a majority of residents, it may become a reality!

, The process of decreasing your vehicle dependence can be a team effort. Carpooling may be your best option especially if you live in an area without good public transportation options. If you, your family, friends, and/or co-workers frequently visit the same places together, there’s no reason not to travel in groups and take turns driving.


If you’re struggling to find fellow commuters to carpool with, try apps designed for that purpose. Carma and Ride both match commuters for carpools., If you’re looking for alternative means to travel longer distances than a few miles, consider purchasing a motorcycle or a scooter. These vehicles use less gas than cars, and they provide a great and fun way to limit your carbon footprint.


Before you ride your new vehicle in traffic, be sure you’ve practiced and are prepared to go out on the road safely.
Some states will require you to have a different license or registration for this type of vehicle. Make sure you’re adhering to local and state laws before you ride.

Use a shoulder dolly.,
Use moving blankets.,
Use a moving dolly.,
Place a glossy magazine under the corners.Glossy magazines can help reduce friction with the floor and allow you to drag the entire piece of furniture.",How to Move Heavy Furniture2," These are lifting straps that connect to your shoulders and help take the weight off your back. They help you utilize your stronger muscle groups while also giving you added leverage. You can buy a shoulder dolly online.


Shoulder dolly’s are not recommended for moving furniture up or down stairs – the weight will shift almost completely to the person on the bottom., Instead of sliders you can also use the moving blankets that are generally used to keep furniture safe during a move.Moving blankets work in a similar way to sliders, although you will put the entire blanket under the piece of furniture. Once the entire blanket is under the furniture you can start pulling the blanket in the direction you want to move. The furniture should slide along with it. This is much easier than trying to lift the whole thing.If you need to move heavy furniture up stairs you can fold up a bunch of moving blankets and place them on each step to turn your stairs into a makeshift ramp. Once you’ve done that you can place another blanket under the piece of furniture and pull the edge to move the furniture up the steps. If your steps are particularly steep it would be a good idea to have a friend steady the back of the furniture., A hand truck or a square moving dolly could be good options depending on the type of furniture you’re moving. A hand truck is a piece of metal moving equipment that stands upright with wheels on the bottom. The handle is at the top and a platform to hold the furniture is at the bottom by the wheels. Moving dollys are small square platforms with four wheels. You can find moving dolly’s of all different sizes.


Use a hand truck to move furniture by wheeling the platform under the piece of furniture you’re trying to move. A hand truck will work well for smaller bookcases, tables, and dressers. Lean the furniture against the hand truck and tilt the handle toward you. The furniture will lean with the hand truck and you’ll be able to wheel it around. This is much easier than pushing it.
Be very careful with hand trucks. If you try to move a piece of furniture that is too large it could fall and crush you. Your strength will be keeping the furniture upright.
Moving dollys are very easy to use. All you need to do is place the furniture on top of them and then you’ll be able to use the dolly's wheels to push it around. Make sure you find a dolly that is large enough for the piece of furniture you plan to move.
Having a friend to help you pick up the furniture would make the process of getting it on the dolly easier.

, You won’t damage the floor and you won’t feel the weight of the furniture nearly as much. However, you will probably destroy the magazine.


Having someone to help you lift up each corner of the furniture while you place the magazines would make the process much easier. You can also try placing the magazines on the floor, lifting the corners by yourself, and then pushing the magazine under the corner using your foot.

"
"
Use a high-low method.,
Bend from the knees and hips when lifting furniture.,
Hook chairs around corners.,
Take the legs off heavy tables and the drawers out of dressers.,
Remove everything from a bookshelf before you move it.,
Consider hiring movers.",How to Move Heavy Furniture3," You will need two people to use this method, but it works well if you have to manually move large pieces of furniture like a large dresser or bookcase. Tilt the furniture backward so that one person carries the top of it while the other side stays low and the second person carries the bottom.Maintain this angle as you move.


This way you don’t have to lift the furniture all the way back up when you are ready to set it upright. It will also fit the angle of stairs more easily.

, Use your core and legs to lift heavy furniture rather than bending from the waist and using your back to lift. You can really hurt yourself if you try to use your back. Your thighs are strong and less prone to injury.

, Turn the chair on its side in an ‘L’ shape. This will make it much easier to fit the chair through doors and sharp corners.Moving heavy furniture is difficult enough as it is without having to maneuver your way through doors with trial and error.


Move the back of the chair through the doorway or corner first and then curl around the door frame to get it through easily.
If you’re confused about how to bend from your hips, start by squatting. Pick up the furniture from the squatting position using your legs to propel you upward.

, The lighter you can make a piece of furniture before you move it, the better. Taking the legs off of a heavy table will make it much less unwieldy. If the table can be broken up into separate sections then move each section one by one.


Separating a piece of furniture into component parts is always a good tactic. Remove each drawer from your dresser prior to moving it. That way you can transport the drawers individually and then come back for the dress itself.

, Trying to move a bookcase filled up with books will be a very challenging task. It’s going to be a lot heavier and you’ll have to worry about balancing the bookcase correctly so nothing falls out.


Take the time to remove the books. It will save you time and energy in the long run.

, If you are unable to find anyone to help you it is probably not a good idea to try to move a massive dresser down a flight of stairs. You might damage your house, break the furniture, or seriously injure yourself. Hiring movers can be pretty affordable if you’re only moving a few items.

Enable power management on your computer.

,
Power management software is used to put your computer in a sleep state if it is not used for a period of time.,Get longer wear from your laptop battery

,
Laptops use about half as much power as a PC.",How to Reduce The Environmental Footprint of Your IT Gear and Computer2,", A computer and monitor left on can use over $300 of electricity per year. Computer equipment will last longer if it is set to ""hibernate"" when not in use.

,, But the battery can be a source of additional pollution and expense. Batteries are only capable of a finite number of charges. To extend the life of your laptop battery, remove your laptop battery when your laptop is plugged in to a power outlet. To know when to recharge your battery, you should determine if it is lithium-ion or nickel cadmium. A lithium ion battery should be recharged before it is completely depleted, discharging it completely once per month. A nickel-cadmium battery, more commonly used in older laptops, should be fully depleted and recharged each time.

A thin client is a device that depends on the main server for processing.,
Turn your computers and equipment off.

,
Plug your computer into a power strip that can be shut off when it is not in use.",How to Reduce The Environmental Footprint of Your IT Gear and Computer3,", A thin client has several advantages such as decreasing the need for technical support, being less susceptible to viruses, being smaller and less costly, and storing data more safely. Thin clients do not ""wear out"" or become outdated like personal computers. Feeling even more frugal? You can use any old workstation as a thin client without any upgrades at all.

,, So-called ""Vampire power"" (power used even when the device is turned off) can consume up to 10% of your electric bill.

Understand the different parts of your meter.,
Read the numbers on your meter.,
Calculate the kilowatt hours you have used.",How to Read an Electric Meter2," A digital electric meter records the amount of electricity your household is using electronically. Thus, a digital electric meter is much simpler to read than a traditional meter because it has fewer readings to decipher.Unlike traditional analog electric meters, many digital meters transmit your meter reading wirelessly to the electric company via radio frequencies.This means that you will not have a meter reader come to your house to read your meter. If you prefer to keep your traditional meter, it may be possible in some municipalities to avoid having a new ""smart"" meter installed., Your meter should have a digital readout that gives you one long series of numbers. The exact configuration on this readout will vary depending on the manufacturer and the readout could include .Contact your electric company to get information about your meter if you cannot figure out how to read it on your own.
Your electric meter may have a few other numbers displayed, including power status for the meter and reference numbers for the electric company.Remember to only pay attention to the large central string of numbers when trying to figure out your electric usage.

, Digital electric meters do not reset after every reading. This means that in order to calculate the number of kilowatt hours you have used, you need to keep track of consecutive readings. Subtract the current reading from the last reading you were billed for to get the most recent kilowatt hours used.

Ensure safety first.,
Measure the catalyst.,
Mix the methoxide.,
Add methoxide to the heated oil.,
Water-wash.After all the glycerin is drained (up to 24hours), turn on the pump and add water to the oil to start the water wash. Keep it simple.",How to Mix Your Biodiesel," You are working with some chemicals and vapors that could be dangerous if handled incorrectly. It is very important for you to wear the proper safety equipment and work in a well-ventilated area. Make sure to wear rubber gloves and face shield at all times. The tiny dust particles in the potassium hydroxide could cause irritation and damage if inhaled. The face shield and dusk mask will help keep the dust particles and any chemical splash away from your face.;
, For each liter of oil you're going to turn into biodiesel, you need seven grams of potassium hydroxide. In addition to that, you need to add ""extra"" grams of potassium hydroxide equal to the titration. To break it down nice and easy: if your oil titrates at 2, you need 7 plus 2 or 9 grams (0.071 or 0.32 oz) of potassium hydroxide for each liter of oil. Place the plastic container on the scale and fill it with the correct amount of potassium hydroxide.

, When you have measured out the amount of potassium hydroxide you will need for your batch of biodiesel, grab your funnel and place it on the container with the methanol. Make sure the amount of methanol you use is 20% to 22% of the original volume of your batch of oil. Pour in the potassium hydroxide and let it settle.
Place the valve cap on the container of methanol.






As the potassium hydroxide dissolves into the methanol, the mixture will heat up and boil. Bubbles will appear on the bottom of the plastic container. Hold the plastic container away from you and open the valve to release the vapor pressure. These vapors can be very dangerous if inhaled, so keep the end of the container an arm's length away from your face shield as you release the vapors.






Release the vapors about every 20 seconds until the potassium hydroxide is completely dissolved. You can tell by looking at the bottom of the container.






Once dissolved, you can add this “methoxide” to the oil in your processor.







, The oil in your processor should be heated to somewhere between 120 and 130 degrees Fahrenheit before you add the methoxide. The heat cannot rise above 140 °F (60 °C) because it will cause the methanol to boil. Slowly add the methoxide into the processor. it should be added relatively slowly; taking about five or ten minutes to add into the oil through an inlet to the pump.


Drain the glycerin waste product from the mix. Your oil will change from dark (glycerin) to light (crude biodiesel) in color as it is drained.

, You need 5% of the original oil volume and let the water circulate in the tank for about 15 minutes. If you have 40 gallons (151.4 L) of oil, you need two gallons of water. Let this circulate and then replace the dirty water with clean... repeat these steps until the water stays clearer as you have washed out many of the impurities out of the oil. You may then finally dry you fuel to remove any water suspended in it. Heat the fuel and ideally recirculate by spraying it back in. This will dry the fuel a lot quicker. When you take sample ensure that the fuel is bright and clear. Keeping drying it for a further 15 minutes to ensure when it cools it remains water free.

Renewable energy sources are an excellent way to do this. Install solar panels to harness the power of the sun, build wind turbines, or power your home through a hydropower system. You may also consider installing a generator so you can power your own electric items.Make a bicycle generator. Bike generators are both a great way to get exercise and a great way to charge your electronics. You can order the plans for bike generators online, or you can order pre made bike generators.






You should also consider using alternative fuels like biodiesel, biomass, and Ethanol.





;
, There are several viable options for how to best light your house. One of the best is the kerosene lantern. You could also use kerosene wick lamps, candles, and battery-charged camping lanterns. It’s also important to have flashlights on hand for when you need to get up in the middle of the night but don’t have any lights to turn on.If you decide to get a bicycle generator, you will be able to light your the lamps in your house.







, This means adding extra insulation to your house’s walls, particularly in the attic and around doorways. Heat escapes under doorways, around windows and through the upper regions of the house. Create an insulation system that will let as little heat escape as possible. Buy door sweeps to block up the undersides of doors.


You should also consider using a window insulator kit to block air leaking through your windows. You can either purchase a ready made window insulation kit, or make your own.







, If you do not have a fireplace or wood-burning stove, you should seriously consider building one, especially if you live in a cold climate. To heat other rooms in the house, you can consider building vents onto your fireplace that lead to the other rooms., One of the best ways to cook without using any electricity is to install a wood stove. When it gets too hot to cook over the wood stove, use propane or butane camping stoves (which act exactly like any other gas stove.)


If you have a gas stove, you can still use it without using electricity. You will just have to light the burners with matches or a lighter.







, Rather than purchasing fruits and vegetables from a store, why not grow your own? With just a few seeds, you can turn your yard into a cornucopia of produce. Growing your crops on your own land will also mean that you have control over what sort of contaminants your food is exposed to.


Plant crops that will produce fruits and vegetables at different times of the year, that way you have delicious food to eat all year round.






If you are really serious about growing a lot of crops, you will need to learn about crop rotation. To read more about farming crops in large quantities and crop rotation, click here.







Plant an herb garden so that you can have fresh and delicious herbs. Dry some of the herbs so that you can use them year round.







, If you have the space to do so, you should consider raising livestock. Cows, goats, and sheep are all excellent dairy sources, chickens provide eggs and meat, and pigs can help you compost as well as provide you with food. You can sell, trade, or keep what your livestock produces.Build a chicken coop to house your chickens. Your chicken coop should have room for your chickens to wander around in, as well as some cubby holes where they can lay their eggs.







, A large part of living without electricity is being able to preserve food, even when you don’t have a refrigerator to store it in. Nearly everything can be canned--from fruits and vegetables, to meat and eggs, canning is an excellent way to preserve your fresh produce. If you plan on doing a lot of canning, you should consider purchasing a pressure canner. Pressure canners make the canning process a lot more efficient.



Pickle other foods that you want to preserve. Pickled food can be great during the winter when fresh food is less available.







Dry fruits, vegetables and meat. Drying food is also an excellent way to store food without using electricity.







, Compost is incredibly handy, particularly when you do not want to pay for city trash services. Not only will a compost pile help you achieve nutrient rich fertilizer, it is also relatively easy to build.

, It is particularly easy to do this if you raise livestock. Your garden will be particularly grateful to you if you feed it with your own homemade organic fertilizer.

, Consider your skills--are you good at sewing, cooking, carving, building, etc.? Determine what supplies you might need to make things in bulk. Also consider what products you can make from what you already have. Are you raising sheep? Then learn how to knit or make cheese out of your sheep's milk.

, While this may seem like a daunting task, it becomes easy with practice. Scrub your clothes against a washboard, rinse them, and then hang them out to dry.


The secret to soft clothing is to rinse your clothes with one or two cups of vinegar before hanging them to dry. The vinegar will keep your clothes from getting too stiff while they air dry.

These items include: a flashlight, extra batteries, a multipurpose tool (such as a Swiss Army knife), a manual can opener, seven days worth of your medications, sanitation items, extra cash, a portable radio, and an emergency blanket.You should also make copies of your personal documents. These include important medical information, passport, proof of address, and your birth certificate. You should also have a map of the area and a list of emergency contacts.

, In a power outage, you never know what might happen (or who might need doctoring.) Because of this, it is strongly recommended that you keep a first aid kit in your house. You can buy first aid kits that are fully stocked, or put your own kit together. For a full list of all of the items you should put in your first aid kit, click here., The Red Cross suggests stockpiling at least a gallon of water per person per day. If possible, get enough water to last you a week at a minimum (so, if you are a family of three, that would mean purchasing 21 gallons of water.)


If you are unable to purchase or store this much water and are afraid your drinking water would be compromised in an emergency, you can also purify water during the emergency. Learn how to purify water here.







, These food items should be easy to make or, even better, take no preparation at all. If you do not have access to a heat source, such as a grill or camp stove (which are covered in Part Two) then you should mostly stockpile non-perishables that do not need to be cooked.Non-perishables that need to be cooked: Canned soup, macaroni and cheese,






Non-perishables that don’t need cooking: Canned nuts, canned vegetables and fruits, peanut butter, granola bars, crackers and chips, canned meats, pre packaged pudding, and unopened bottles of juice.







, If the power goes out or you find yourself in an emergency situation, use your phone to call your family members before your phone dies (since you won’t be able to charge it after the battery runs out.)

, Because you won’t be able to use your TV, computer or any other electronic item, you will need to find some entertainment for yourself. However, its good to keep in mind that you shouldn’t waste your flashlight’s batteries by shining it on a book at night. If you have lanterns or candles, set one up at a table so that everyone can gather around it to read, play games, or talk.

, These include multiple flashlights, camping lanterns, and candles. Store your flashlights where you can find them quickly in the dark. Candles are great because they last a long time without wasting battery life. Lanterns are especially useful when trying to go about daily life in the dark. Illuminate your kitchen with a lantern while you cook.

, If you have a fireplace, it would be a good idea to stockpile wood. Close off rooms that are not being used because what little heat you do have will spread out throughout the house. You could also consider investing in a kerosene heater. While these heaters will warm the house, they must be placed near a vent or else they could lead to carbon monoxide build up., If you can get outside to your car, you may want to charge your more absolutely necessary electronics (such as cell phones for contacting family members and rechargeable flashlights.) You can charge your electronics through your cigarette lighter in your car (which is connected to the cars battery.)

, The best way to do this is by purchasing a block of dry ice, wrapping it in newspaper, and placing it in your refrigerator. Find out where you can purchase dry ice today, so you know where to go in case of an emergency.Open your fridge and freezer only when absolutely necessary. You can also cover your fridge and freezer with thick blankets to keep the temperature inside down. Make sure the blankets do not cover your fridge or freezer vents.

, Before you dive into the non perishable foods you have stocked up on, consider cooking the perishable food you have left in your refrigerator. Only do this on the first day of the blackout, as most refrigerated food should not be eaten after it has been sitting in temperatures above 40ºF (4.4ºC) for longer than two hours.


Exceptions to this rule are hard cheeses, processed cheese, fresh fruits and vegetables, butter/margarine, and bread., If you are lucky enough to have a gas stove during a power outage, then you should be fine when it comes to cooking your food. You will have to light the ranges by hand, but other than that, you should be good to go. If, however, you have an electric stove, alternative cooking methods are listed below.Never use your gas stove or oven to heat your house. These appliances are not meant to do that and will cause a dangerous increase in the amount of carbon monoxide in your house.

, If you have a camping stove and can’t cook on your electric range, then its time you blew the dust off that propane or butane can. These camping stoves essentially work the same as a regular gas stove. Grills and barbecues will also work in a power outage. Just make sure you don’t use them inside, or else they could cause carbon monoxide build up, which can be very dangerous.

, If you have a fireplace, use it. If you don’t, you may need to make a campfire in your backyard. If you are living in an area that is prone to blackouts and you don’t have a fireplace, you might want to consider delegating a corner of your backyard for a campfire area.

, If you can leave your house, you may consider going out to eat. Chances are, you will most likely get a little stir crazy if you have to stay in the house so go out to eat during the day.

Switch your light bulbs to compact fluorescent bulbs.,
Install solar panels and reap the benefits easily.,
Wash clothes in cold water.,
Air dry your clothes.,
When shopping for new appliances, choose the ones where the energy star rating is in the most efficient range.,
Unplug appliances that are not in use.",How to Make Your Home Greener2," They use 75% less energy and last up to ten times longer than incandescent bulbs. It would only take three months to make up for the higher sticker price.

, It is important, however, that you do your homework before making the leap. The most important thing you need to consider is the amount of sun your home gets regularly. If your home is shaded, the amount of energy collected from solar panels will be greatly reduced., This can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 1,281 pounds a year, and saves on your energy bill.

, The dryer in your home takes up a lot of energy and it is quite simple to just hang your clothes and allow them to air dry. If you do need to use the dryer, then be sure to clean out the lint to help it work more efficiently.

, Even if you cannot afford new appliances, you can choose new parts for your old appliances that are much more efficient and will help your old appliances save money and energy like new ones., Many appliances use energy even when turned off. This is called ""vampire"" electricity. Kill the vampire and save both energy and money.

Set up a compost bin.,
Don't throw away coffee grounds.,
Stop the junk mail.,
Go green on your coffee break by bringing your own cup.",How to Make Your Home Greener3," It's an inexpensive way to reduce kitchen and garden waste from your household. By composting leaves, grass clippings, and certain kitchen waste, you can create your own nutrient-rich soil that reduces the need for commercial chemical fertilizers in your garden.

, Use them to fertilize your plants. Coffee grounds are rich in nitrogen so these make great, healthy plant food. Using coffee grounds as fertilizer keeps them out of the landfill, makes it unnecessary for you to purchase and use chemical plant food, and help your plants grow nicely, adding oxygen to the atmosphere. You can also add them to your compost bin., Cutting out junk mail that nobody wants anyway is one of the most effective ways to reduce pollution. A great and easy alternative medium is email. Most businesses have electronic notification and payment options. Choosing these will reduce resource and energy use.

, If you usually order a Tall Latte at Starbucks, bring a tall re-usable coffee mug with you. Every time you ask your favorite coffee shop to put your drink in your own cup, you are helping to green your environment."

Use more eco-friendly cleaners.,
Plant trees around your home.",How to Make Your Home Greener4," At least use less of your current detergents and bleaches. Experiment to find the least amount of chemicals you can use to achieve satisfactory results. Use natural cleaning boosters. There are many formulations online. Research these and pick a laundry booster that is biodegradable and requires little energy to produce and distribute.

, The trees will help provide shade for you home and, therefore, will help keep your home cooler in the hot summer months. It will not require as much air conditioning to keep it at your desired temperature. Deciduous trees lose leaves in the winter, so they will still allow the sun to come in and help heat your home during the winter months."

Purchase a new terracotta pot and saucer.,
Remove all price and manufacturing stickers from the pot and saucer.,
Sit the pot and saucer on your kitchen sink.",How to Make a Cutlery Drainer Using a Terracotta Pot," Ensure that it is large enough to suit your needs in terms of cutlery.


If using a used pot, ensure that it is well cleaned and all dirt has been taken off it. Avoid using a used one that looks ragged or is chipped.;
, Give it a wash.

, When you wash cutlery by hand, lean the pieces upright inside the pot. The water will drain into the saucer, which you can empty by hand afterwards. The cutlery has plenty of room to drain and even air dry if you don't feel like drying up straight away.


If you can't place the pot on the sink, place it on a non-porous saucer, so as not to spoil the surface it is sitting on. However, you'll need to empty the water from it after each drying session, to avoid spills.

Break out of doldrums.,
Bring ""urgent"" -- exciting, important or thrilling ideas and events to the forefront of your life view -- for example:


Plan for education, career, spiritual matters, health -- but make time for your reading, meditation on your area of studies -- even relaxation, that may all be important to you.,
Start by scheduling your priority items: not prioritizing your schedule.

,
Change your schedule to your priorities -- not the other way around.,
Effectively Track and Accomplish Your Goals, ie: how you achieve goals should be ""on purpose."",
Make time to do things that matter early each day; so that first things come first, before whatever else you can do that doesn't matter as much.,
Pay yourself first.,
Do an exciting, fun inventory to organize your goals and plans.,
Look ahead (planning not just hoping) about five years up the road: ""see what you want"" and then start to plan it out -- so focus energies now and focus every time you have a day of planning time like today on progress...

,
Write a Mission Statement: Determine your life’s meaning to provide a clue of where you must spend your time on activities for that outcome, on a foundation -- building on it.,
Align your purpose with a dream like a “career goal” and include keeping yourself out of excessive debt but so you can have the resources for travel if needed and for your mission adventures, and to be able to send your children to college, if appropriate.

,
Redirect your efforts from merely paying your bills which may mean little time for your ultimate, urgent goals – but you wish you were living your real purposes.,
Get excited to jump out of bed each morning -- and remember or determine each day what you will achieve?,
Find enough time in each day to do what truly matters...

,
Find what you can let go.,
Lock in your evenings, your dating life and/or family and evening meals as much as anything else in life.,
Treat your important mission as an emergency.,
Do not slide your future to the back.,
Clear unnecessary items off your schedule.",How to Live Urgently," Plan beyond ""tomorrow"" and the ""day-after-tomorrow""... but the most urgent day where you live is always today but it points to your tomorrow. Your life today has to be on or the path -- and it is necessary to work on success (that means progress), including getting the best advice if you need it, or school counseling, the help of others to reach the thrill of victory.;
, So you are getting lined-up to make it happen each day as you follow the path that you chose...

,, Stop Excuses: Get your big plan and your nuggets as objectives (most important goals) and your best idea into first place for working in and around your daily life and schedule. Your schedule may be necessary, but your goals should not be sliding back or off the path because of routine, daily troubles., Think about your family -- about handling life's short term and long term goals with them -- and with your friends and colleagues -- whatever applies. Some people along the way are helpful and some are less worthy, but treat them well.

, Pick your 3 or 4 Things to Do (ToDo's or TD's) early. Set priorities of which to do first, second, third,... early each day before spending time on tasks that matter so much less.

, It's an emergency. Maybe you want to write, read, work out, pray or plan at the break of dawn. Do it. Making your allotted 16 waking hours work for you each day. This way every day begins and stays positively aligned, if you start early toward your future and living the minutes, moment by moment.

, Make a two column list of your important or favorite ideas and skills and your less favorite ideas and memories, people and events -- and you’ll see how and why you became the person who reached where you are today.,, Maintain relationships today as part of life’s purpose and which help in achieving your life’s urgent mission.

,, Make that urgent to straighten it out., There are never enough hours in a day for everything.

,, Let it go. Check the possible consequences of not doing some goal -- of it not happening – but how much do those consequences matter to you. Look at the pay-off, rewards, and even if they sound impressive – but as an accomplishment they have little real meaning to you -- do you need that? You won't be satisfied with doing what doesn't matter to you. You don't care about it; regardless of how important it is to siblings parents, and greater family and others, or how impressive it may be to yourself -- or how important it was before, it may be time to:

Can you let go of getting a new/newer car every 2 years?
Can you let go of signing up for 30 years of payments for a more expensive house?

, It’s a commitment to your life -- the future.

, First things are critical: urgent.

, It must not backslide. Your routine can pause and stop; let those routine things fall, slide down, and make time to rise and climb into your future that matters.

, Time spent on what doesn’t matter is time you lose forever – and that is a tragedy for your hope in life, and your future. It is not someone's future; it's your urgent life. Walk it out, hurry to do what matters.

Consider the risks carefully before deciding who will be doing your tree work.,
Make sure the company is legitimate.,
Look for safety gear.,
Get the estimate in writing.,
Do not give any money down.,
Compare apples to apples.,
Be patient.,
Check the Better Business Bureau.",How to Choose the Right Tree Service," Hire trained, equipped professionals to do the work. It is far more difficult and dangerous work than most people realize. Do an Internet search for ""tree work accident"" and see what you find there. That will make you a believer. But tree work can be done safely, efficiently, and at a really good price if done by well-equipped, experienced professionals. Take a chance on your brother-in-law helping out with new drywall in the garage. Don't risk someone getting hurt because you think you can save a buck and have some fun by having a buddy do your tree work.;
, Do they have a business license and are they insured? Anyone can buy a chainsaw and put an ad in the paper calling themselves a tree service. It's a nice way to make money on the side. But tree work is very dangerous and requires trained, skilled professionals with the proper safety gear, rigging gear, license, and insurance.


Insurance - make sure the companies you are considering have current liability insurance and tell them you want to see a copy of it. Some companies will tell you they are insured when they really aren't. If you had work done by a company without insurance and there was an accident causing damage or injuries, you as the homeowner could be facing a long uphill battle. The property damage will not be covered and anyone getting injured on your property could possibly sue.
Business License - you can not get business insurance without a business license in the first place. Request a copy of the company's business license.

, The company's ground personnel should at least be using helmets with face shields or protective glasses and steel toe boots. The climber should have the latest in safety and climbing gear including the proper saddle, helmet, glasses, steel toe boots, and arborist climbing ropes. If someone shows up with a ladder you should politely ask them to leave. Tell them you don't have the money right now. Tree services never use ladders and always use safety and rigging gear specially designed and manufactured with the rigors of tree work in mind. Lowering heavy pieces of wood causes a tremendous amount of friction and shock-loads the ropes and pulleys. Specially designed gear will keep the workers safe, your home safe, and the job running smoothly.

, In order to protect yourself, make sure the estimate is in writing. Don't take someone's word for it. A legitimate business will always put their offer in writing, no questions asked.

, A tree service should never ask for any money up front. There are no materials furnished for doing tree work - just manpower. A home improvement contractor may ask for money up front so that materials for the job may be purchased, but there is no reason for a tree service to ask for money down. There are numerous horror stories out there that begin with customers paying money up front to someone for doing tree work and it goes downhill from there. You shouldn't have to pay anything until the job is complete and you are completely satisfied with the work.

, Make sure that when you are getting estimates, the details match up. If the company you are considering meets all of the criteria above, make sure the work they will be doing is clearly understood. Will they be hauling away the brush or leaving it? What about the larger pieces? Will they be trimming only the dead branches or will the entire tree be shaped? Will the stump be ground? Will the leaves and twigs be raked up at the end of the job or will it look like a tornado came through when they are finished? Ask questions and make sure your expectations are clearly understood. Once again, don't forget to get everything in writing.

, Pricing can vary drastically from company to company. Some companies are better equipped for certain jobs and will try to compensate for other types of jobs by bidding them high. Sometimes a company is busy, sometimes they're slow. That also affects pricing. There are many factors that will affect pricing. Be patient, shop around, and negotiate. But please remember - tree work is not a commodity where only price matters. Tree work is risky and there is a dollar value worth paying to know it is being done by a company that is experienced, well-equipped, and insured.

, Companies that belongs to the BBB have always been held in higher regard. The BBB will keep track of any complaints against a company and hold them responsible for rectifying the situation. Any companies that do not take excellent care of their customers will quickly gather complaints on their record and if not resolved, they will be expelled from the BBB. If you are considering any companies that do not belong to the BBB, you should at least find out why they are not members. You should also check with a consumer protection agency to find out if there have been any complaints against the company. Why would a company choose not to belong to the BBB? That's a great question.

Always do what's best for you.",How to Live in the Woods," How deep into the woods do you want to live? Think both geographically and philosophically. If you don't mind a short drive outside of the urban sprawl, you can live surrounded by woods and still have some of the conveniences of the city. You can usually have electricity run to your home and get hooked up to a rural water main. A brief commute and you can be at work, making the kind of money that would be hard for some to walk away from. Or were you thinking of something a little more intense?


This lifestyle still ties one down to the system; however, it offers most people enough of a reprieve to be happy. Others can't find happiness just on the other side of the suburbs. They desire to be further removed from the rat race, and live deeper in the woods.
As far as North America goes, great places to get your Thoreau on are British Columbia, the Pacific Northwest of the States, and vast expanses like Montana. Just make sure you're near water! Where you choose all depends on what you have in mind and what kind of weather you're willing to, well, weather.;
, So many of us take for granted modern conveniences. We turn on our faucet and out comes water. Want light? Flip a switch. Want heat? Just turn up the thermostat. We forget how easy we have it. Although paying for them monthly can be challenging, having a well drilled and installing solar panels and wind turbines require a substantial initial investment that most people simply can't afford. Heating with wood is an option, but cutting wood is back breaking, time consuming work, that would probably have most wishing for the days they paid for their heat. So plan out your utilities! It will help you decide where and how you want to live.


Do you want to live in a cabin in the mountains or do you want to pitch your own tent and live by the light of an oil lamp? Is the location you have in mind good year around or is it plain freezing in the winter? What about rainfall and other possibly dangerous hazards? Just how much work do you want to be doing?

, Most areas that you may want to live in are already owned (privately or publicly). If you want to be legal about it, you'll need to buy some land. However, there are seasonal camping passes you can obtain in most states that can also give you a taste of this lifestyle. Then there's squatting -- but that can get you in pretty big trouble. Know the laws of your area and the consequences for your actions before you do anything you may regret.

, If you want to truly live deeper in the woods you really need a community. Not just for your sanity, but to make it feasible. Pooling money is the only way most people can afford the high initial start up costs of living as far from the rat race as possible. Land purchase, construction materials, solar panels, and having a well drilled, are all very expensive. Even if you plan on living in a sleeping bag and foraging for nuts, a community will help you stay sane -- even if it's just one or two other people!


Want to find some communities that are already doing this? Three Rivers Recreation Area near Bend, Oregon; Breitenbush near Salem, Oregon; Dancing Rabbit in Missouri; Twin Oaks in Virginia; Earthhaven in North Carolina; Greater World Community near Taos, New Mexico; and Arcosanti Ecovillage in Arizona are all established off-the-grid communities.

Don’t attempt a move to the woods alone. Even if you did miraculously survive, it would not be the kind of existence anyone could stand for very long. We need human interaction to keep from going crazy. Isolation is the ultimate punishment, reserved for our worst prisoners, and it almost inevitably drives them to lunacy. There are stories of hermit mountain men in Alaska who would spend weeks traveling to another's cabin and sometimes just sit, not saying anything for a whole day, forgetting how to converse, but still craving being in the company of another human being. Unless you want to be a hermit, of course.



, It's not a good idea, when you're on this woods-living kick, to call up your mom/boss and tell them a thing or two about where they can stick it and then tell them you're going to go live in the woods. You may need them when a bear's attacked you or all the rice is gone. Whatever connections you're thinking about leaving behind, do it tactfully. You may need them later.


Let everyone that you care about, that cares about you, know of your plan. Explain your reasons as logically as possible. Most of them will probably be naysayers, most of them probably won't understand, and that's fine. They don't need to. But they do deserve the privilege of knowing and not worrying about you.

, Capitalism has a tendency to stick in the craw of some of us and have us swearing that, ""We'd be better off living in the woods!"" Sure, society has gotten to you, the materialism of every inch of this world is heartbreaking, but just try it temporarily at first. Seriously. You wouldn't buy a house without looking at it first, right? You wouldn't get married to a stranger. You wouldn't buy a car without test-driving it, yeah? So try it temporarily. There's always the possibility that you'll hate it. Or that a month will be enough!


Remember those seasonal camping passes we mentioned? Those are perfect for this. Only instead of de-winterizing the RV, go out there with your tent, your sleeping bag, a jar of peanut butter, and a fishing net. How long can you last? How long can your happiness last? If you love it, come back, stock up for the year, and go back. No harm, no foul.

, You know Napoleon attacked Russia in winter and the Russians were all, ""Good luck with that, buddy?"" Don't be Napoleon. When the weather is nice, stock up. Gather your food (whether it's canned goods or nuts you're burying for winter), gather your firewood, gather your blankets and your snow gear, and ready yourself for the harsher months. When winter does roll around, you can stay in your tent sipping tea from pine needles and reading Emerson.


Also use the summer and fall to practice your skills. You'll need to get decent at setting traps, sharpening knives, hunting and gathering, preserving meat, recognizing plants, first-aid, fire building, and fishing (fly, net, and regular), just to get you started.

, If you're in this for the long haul, there will be times when Mother Nature isn't so nice to you. There will probably be heavy rainfall (or drought), snow, wind, fires, and ice to combat. Be sure you're prepared for anything and everything! Here's a quick list of things you'll need to get you started:


Heavy layers, boots, long underwear, gloves, hats, scarves
Multiple tents and blankets (including a space blanket (extremely reflective Mylar -- good for battling the elements and hypothermia))
Matches, a fire steel (a metal match) tinder and flint, making fire easier to create in cold and wet times
Flashlight, lantern, extra batteries, radio, whistle
First-aid kit, medicines, antiseptic, water-purifying tablets
Tools, rope, knives, cord, waterproof canisters

, This is no joke. Living in the woods is a dangerous situation and many haven't made it out alive. If you plan on doing it for an extended amount of time, what amenities of civilization to you want to hold onto? It's not selling out to have a cup to drink out of, you know. Consider the following:


Camping stove
Dry goods, canned or otherwise (carbs are a good idea)
Cups, silverware, plates, pots, pans
Radio, walkie-talkies
Books and other entertainment

, If you dropped most people into the woods, they'd die in a matter of days. Days might even be generous. But if you read up on what you can use to your advantage when it comes to the local flora and fauna (Birch wood is good for bedding and shelter!), life will be a lot more interesting and a lot easier. And you won't end up munching on those poisonous berries for dinner.


If you think the corporate world is cruel, the woods can be just as terrifying, if not more. There are plants that will make you bust out in hives, there are plants that are only poisonous when raw, there are plants with delicious berries but leaves that give you diarrhea, and that's not even mentioning the trees, soil, and animals. So get to book learning!
""Bushcraft - Outdoor Skills and Wilderness Survival"" by Mors Kochanski is a good place to start. There's also ""How to Live in the Woods"" by Homer Halsted and the entire thing is available online!, With the right licensure, carrying a gun isn't a terrible idea. It could get you out of a sticky situation or two -- but do know that it could also get you into one, too. And did you plan on doing any hunting?


Apart from that, consider investing in bear spray and other devices to ward off dangerous animals. You don't need to tote a gun to defend yourself, but you shouldn't rely on your bare hands either. You probably don't want to strap broken bottles to your knuckles and fight off wolves in the snow, you know?

, If you do yourself one favor, it'll be learning about your area. You want to live near water, you want to live where there isn't a lot of danger (from nosy park rangers or grizzlies, whichever), and you want to know what exactly you have at your disposal. Sure, you could figure it out as you go, but since you have the liberty of picking where you end up, might as well pick the best place.


Be sure to equip yourself with a map and compass. You will get lost. You will wonder where that one cave was. You may even decide you've had enough and decide to do the 10 mile (16 km) trek back to the highway. Who knows? Just have them for when you need them. You know how to use a compass, right?

, This part is ultimately up to you: Do you want to erect a magnificent log cabin or are you more at home in a tent? What can you build that would take advantage of the sun, the trees, not be an eyesore, and withstand the elements? And where is the best place to make your home base?


There are dozens of ways to erect a tent. Before you go about settling for a lean-to, spend a little bit more time on wikiHow. There's a plethora of camping articles you've yet to use to your advantage.

, You're not just camping for a week, spending most of it floating down a river drinking Mike's Hard. You need some serious skills because this is your life 24/7. Here's a very non-exhaustive list of articles you should get to reading! You need to eat, stay warm, and be hygienic above all else, but the entire list is useful.

, When it comes to pooping in the woods (we're just gonna put it out there because you know we're all thinking it), you basically have two options: going about your business wherever and however you like or developing some long-term system. Did you know there's such a thing as a composting toilet where you can use waste to fertilize the ground? If you're there for a while, might as well make the world a better place for it!


While you can go for the traditional ditch latrine, there's also the option of a regular camping toilet. Heck, with all your free time, you could develop a brand new system, too.
And then there's bathing. Hopefully there's a river nearby, right? Aside from having drinking water, it's also good so your own stench doesn't drive you batty. But if for some terrible reason that's not an option, you can make a sweath bath. It's kinda like an outdoors sauna. It'll probably be a trend for city-dwellers in a few years!

, While you may consider having a reprieve from the wilderness life defeating the purpose, it can come in very handy to live ten miles away from a gas station. If you're dying, just really need a real toilet, or would kill the next person you see for a package of beef jerky, it can be a true Godsend. Or if you live semi-near a town, you can go in once every few months for a few staples. There's no harm in it, Your eco-footprint is already marginal compared to the rest of us!


If this is something that intrigues you, you may need a form of transportation. A bicycle makes the most sense, though a motorcycle or moped may also be feasible. Just know that it's one more thing you must know how to maintain. If you do go down this route, familiarize yourself with the mechanics of your vehicle. You should be its master -- not the other way around.

, Since you plan on being here for a while, why not upgrade? Go off the grid and provide yourself your own sustainable energy and way of living. It'll take some money, but do think about installing solar panels in your home (or utilizing wind energy), drilling a well and starting a septic system, using a generator, starting composting, and heck, starting farming!


This is what those communities we mentioned before are doing, but you can definitely do it on your own. You're already going near-green; why not reduce your eco-footprint entirely by providing yourself everything -- literally everything -- you need? Not like you have a 9-to-5 to blame, right? Someone's gotta make up for the rest of us. And imagine how gratifying it would feel to harness your own energy and make all your own food. Holy cow.

, You'll probably want something to do with your time, right? Many off-the-gridders make soaps and lotions, make cloth, blankets, etc. from animal hides, wood carve, make teas and syrups, and master other hobbies that utilize nature. You could even make a little side money, if that interests you. Whether it's for a profit or just for you, having an art is a very good, life-affirming thing.

, Living in the woods is an enormous feat. Even doing it for days is nothing to shake a stick at. It also can cause a person to get inside their own head and drive themselves crazy. You may come to realize that you don't know who you are, what this thing called life is all about, or what really to do with yourself. It might be infinitely more disturbing than you could ever imagine. Or it could be so freeing you don't know why you didn't do it sooner.


Either way, always keep your mental health in mind. People will question your sanity, you may even question your sanity, but if you're happy, continue on. Stay safe, warm, healthy, and strive to live the life you dream of. Whatever it may be.

Otherwise, they will allow passage of air when even they are closed. This means that the heating and cooling appliances in your home will utilize more energy. Therefore, don’t compromise on the quality of doors and windows and save yourself money in the long run.;
, The better your apartment is insulated, the more energy and money you will save. Look for a programmable thermostat, which will keep the living space warm or cool depending on your presence. A programmable thermostat will switch on the cooling and heating appliances only when you are back in your apartment. If you are unsure about which product you should buy, do some research online or enquire in the local electronics shop.

, If you plan on removing entire walls or joining two rooms, see what you can salvage. Using parts that have been removed is a great way to save the environment and your money. You can re-use everything from floorboards to tiles. Instead of throwing them away, give them a twist by adding them to another room or furniture piece.

, VOCs are ‘Volatile Organic Compounds’ that release harmful, volatile compounds into the air, posing long-term health effects. Using VOC-free or low-VOC paints will ensure a healthier environment.

, Using recycled or salvaged wood is a great way to give old material new life, and your apartment a new look. It’s environmentally savvy and gives your home a personality of its own. If you are buying an under-construction apartment, you can ask the developer to use recycled wood and metal in kitchen countertops, window panes, doors, and shelves.

, Using recycled glass is not just helping mother nature, but it’s also helping your apartment look stylish. It is excellent material to use for making countertops and even gives your apartment that icy, cracked atmosphere, which is always elegant.

, A great way to go au natural is to install solar panels while re-doing your apartment. They won’t just save you big bucks on your electricity bill, but will also give your apartment. that sleek, fancy look that everyone admires. When you're residing in an apartment, it might be difficult to install solar panels since you need to seek permission from other residents. However, you can talk to them about the advantage of using solar panels and how it will help them save money. Once you have convinced them, you can ask the builder to install solar panels in the building.

, Bamboo and cork are the perfect replacements for hardwood flooring. Not only are they durable, but they also give your apartment a natural and tranquil appearance. If you’re thinking cork is flimsy, that’s just the ones on wine bottles. The material used for cork flooring is taken from the bark of an oak tree, which can be done without cutting the tree.

, These toilets are low on water-consumption as they offer two flush options. One for dry waste and one for liquid waste. These toilets can help you save upto 80% on your toilet water consumption.

, When you are making your apartment eco friendly, consider installing a rainwater harvesting system. This will help you save water by collecting rainwater from roofs and then storing it in a tank. Tankless water heaters save energy costs by only heating the amount of water that is needed. However,before you install rainwater harvesting systems and tankless water heaters, do seek permission from other residents and the builder or owner.

, There is no use of installing a thermostat or an insulating system if there are tiny holes in your kitchen wall or ceiling. There will still be a loss of energy and this will actually cost you more. So, cover all the holes. Also, fix all leaking taps in your apartment. You may think that there is just a small leakage but that could result in the loss of several litres of water. Therefore, take steps to make your home completely leak-proof.

, Electronic appliance like refrigerators and freezers utilize more energy than you realize. Set your refrigerator at 2.78 degree celsius and the freezer at -19.44 degree celsius to minimize energy consumption. Additionally, remember to shut the refrigerator and freezer door properly. Leaving them open for a long time will result in a tremendous loss of energy.

, Now that you know what area you’re planting in and what plants work best in your locality, you'll need to narrow down which of the suitable plants you like best. Use online or in print books to help you with your search..

At this point, you should already know which plants will work best in terms of your area’s weather, height, depth, sun, and moisture. Now you need to narrow down your choice of plants by their color, smell, and looks.






While it may seem tedious, research is very important when planning a xeriscape garden your and will save you time in the long run.






The following websites allow you to search for your perfect plants using several characteristics: plants.usda.gov, www.garden.org, www.rhs.org.uk







, Key measurements are: Height, length, width and depth.


Height: Measure from the ground to height of any area within the bed you do not want obstructed.







Width and length: Measuring the width and length of your bed will give you an idea of how much space you have to work with while you’re away from your yard. If you can draw this out to scale on paper and take it with you.







Depth: Many people don’t think about the depth of their soil before buying plants, but soil depth will determine what kind of plants do best in your garden. Call 811 ( a federally-mandated national ""call before you dig service"" to find out about any utility lines in your area and make sure it's safe to dig. Then conduct a dig test to find out the soil depth.







, Take some time to analyse the amount of sun your garden receives. This will have a considerable influence on the type of plants you choose.


Full sun: The area in question receives 8-10 hours of sun and is naturally dry.







Partial Sun: The area gets 6-10 hours of direct sun a day.







Partial Shade: This area only receives 2-6 hours of sun







Full shade: This area receives fewer than 2 hours of sun a day.







, The next step is to measure your water levels to figure out how damp or dry the soil is. You can do this by digging down a few inches and feeling the soil under the top layer.

If the soil is still dry you have barren conditions (this may be caused by poor soil or tree roots). If there is wet dirt under the top layer of soil, plants will typically grow in the area, provided that they have deep roots and are drought-tolerant.







Use a rain gauge to find out what the typical rainfall in your area is, so you can choose plants that do best in those conditions. Be sure to watch out for rain gutters and other sources of water that may provide a false reading.







, Armed with lots of information from your personal research, approach your local horticulturist, extension office, or greenhouse with the questions you have about your garden. They’ll appreciate the work you did and you’ll appreciate the expert tailored advice you’ll receive.

Decide where you want to position ground cover plants in your yard.,
Select the kind of ground cover plant you've determined you need or want to add to your landscape.,
Investigate different varieties of ground cover to determine whether you want something colorful, more functional, or both.,
Treat ground covers as you would any other plant when you first establish it.,
Determine how many plants you will need in order to cover the desired area.",How to Choose Ground Cover Plants,"


Stop erosion on hillsides and alongside streams or ditches by planting ground cover where soil tends to wear away. Because of their complex root system, these plants will hold soil in place while providing attractive color and interesting texture to your landscape.
Decide if your ground cover should be spreading or non-spreading. If you want a large area covered, you will want a quick-growing, spreading variety of ground cover.
Plant ground cover plants in areas where grass won't easily grow or where you want to replace grass with something easier to maintain. You won't have to mow and the need to water will be much less.
Use ground cover to define spaces in your garden. Areas of ground cover create pools of interest. Slow-growing ground covers can be used as hedging and add softness to hardscape areas like driveways and sidewalks.;
,


Determine if you want a taller grass-like ground cover, a small shrub, or a low growing ivy.
Consider the area where you are planting the ground cover, whether it gets full sun, partial sun, or daylong shade. Purchase the right variety of ground cover depending upon where it would grow best.

,


Liriope is a grass-like ground cover often used as a border plant. Small white or purple flowers grow from the center in the summer. Mondo grass is another grassy ground cover you might choose.
Ivy plants of many kinds might work best for you as a ground cover. There are many types from which to choose. Since ivy spreads and climbs easily, make sure you can prune it to keep it from becoming invasive.
Some vincas, a low growing ground cover, have green and white leaves which will add interest to your landscape. In addition, some vincas have blue or purple blooms.
Mosses will grow well in deeply shaded places on your property. Different types and colors of moss planted together adds interest and color to an otherwise bleak spot in your landscape.
Pick an evergreen variety of ground cover if you don't want it dying back in the winter. A trailing juniper might be a good choice for an evergreen ground cover.
Fill spaces between stepping stones with low growing ground covers. Choose a sedum or a dwarf mondo grass. Herbs such as thyme make good ground covers to use between steps or along pathways. They also add fragrance each time you step.

, Clear the area where you want to plant the ground cover of any weeds and other plants you no longer want in the area. Be sure the soil is healthy and add mulch to keep the plants from drying out.

, Speak to someone at your local garden center or plant nursery if you have questions.

Knowing the purpose of your pergola should help you figure out how much shade and privacy you’ll need. Use this information to determine which structure and location will be best for you.Attached pergolas can be attached to your house and used as small porches or to your deck to provide an area to entertain guests at a barbecue.
Small freestanding pergolas can be placed in a garden and used like a trellis to grow vines upon. Larger freestanding pergolas can be used like gazebos.
Pick a shady location to put your pergola if you’re using it to cover a dining area or hot tub.;
, Go online and look into permit requirements and local building laws before you buy your pergola. Depending on your area, there may be restrictions on where and how you can build your pergola legally. You may find that you have to obtain a construction permit in order to install your pergola.


Living in a bushfire-prone area, for example, may significantly limit your material options., Once you’ve decided on your pergola’s purpose, as well as whether or not you intend to grow climbing plants on it, you’ll need to think about how close together your rafters should be. More rafters set tighter together at perpendicular angles provide more shade, but less space for vegetation to grow into.


A latticed roof is the best, most cost-efficient option if you want to maximize shade and privacy under your pergola.

, As pergolas are rectangular structures, you need to define the length and width of the pergola you want, whether you decide to get a freestanding or attached one.


Factor in the size of your yard. It might look silly or odd to have a tiny pergola in a giant yard or a huge pergola in a small space.
If you’re putting your pergola on an existing patio, measure the length and width of the patio’s surface., It’s very important that your pergola is secure. You can either secure the pergola posts on a concrete slab or by sticking them into the ground. When deciding this, it’s best to keep in mind what you’d like to use the pergola for.


If you plan to secure the posts by putting them into the ground, make sure that you purchase a pergola with posts that stand slightly taller than you want., Choose to get a pergola made of wood if you want to enhance the natural environment. Wood is always a safe choice for any outdoor setting, because it easily fits in.A cedar pergola will repel insects, repel water, give off a nice aroma, and resist decay.
Redwood pergolas are desirable because of their strength and attractive appearance.
If you’ve got a higher budget, go with pressure treated oak, fir, pine, or bamboo.

, Depending on the type of metal you choose, metal pergolas can accentuate a variety of styles, including both traditional and more modern. Go with either wrought iron, aluminum, or steel.


Wrought iron pergolas are typically both the most expensive and most ornate choice.
Choose steel if you want your pergola to stand strong for a long period of time.
Aluminum pergolas are popular because they’re inexpensive, sturdy, and lightweight., In recent years, vinyl has become a more popular material choice. Vinyl is cheaper, more lightweight, and easier to clean than the other options. You would only have to spray down a vinyl pergola with a garden hose from time to time to keep it looking good, and you won’t have to worry about any cracks forming.


Most vinyl pergolas are white, but you can also find them in gray, tan, and other colors., If you’re wanting to add a “wow” factor to your yard, consider getting a Tuscan style pergola. Its large, round pillars and stone material leave a lavish impression on guests.The stone material makes this style an expensive option, so if you’re working with a small budget, consider getting a Tuscan style that uses materials other than the traditional stone.

, If you already have a koi pond or a small asian-inspired garden, then a Japanese style pergola would be a great choice. This style is characterized by its wooden beams that curve upward, similar to many other pieces of Japanese architecture., Go for an Amish pergola if you appreciate one-of-a-kind quality woodwork. If you get this style, your pergola will have a distinct grain and coloration unlike any other, and will provide a quaint addition to your yard., Arched pergolas are both stylish and functional. If you want a bigger pergola used as both an impressive focal point and for functional coverage, this may be the best option., Especially if you’re wanting a specific, unique pergola that you can’t just assemble with a kit, you’ll need to make a note of each and every detail. Decide on the size of the corner posts, the size of the lattices, and how much the pergola's roof should overhang the corner posts.


This is especially necessary if you’re wanting a very large, very small, or uniquely shaped (round or triangular) pergola.Keep in mind that customization prices add up quickly.

, Pergola kits include all the materials you'll need to assemble your pergola in a short time. The posts and latticework are usually already pre-cut to the lengths you need and notched for quick assembly. You will pay more, however, for this convenience, and you will need to have the tools necessary to assemble it.


This option will save you a little bit of money because you won’t have to pay for labor.
If you already have the tools and experience necessary to completely construct the pergola yourself, you can instead build the pergola from scratch., You can custom-design a pergola using an online retailer's web-based design tools. You'll be asked about the architecture of your home and offered options to design a pergola that fits with the architecture. Depending on the options you choose, a custom-design pergola can cost about the same as a prefabricated kit or significantly more than one., Lighting, ceiling fans, and awnings can all add to a pergola's attractiveness and usefulness. However, these accessories each come with an extra cost. Some accessories require supporting materials, such as solar panels or electric wiring, that may impact where you can place your pergola or how it should be designed in order to accommodate them.


If you plan on using your pergola to entertain guests at night, add in a lighting feature to enhance the ambiance."

Figure out all of your guaranteed monthly income, and how much it adds up to.,
Track your expenses each month with receipts or online apps.,
Break your expenses down into fixed, essential, and non-essential to make sense of what you absolutely must buy.,
Determine how much free money you have by subtracting expenses from income.,
Split the rest of your money into broad categories to help you spend wisely.,
Repeat this record keeping every month to find potential issues or savings before they surprise you.","How to Live on a Income Under $20,000.00 a Year1"," Successfully living on a limited income is all about making the most of everything you've got. So you need to know what exactly you have available. You only want to add up the income that you know, without any doubt, that you will be receiving each month. While you get overtime, tips, or bonuses, don't account for them here -- if they all turned up empty, you need to know that you can live on your guaranteed income alone.


Write this number down as ""monthly income."";
, Keep all of your receipts to get an accurate picture of your spending habits. Luckily, modern technology has made this easier than ever, as you can log-in online to see you bank and credit card activity. Most banks even break this up by type of spending as well, such as ""Food/Groceries,"" ""Gas,"" or ""Rent."" Apps like Mint, Mvelopes, and HomeBudget, sync with your financial accounts and provide graphs of your spending each week.If you spend cash, keep the receipt and make a note of what you bought.
Write this number down as ""monthly expenses""

, Some things, like rent, are due every month no matter what. There are some expenses, like food, that change a bit but cannot be cut much shorter. But there are other expenses that, with hindsight, you realize you didn't need to spend. Putting your expenses into these categories helps you analyze places to save money. If you can, average the expenses from a few months to get a more accurate number.



Fixed Expenses: Do not change month to month, but are due every single month. Including rent, car/loan payments, etc.

Essential Expenses: These can't be avoided -- food, transportation, utilities -- but can potentially be cut down through careful budgeting and saving.

Non-Essential Expenses: This is your entertainment, fun, and everything else fund. More often than not this is where you will be able to save the most money.

, This is the amount of leftover money you have. Add back in the money from ""Non-Essential Expenses"" to determine the amount of money you have left after essential bills are paid. Now you know exactly how much free money you can spend every month and still live and pay rent.

, Once you know your expenses and your income, you know how much money you should have left for entertainment, debts, and savings. Figure out what you plan to spend on each category now to see how feasible it each month will be.



Entertainment: Everyone deserves to have fun, no matter how much money they make. Having low income doesn't mean you don't get to enjoy yourself. However, you need to be careful about spending your limited income. Having an ""entertainment budget"" will help.

Debt and Loan Payments: Debt adds up quickly, and the faster you pay it off the more money you ultimately save. You should always have an eye on paying off debt with spare money. Whenever possible, pay more than the ""minimum payment."" to avoid growing interest

Savings Accounts: Even low-income workers need to save -- as it is an essential safeguard in case of an emergency like a layoff or injury. You want at least three months of expenses covered, if not six., The enemies of a good personal budget are surprises. You cannot do this once and get a perfect budget, and you may find that you can spend or save more than you thought with practice. When you are living on a limited income, you need to keep an eye on your money regularly.


At the end of the month, compare how you did in reality to how you planned in your budget. Find the places where there were differences and think about how you can fix it.

Making lists of priorities, essentials, and goals will help you keep your head on straight when shopping, allowing you to make the most of every dollar. Remember -- every time you buy something you should ask, ""do I need this? will this significantly increase my quality of life a week or month from now?"" If you come into each store with a plan you can avoid impulse buys or indecision.

Use a hoe to weed and groom the soil around shallow rooted plants.,
Look for a cultivator that has anywhere from one to five pointed tines.,
Patrol your garden with a weeder.,
Do your 'sit down' weeding with a hand cultivator.,
Get a gardening trowel that has just the right “feel” to it because you will use it constantly.,
Keep a landscaping rake on hand for leveling seedbeds and other landscaped areas.,
Trim your plants and shrubs with pruning shears.,
Use scissor shears for cleaning up or shaping ground covers and around the base of shrubs or trees.

",How to Care for Landscape Plants2," Hoes can also be used to chop off annual weeds (perennial weeds must be dug out and removed) and other plants at ground level. A weeding hoe has a short handle and a two-sided tool head. One side of the tool head is narrow and the other side has 2 or 3 tines.

, Cultivators are used in a chopping and pulling motion to remove shallow rooted weeds, and to break up surface soil crust around plants.


It is convenient to have both a long-handled and a short-handled cultivator so that you can easily reach all your plants.

, Weeders look like wide screwdrivers, except they have a notch on one end. This long narrow design allows you to dig down the side of the taproot of dandelions and other deep rooted weeds.

, Hand cultivators allow you to dig down and remove the tap roots of perennial weeds without needing to strain your back by bending over repeatedly.

, Gardening trowels look like miniature shovels and are invaluable, especially during planting season. Drop shank trowels are for general gardening use. Straight shank trowels are for planting bulbs.

, Landscaping rakes are similar to steel garden rakes, except that they are wider and the back of the rake head is straight and even.

, They are a must item you will need to care for your landscaping plants.

Water new transplants until they become established and if weekly rainfall is inadequate.,
Give your flowers an average of 1” of water a week.,
Deep water your trees and large shrubs once every month.",How to Care for Landscape Plants3,"


If you have sandy soil that is unable to hold much water in reserve for your plants, you’ll need to water more often than if you have loamy soil that can hold plenty of moisture.
Your flowers will communicate their watering needs to you. All flowers will wilt if they receive either too little or too much water. Your flowers will most probably wilt a bit in the mid-day sun, but that is to be expected and is only temporary. Flowers wilting after the heat of the day has subsided indicates that there is a serious water shortage.
If you are not sure your flowers are wilting because they need water, you can check the soil by digging down a few inches and feeling it. If the soil is still moist several inches below the surface, you don’t need to water.

, Keep a rain gauge to track the rainfall and then water your flowers more if they need it.

, Turn your hose on low, so that there is little more than a trickle of water coming out, and place the hose near the plant. Let the water drip into the soil for several hours so that the water reaches the deep roots of your larger trees and shrubs.

Inspect your flower beds daily for weeds and remove the weeds as soon as possible.,
Avoid letting any weed go to seed.",How to Care for Landscape Plants4,"


Most freshly sprouted weeds can be hand-pulled.
Tough weeds, such as Dandelions, will require your weeding tool or any long, narrow garden tool you have on hand.
If you don’t dig out the entire Dandelion root, it will quickly grow back, so dig deep and get it all out at once.

, Even weeds with an annual life-cycle can produce thousands of seeds in one season. The wind will scatter the seeds all over your property and create countless hours of work for you.


If you don’t have time to dig out a weed that is on the brink of going to seed, at least pull the top of it off and dispose of it.
For Dandelion and other wispy, delicate seeds, use one hand to slip a paper bag over the top of the seed head and snap the plant stem with your other hand, keeping the seed head inside the bag so the wind doesn’t scatter the seeds.

",How to Build Fake Rock with Cement2,",, Use rocks you have in your yard. Clean the rock first, then place it where you can work with it. Using contractors foam sealant, coat the rock with a heavy layer. Let dry and gently pry the foam mold off the rock. You can also use the same method but place the rock in a box. Place the rock inside the box, spray interior with foam sealant and allow it to dry, then tear the box away from the foam. Don't go crazy on the foam.

, However, to keep it from sticking, you may want to use cooking spray before pouring the cement. Another good method is to rub the rock with Vaseline.

, You can add color to the concrete at this point by mixing colors that can be purchased at Home Depot or Lowes. You can also use the red dirt from your yard to mix into the cement for color; it works, but you have to watch that you don't add too much - just enough to give it some color.

, If you use a mold, you may not be able to sculpt the ""rock."" However, if you take the rock out of the mold before it's completely dry, you can still scrape it to sculpt the shape a little.

, Before pouring cement into the mold, you can add leaves, small flat rocks and other paraphernalia from around your yard to give the ""rock"" character. Pouring flat rocks or flagstone type rocks can also be accomplished and put in crushed glass or other interesting items before the pour. Then when you turn it out, the pretty stuff will be on top.

Give yourself a savings goal, something to strive for instead of spending money.,
Try to live in a lower-cost area or city.,
Cut down on addictive and needless habits like smoking, coffee, and sweets.,
Use credit cards very sparingly, making sure you can pay off in full each month.,
Take cash out from the bank, separating it into envelopes for each expense if you struggle to budget.,
Ensure you have 3-6 months living expenses saved at all times.","How to Live on a Income Under $20,000.00 a Year3"," Why are you living on $20,000 or less, and how do you want to change things? Maybe you want to go on vacation, buy a car, move to a new city, save for school, etc. If you have a tangible reason to save money, it will be much easier not to blow it on a new video game. Give yourself an exciting financial goal and saving will be much more doable no matter what your budget is., Living off of $20,000 a year or less is very hard in NYC or San Francisco, though not impossible. Your dollars go a lot further in smaller towns, rural areas, and inland cities. While your salary or income might not be changing, you can change it's relative value by moving to a city where everything costs less.


Search online for ""Cost of Living Comparisons,"" which provide up-to-date information on prices across the country.
Aim for rent to be no higher than $600, and much less when possible. This is a good financial cap for a $20,000 a year job., Spending just $3 on coffee every day quickly adds up to $90 a month, or at least 5% of your total yearly income. Cigarettes will get even more expensive. At the end of the day, saving money and budgeting requires sacrifices -- you should find a way to cut out these needless expenses.


Even cutting these habits in half can make a big difference, and is a great starting point.
Find alternative, cheaper habits whenever possible. Whenever you get an urge (smoking), fill in your new habit (taking a walk around the block) as a replacement., Credit cards aren't free-- they come with interest rates that will gouge your paycheck if you let them run rampant. Managing your money wisely means using your credit cards wisely-- as extensions of your well-planned budget. Some things to remember:



Know your rates and how they can change. If confused, call your bank and make sure you understand your terms and interest.
Pay more than the monthly minimum whenever possible, as this decreases later interest payments.
Stay within 30-40% of your credit card limit. You never want to be reaching your limit, as the interest will become exponentially worse. Staying at our below 20% is a good benchmark for cautious spenders., A debit card can be dangerous -- you keep spending without seeing the money leave. If you struggle to hit a budget, take all the expense money out at the beginning of the month and put it into envelopes -- food, gas, rent, utilities, fun, etc. This ensures you only spend the money where it was meant to be spent., Many financial advisers even suggest going further, saving for at least 9-12 months, but 3 is the bare minimum. You need to be financially prepared in case of emergencies. Remember, also, that this money should only be spent in emergencies.


Multiply your monthly essential & fixed expenses by 3 or 6 months to get a good number for savings.

Finished.",How to Build Outdoor Fireplaces," Reasons for building an outdoor hearth vary, but whatever yours are, you will want to consider certain elements to bring your project to a successful conclusion.


Ambience: Fireplaces can set the mood. A cozy open hearth provides an intimate setting for small groups. If you throw large parties, consider building a fireplace with two open ends to accommodate more people. A fire pit provides views from all vantage points and the feel of a campfire setting.
Functionality: You can build a fireplace that also serves as a barbecue or pizza oven, but these designs are very complex. Also consider any electrical installations you may need to hide behind the fireplace, including lighting or audio/visual cables.;
, Many homeowners match the stonework of their fireplace to the stonework of their residence, although it's not mandatory. Brick offers a more traditional stone façade, while man-made stacked stone gives the hearth more of a contemporary look.If you don't want to go for a stone exterior, stucco is also a popular option.

, The size of your fireplace should be scaled to its surroundings. Consider whether you want your fireplace to be the focal point of your back yard, or to complement an already-stunning vista.


Try to design the fireplace with proportions in mind. You don't want your fireplace to completely overshadow the size of your house; nor do you want the fireplace to be dwarfed by your home.
Locate the fireplace in its own space to create another ""room"" in your outdoor living space. Allow plenty of space in front of it for family and friends to gather around and enjoy.

, Most outdoor fireplaces are either wood-burning or gas. A wood-burning fireplace offers the attraction of a more ""natural"" fire. However, they usually require a building permit. Contact your municipal government about setback restrictions, chimney specifications, and other requirements. The city will issue a permit to allow you to begin construction, then inspect the result and grant permission for you to use it.

, Gas fireplaces burn cooler but cleaner than their wood-burning counterparts, with little if any ash, embers, and smoke. Hire your gas supplier or a licensed gas contractor to safely connect the fireplace to your gas line.


Check local codes for specifications on gas piping. Many areas require black iron pipes rather than regular steel or galvanized materials.

, Fireplace kits really run the gamut, ranging from simple affairs to ornate pieces, replete with all the bells and whistles. The great thing about fireplace kits is that you can usually opt for a wide variety of styles that will fit your budget. Got a smaller budget? No problem, there's a kit for that. Working with a bigger budget? The sky is almost literally the limit.

, If you're an experienced home builder, you don't need to limit yourself to a kit. It's still best to stick to a proven build, but you can start with plans you find online and make small alterations. Most DIY designs employ cinder blocks or another sturdy, economical material as the skeleton. The skeleton is then covered with stone or another veneer stone after the cinder block is laid. Consider the three main elements of your outdoor fireplace when choosing a design:


Base: A reinforced concrete base is the best base you can have for a fireplace. Custom fireplaces are usually heavier than prefab fireplaces, meaning your base needs to be stronger and thicker than ordinary.Firebox: Your firebox will house the fire, and should sport fire brick if custom built. On the other hand, you can purchase a firebox (choices of material include stainless steel and other types of brick) if you don't want to build it yourself.
Chimney or Vents: A wood-burning fireplace will require a chimney with a spark arrestor, while a gas-lit fireplace will only require vents.

, Your fireplace doesn't merely need to be a hearth. In fact, if you're building an outdoor fireplace, it makes sense to outfit it with other uses or aesthetic furnishings. Consider:


Built-in seating. Warming yourself by the heat of the hearth is a real treat, so why not build seat walls as an extension of the fireplace itself? It looks wonderful and adds instant charm to any outdoor fireplace.
Wood storage. Convenient if you're building a wood-burning fireplace, a compartment or space for wood will make stoking the fire easy and painless.

, Set up the foundation first by digging a trench and using a plate compactor to shore up the foundation. Mix and pour the cement and allow it to set for at least 24 hours, if not longer.


Check with local building authorities to see how low you'll need to dig your foundation. Some locations will need foundations of concrete only 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep, while others will need to be in excess of 1 foot (0.3 m).
Note: Concrete and mortar, although similar, are different bonding agents and should be used differently. You'll use the concrete to lay a foundation, if necessary, and the mortar in order to bond concrete or cinder blocks together.

, Follow the building plans precisely, making sure that each row of blocks is level.


When creating the base, be sure to use a level in order to ensure a balanced placement of the concrete or cinder blocks.
If building using cinder blocks, spread mortar in between each row, as well as in between individual pieces of cinder block.

, Fire brick should take special care when installed inside a firebox: Laying a pleasing-looking pattern and mixing the right mortar is an important consideration.


Choose a nice inlay pattern with which to set the fire brick. A running bond pattern works nicely in a firebox. Find the center of the firebox and trace a line all the way to the face of the firebox.
Place a fire brick immediately to the left and to the right of the bisecting line, flush against the face of the firebox, leaving about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) space in between the two. Lay one brick immediately above the two bricks, offsetting it by placing it exactly in the middle. Above it, lay down two bricks in the same pattern as originally placed.
Mix your mortar with high-temperature mortar. This way, the high temperature of the fire won't compromise the mortar that's holding the fire brick together.
When laying down the brick, cut it as necessary at corners and edges. While you should be able to get by without having to cut the center pieces of the firebox, corners and edges will force you to the fire brick down to size.

, Pack in the mortar in each seam with a jointer. Then, dust away any excess mortar with a clean brush, leaving your firebox to dry to at least 24 hours.

, The chimney must be built to exact specifications to ensure proper draw of the smoke from the firebox. It must have a smoke shelf to reduce down-draft and a flue of optimum dimensions. It's best to follow local building codes, but you can start with these typical standards:


Measure the width and height of the fireplace opening to get its area.
If the chimney is under 15 ft (4.6 m) tall, make its cross section 1/8 the area of the fireplace opening.
If the chimney is over 15 ft (4.6 m) tall, make its cross section 1/10 the area of the fireplace opening instead.
The chimney must also be at least 2 feet (0.609 m) higher than any adjacent structures, and 10 ft (3 m) away.

, Like chimneys, spark arrestors are exclusive to wood-burning fireplaces. They trap embers from the hearth.

, The hearthstone is the lip of your fireplace opening, perhaps the focal point of your outdoor fireplace. This should be at least 10 ft (3 m) away from all other structures and from any overhanging objects such as patio roofs and pergolas. Installing it correctly is an important part of building an outdoor fireplace:


Choose a hearthstone made from completely fireproof materials, at least 4 inches (10 cm) thick. It should extend at least 16 inches (41 cm) in front of the firebox and 8 inches (20 cm) on either side. If the firebox opening is larger than 6 square ft. (0.56 m2), extend the hearthstone to at least 20 inches (51 cm) in front and at least 12 inches (30 cm) on either side.
Place mortar in three 3/4-inch (19 mm) deep strips, 1 inch (2.5 cm) from each other.
Set down the hearthstone, using a rubber mallet and level to make sure that it's plumb and level. If the hearthstone isn't flush with the firebox, that's okay. This will make it harder for any sparks to fly out of the front of the firebox.

, Apply mortar to the back of the stones and stick them onto the cinder blocks. Use spacers to separate stones, filling in the area between them with mortar.


At perfect 90 degree corners, avoid continuous joints that travel all the way down the length of the fireplace. Instead, tooth them. Place the first stone flush on a corner, and then bring another stone out an inch or so to meet it. With the next two stones, alternate the joint: Bring the first stone out, and then place the second stone flush on the wall. This creates an attractive-looking alternating pattern running down the corners of the fireplace.
Once laid, allow the mortar at least 24 hours to harden. If possible, give the fireplace several days of rest before attempting to use.

, If building a gas-burning fireplace, prepare to hook up gas to your fireplace in order to get it working.


Turn off the gas.
Use plumber's putty on the threads of the main line to connect it to the flexible lines.
Tighten the connection with a wrench until the fitting seats. Test the connection by spreading dishwashing soap on it.
Turn on the gas. If bubbles appear, refit the connection.

, You've successfully added value to your home, revitalizing your backyard. Enjoy your new outdoor fireplace!

,How to Build a Greenhouse,
"
Create your plan or design including the following information: what the steps are going to look like and what materials are going to be used.,
Mark on the wall where the bottom of your steps will be and excavate (dig out) ten inches below the mark.

,
Line the bottom of the hole.,
Fill the hole with GA four inches deep, then compact it with a vibrating plate (repeat this process until you reach a reach about a half inch below the mark on the wall).

,
Once you have compacted your last lift of GA, check it with a level to make sure you don’t have any high spots and if you do simply scratch out the extra GA with a rake.

,
Using spray paint, mark out the outside of the first step and the base layer for the side wall.

,
Cover the painted line with several shovelfuls of stone dust (finely crushed rock).

,
Smooth out the area where the mark on the wall is located to expose the mark.

,
Stand in the middle, place your level with one end on the front of the mark end the other end parallel with the painted line (leaving your six inches of over base) and pull it towards you, watching the bubbles and keeping it level (make a pad of dust twenty inch’s wide).

,
Repeat this process working off of your last level mark each time until you reach the wall on the other side (pull all extra stone dust to the inside as it will be used for fill).

,
Place the bricks on the ground where you planned for the first step and break the end of the end bricks in the row to give it a natural look.

,
Place the rest of the bricks from the end of the front row in to the wall (make your cut at the wall end).

,
Start on the second layer.,Once the glue has set for a least half an hour, fill in the middle with GA using the same four inch lifts that you did earlier

,
When you are within half and inch of the top, make a twenty pad where the next step will go and use level to make a flat pad by dragging it across the sides.

,
Lay your base coarse directly behind the first step and build up the sides using the same technique as before.

,
Put on your second layer, glue it and repeat these last steps until you reach three and a half inch’s from the top (the height of the cap which is the decorative stone that is placed on top of each step).

,
Cover each step with cap, glue it, allow it to dry for at least twelve hours, and you're finished.

",How to Build Interlock Stairs,";
,, Once you have reached the desired depth (this can be measured by placing the end of a level of the mark, holding it level across the hole and using a measuring tape to measure for the level down to bottom of the hole), line the bottom of your hole with poly or plastic sheeting to prevent the soil from contaminating the GA ( granular aggregate or gravel).

,,,,,,,,,, Now that you have finished your base course or buried course (it is called this because this brick will be hidden by the other brink to insure stability and to meet building codes for step sizes) put a second layer on the wall (makes sure that you do your best to bridge the joints, interlock your corners, and glue the second layer to your base).

Decide what type of ""storm"" and/or ""wind rating"" you are building a shelter for.,
Find out if the area you intend to install this 'tornado or hurricane' shelter is in a ""flood zone"" or ""storm surge zone."",
Once you have found it safe to install an in-ground type model, the following is helpful.

,
For hurricane shelters measure a space large enough to provide about 10 square feet of space for each person who will use the shelter, plus room for supplies.,
Excavate a hole larger than the size of the room to allow space to build walls and install a door.,
Pour a concrete foundation 5 inches (12.7 cm) thick.,
Built a dome-shaped frame using wood, fiberglass or steel, depending on the severity of the storms you area tends to experience.,
Pour concrete over the frame.,
Install a steel door frame and door with three deadbolt latches.,
Cover the roof with waterproof membrane and add masonry or other material to help it blend into the surroundings in an attractive way.

,
Finish the interior, if desired, to make the shelter more cozy.

,
Install sturdy shelves to organize supplies and maximize floor space.",How to Build a Storm Shelter," Tornado is an ""EF"" rating of 1-5. Hurricane is similar. This will help you decide on how strong your shelter should be built.;
, This will help you decide on an ""in-ground"" or ""above ground"" model.

,, Tornado shelters only require 3-5 square foot of space per occupant.

, A berm shelter is not completely underground, which allows you access to the door without building a full set of stairs.

, Allow it to cure completely.

, Line the frame with waterproof membrane and reinforce it with a wire mesh. Use anchors to attach the frame to the foundation.

, Reinforce the roof with additional layers of wire mesh to strengthen it, making it thick enough to withstand 200 pounds of force so it doesn't get torn off by high winds.

, Make sure the hinges are on the outside of the frame.

,,, Put in benches or other seating and consider ways to make sleeping on the shelter floor more comfortable.

Decide what type of shovel you want.,
Select the correct shape of shovel for the work you wish to do:


For general-purpose digging of holes in soil, a round nose (somewhat pointed) shovel with a blade (metal part) 8-12"" long and 6-8"" wide is ideal.,
Find a shovel with the blade you want, and verify that it's handle is good:


Is the handle long enough that you can effectively use the tool without bending over?,
Is the blade strong?,
Actually buy the shovel.

",How to Buy and Maintain a Shovel1," Do you want a shovel to remove snow? Dig holes? Move grain?;
, Rolled edges that you can push on with your feet are a plus.
For heavy or rocky soils, you may wish to get a companion shovel for the above, basically to loosen up the soil so that you can move it with the larger shovel: a thick, heavy blade 8-12"" long by about 4"" wide is well suited for this task.
For moving light, granular goods, such as grain, a fairly large and well-scooped shovel is best.
For shoveling snow off of driveways, a large shovel with a flat nose is best. The size should be determined by how thick of a layer of snow you are moving: thicker snow means narrower shovel.

, Short handles tend to lead to inefficient shoveling.
Is the handle the correct thickness for your hands? Too thick will tend to give you blisters, too thin will be hard to hold on to.
Is the handle attached to the blade in a robust manner? Is it likely to break off under torsional (twisting) loads?
Is the handle robust? Will it end up breaking?

, Plastic blades, even as snow shovels, tend to end up chipping and breaking with time.


Is the blade suitably thick? Will it be damaged if it hits something, like a rock, while digging?
In the case of a shovel for soil, is the blade's steel of good quality? With permission, test this by filing the edge of the shovel a bit: soft steel with file easily. If in doubt, just don't buy the cheap shovels.

Build sod houses in September, when the roots of the grass are deepest.,
Find a location that's fairly level in an area that's covered with thick prairie grass, such as buffalo grass.,
Dig up the sod inside the marked area, rake the dirt until it's smooth and level and tamp it down as much as you can.,
Mow the grass to a height of 4 inches.

,
Slice the sod into 2-foot (61 cm) strips.,
Cut the strips across at 1-foot (30 cm) intervals.,
Lay 1 row of bricks on the ground, grass-side down.,
Lay the second row of sod bricks on top the first.,
Add subsequent rows of bricks over the first rows.,
Lay sod brick until your walls reach the bottom of where you want your windows.,
Continue building the walls around the window and door frames.,
Construct a roof for your sod house.,
Cover the roof with sod.,
Install the doors and windows.

,
Suspend a muslin sheet to the roof inside the house to form a sort of ceiling that will catch any dirt or water that falls from the roof.

,
Fill any spaces remaining in the walls with additional sod or grass.

,
Smooth the inside of the walls and whitewash them.",How to Build a Sod House," The roots hold the sod bricks together during construction.;
, Mark the area where you will build the house so you will know where to place the exterior walls. Leave a space for the door.

, This creates the floor of the house.

,, Cut down to a depth of 4 inches.

, This creates uniform bricks of sod which you can then remove and stack near where you will build the house.

, Follow the markers for the exterior walls.

, Place the center of the second-row bricks directly over where two first-row bricks meet. You must cut some bricks in half to fit the corners.

, Stagger the bricks so the ends of the bricks on the row below are directly under the centers of the bricks on top. Every few rows, lay the bricks crosswise to the row underneath to help make the walls more sturdy.

, Place the frames for the windows on the walls and the door frame in the space you left for the door.

, Leave room between the bricks and the frames and stuff the spaces with grass. If you pack too closely, the sod may settle and cause the frames to shift or the window glass to break.

, Several styles of roof were used on sod houses, ranging from flat roofs made from a lattice of tree branches, to traditional gabled roofs made from lumber, tar paper and shingles. A quality roof can protect a sod house for many years with little need for maintenance.

, Place the grass-side up to protect against erosion.

,,,, You may also choose to cover the outside of the walls with stucco to protect them from the weather.

Use 2 2-by-4's of 10 feet (3.05 m) in length to form the length of the frame, which will be rectangular.
Measure and cut 2 69 inch (175.3 cm) 2-by-4's to form the width of the frame.
Put the shorter boards at a right angle inside the longer boards. Taking into account the standard thickness of a 2-by-4 (1.5 inches or 3.8 cm), the total depth of the frame will be 72 inches (6 feet or 182.9 cm).
Nail the 2-by-4's together with 16d nails;
,

Cut 5 more 69 inch (175.3 cm) boards.
Measure the 10 foot (3.04 m) sides of the frame, marking off sections in 20 inch (50.8 cm) intervals.
Nail the 69 inch (175.3 cm) boards inside the rectangular frame at each point you marked.
Measure the frame along its depth. Mark points with a pencil at 15 inches (38.1 cm), 30 inches (76.2 cm), and 45 inches (116.8 cm).

, The risers will be staggered heights to accommodate alternating seating and foot-rest sections. Cut 14 2-by-4's at these heights: 12 inches (30.5 cm), 18 inches (45.7 cm), 24 inches (61 cm), 30 inches (76.2 cm), and 42 inches (106 cm).,

Nail 2 of the 18 inch (45.7 cm) boards into the frame starting at the front of the frame at the left-hand corner. Nail the rest of the 18 inch (45.7 cm) boards, in pairs, into the front of the frame where it joins the 69 inch (175.3 cm) boards (every 20 inches or 50.8 cm). This group of risers will serve as the supports for the first row of seating. Repeat the process with the other board lengths at the corresponding points.
At the 15 inch (63.6 cm) mark along the width of the frame, secure 2 12 inch (30.5 cm) boards at the frame's edge. Moving left to right, nail the rest of the 12 inch (30.5 cm) boards, in pairs, into the frame at the proper coordinates.
Attach the 30 inch (76.2 cm) risers at the 30 inch (76.2 cm) mark. Remember to secure to 2 at a time along the width of the frame.
Secure the 24 inch (61 cm) risers across the width of the frame at the 45 inch (116.8 cm) mark.
Nail the 42 inch (106 cm) risers into the back edge of the frame. This group provides the support for the third row of seating.

,

Measure drill points in each of the 5 12 foot (3.66 m) 2-by-4's you will be using.
Mark 2 drill points for each riser, each 1 inch (2.54 cm) in from the edge of the board. The boards will hang 1 foot (30.5 cm) over each side of the frame, so the first measurement for drilling should be 1 foot (30.5 cm) in from the edge.
Mark the next measurement at the 32 inch (81.3 cm) mark. The subsequent drill marks would come at 20 inch (50.8 cm) intervals, corresponding with the risers that support the board.

, Screw the boards into the risers using a power drill and deck screws., Use a power sander with 100-grit paper over the large surfaces. Sand edges by hand. Make sure all surfaces are smooth to reduce the chance of people getting splinters., Select a hardwood stain to protect the wood. Start staining the edges and corners of the wood, using a small brush. Use a larger brush for flat sections, applying the stain evenly., Apply a matte seal to the wood to waterproof it. Use the same brush technique as you did with the stain."

Waterproof the concrete.",How to Clean Mold Off Concrete," You can use a mold-killing detergent, diluted bleach, or a commercial cleaner made specifically for killing mold.Don’t mix anything other than water with bleach, as certain cleaning agents can produce highly toxic fumes when mixed with bleach.For a diluted bleach solution, mix three parts water with one part bleach in a bucket.Don’t forget to test a small, discreet area first. Bleach and other chemicals can discolor concrete that’s been colored or stained.;
, Any organic material adjacent to the moldy area can be infected. Throw away any disposables like cardboard boxes. Set aside other removable items like furniture or area rugs.

, Use a heavy duty sponge or scrub brush to apply your chosen cleaning solution to all visible moldy areas on the concrete. Scrub the areas vigorously. If you’re using mold-killing detergent, apply it directly to the spots and scrub it with a bristle brush.Don’t use a wire brush, which can scratch concrete.Wear old clothes, rubber gloves, safety goggles and a respirator or dust mask.

, If the spots aren’t lifting, leave the solution to sit for several minutes. Then scrub the areas with the solution until the mold is gone., Use a hot water pressure washer for the fastest and most effective rinse. Wear safety goggles, sturdy footwear and long pants. Use a pressure rating of at least 3000 psi with a flow rate of at least four gpm (gallons per minute).This should lift any organic matter that has seeped into the pores of the concrete.If you don’t want to use a pressure washer, try a regular water hose.You can rent a pressure washer at a home or building supply store. You may need a van, pickup truck or SUV to transport it, and a friend to help load and unload it.Ask the rental agent how to use the washer and to give you any safety precautions. Find out if the washer comes with nozzles. Don’t use settings finer than fifteen degrees. Never use a zero degree nozzle on a pressure washer.

, Once it’s dry, inspect carefully for any mold that may not have been cleaned. If there is still visible mold, rinse the area clean and try one of the stronger methods you haven’t used yet: diluted bleach or commercial cleaner., Leather, wood or inorganic furniture can be deep cleaned. Upholstered furniture with visible mold will need to be disposed of or reupholstered by a professional. Carpet that shows significant mold growth or is soaked completely through will need to be removed.

, Dirt should be slightly sloped away from the house so that water will travel away from the perimeter rather than pool up against the outer walls. Don’t allow wet leaves or other debris to pile up against the exterior walls of your home.Pooling water can seep into the home and cause mold to grow inside the house.
If your driveway is showing signs of mold, consider removing trees or shrubbery that are blocking sunlight on your driveway. Mold thrives in damp and shady areas., Sump pumps should discharge water at least twenty feet from your home. Your gutters should expel water at least six feet away from the exterior walls. If your gutters are releasing water too close to the home, install gutter extenders., Make sure none of your outside hose spots are dripping. Examine the perimeter of the building for any potential water dripping or seepage.

, If there are any leaks – for example in your piping or roof – repair them. Insulate your roof, exterior walls, windows and pipes to cut down on moisture that forms condensation., If your mold problem is indoors, increase the ventilation to prevent warm and stagnant air where mold can thrive. Make sure large appliances are vented, such as your washer and dryer. Make sure kitchens and bathrooms are well ventilated. Run air conditioners and dehumidifiers as needed., Seal the concrete with water-proofing chemicals. Seal any cracks in the concrete walkway around your home with concrete, caulking or tar.If you plan to paint concrete walls, use a waterproof sealant first, then apply stain-blocking primer and paint.For outdoors, try a high quality acrylic sealer made for exterior use. If your weather tends to be warm and humid, look for a low-solids solvent-based sealer. Choose dry, sunny weather and allow the sealer to dry for at least two to three days."

Remove the mold to create a healthier, cleaner, safer home.Mold can aggravate existing allergies.
Mold has been linked to respiratory tract infections and lung disease.
Mold can cause coughing, wheezing and increased effects of asthma.;
, Vinegar is a natural and organic material, but extended exposure to vinegar can cause irritation to your skin. Protect your skin by wearing gloves when you are working with vinegar.

, Do not dilute the vinegar with water. Make sure that you have enough vinegar to cover the surface you would like to clean., Cover the area thoroughly with the vinegar. Be generous in how much you use to be sure that there is enough vinegar to attempt to break up the mold.If you do not have a spray bottle handy, you can also use a disposable cloth. Thoroughly wet the cloth with vinegar and wipe the area of mold to soak it in vinegar.

, It takes a little time for the vinegar to work into the mold and break it. Give it at least an hour before you return to scrub the mold away.

, Using a brush, scrub at the area of mold which has been sitting in the vinegar. Continue to clean your brush off in warm water as you work through the moldy area.Using a scrub brush will make it easier to break up the mold, as well as keeping your skin further removed from the vinegar while you are cleaning.
Find a brush that is the appropriate size for the job. You may want a larger brush to cover more surface area, or a smaller brush to reach into cracks and corners.

, Once you have dislodged the mold from the surface, wipe the space clean using warm water and allow the area to dry. If the mold persists, repeat this entire process until all the mold has been removed.Vinegar will likely leave an odor, which will fade within a few hours.

, Vinegar is thought to kill 82% of species of mold. If this is true, that still leaves you with the possibility of 18% of persistent species. If vinegar does not seem to be cutting through your mold problem, try mixing it with borax, hydrogen peroxide, baking soda or salt.Only mix the vinegar with one of these products at a time. If it is still not working, try mixing it with another.
Never mix vinegar with bleach. This creates dangerous, toxic fumes.

Common places to find black mold include basements, crawl spaces, bathrooms, and laundry rooms. Here are a few of the identifying characteristics of black mold:It appears black in color
It grows in a circular pattern
Patches of black mold look like they're made up of dots
It looks slimy on a wet surface
On a dry surface, it will look like soot;
, To prevent mold spores from becoming airborne and spreading, you can seal the room. Put up sheets of plastic to cover doors and vents that lead to other areas of the house. Use painter’s or construction tape to tape the plastic in place and seal the room.Vents you may want to cover include return vents, and heating and air conditioning vents. Leave exhaust vents open.
Sealing the area will help prevent spores from spreading from one area of the house to another.
Sealing won’t necessarily stop mold from growing elsewhere in the house. Mold spores are always present in the air, and mold can grow anywhere that there's moisture.

, Mold itself and the cleaning products you use to kill it can irritate eyes, skin, and lungs, so you must provide yourself with as much fresh air as possible. In the area where you're going to be attacking the mold, open as many windows as possible.In winter when it’s cold out, open at least one or two windows to let in some fresh air.

, To help draw mold spores out of the room and out of the house, turn on any exhaust fans in the room you're working in. You can also position a fan in front of an open window and aim it outside. This will similarly draw mold spores out of the room and push them outside.


To prevent blowing mold spores around the room, avoid using fans if they're not right in front of a window and blowing air outside.

, Mold exposure can cause upper respiratory illness, and the cleaners you use to kill the mold may also be damaging and corrosive. To protect yourself while you're cleaning, consider wearing protective gear, including:Safety goggles
Non-porous gloves
Mask or respirator

, You will have to choose a cleaning solution to kill the mold, and it’s important that you stick to that one cleaner. Mixing different cleaners can be very dangerous, and you can create unexpected chemical reactions.Never mix ammonia or bleach together or with any other household cleaners.

, Removing mold from absorbent materials can be extremely difficult. Instead, most professionals will recommend that you remove and replace such items, since it probably won’t be possible to remove the mold without damaging the material or causing further problems.


Absorbent materials that may need to be replaced include drywall, ceiling tiles, furniture and carpeting., Fill a bucket with warm water, and add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of liquid dish soap. Swish the soap around in the water to make suds. Dip a stiff-bristled brush into the soapy water and scrub the moldy surface with the brush.Re-dip the brush regularly and scrub until the area is saturated with suds. Rinse the area with water.


Pre-scrubbing the mold will help break up the surface so that you can penetrate to the roots with your cleaner and kill the mold.

, There are a number of cleaning solutions and products you can use to clean mold. The most effective will be a commercial biocide or antimicrobial cleaner, which is specifically designed to kill mold.There are other cleaning solutions you can try that have proven effective, including:Equal parts ammonia and water
1 cup (235 ml) of bleach mixed with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water
Pure distilled vinegar
1 teaspoon (5 ml) of tea tree oil and 1 cup (235 ml) of water
Equal parts baking soda and water, mixed into a paste in a bowl
One part hydrogen peroxide mixed with two parts water
1 cup (409 g) of borax dissolved in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water
¼ cup (102 g) of borax dissolved in ½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar and 4 cups (940 ml) of warm water

, For liquid solutions, spray generous amounts of cleaner on the moldy surface that you pre-scrubbed. For pastes, apply the paste to the affected area with a knife, brush, or old tooth brush.


Let the cleaner stand for about 15 minutes. This will give it time to penetrate the mold and kill it all the way to the roots, which will prevent it from growing back., When the cleaner has had time to soak in, scrub the surface with a stiff-bristled brush. This will help dislodge the mold and work the cleaner in even farther.You can use an non-abrasive scrubbing pad to scrub the area as well.

, To remove any leftover mold and cleaner, rinse the area with clean water. When the mold and cleaner are gone, wipe the area dry with a towel or a squeegee. This will remove excess moisture and prevent the mold from growing back.Mold can start growing on a damp surface within 24 hours, which is why it’s important to keep the area dry after cleaning.

, Mold can be notoriously difficult to clean, especially in hard to reach places and on certain materials, such as dry wall and other porous materials. There are times when it’s best to call a mold removal professional, including if:Your cleaning effort wasn’t effective
The affected area is larger than 10 square feet (3 square meters)
You suspect there's mold in your heating, cooling, or ventilation system
You have any health concerns about the mold
The mold problem was caused by contaminated water or sewage

, As long as there's a moisture source, there's the potential for mold. After cleaning your mold problem, it’s essential that you remove the source of the moisture that caused the mold to grow in the first place.Depending on where in the house the mold was, possible moisture problems could include:


Leaks
Floods
Spills
Dampness from cooking or bathing
Lack of moisture barrier in the basement

, Mold thrives in humid environments where the moisture levels are above 50 percent. To prevent mold, install a hygrometer and keep and eye on the humidity levels. When it gets too high, ways to reduce humidity include:Running a dehumidifier
Running the air conditioner
Opening windows
Increasing ventilation
Opening windows and using vents when cooking

, Showers and tubs are common places for mold to grow because they stay wet all the time. To prevent this, keep a squeegee in the bathroom and ask that all family members and guests wipe down the walls after bathing.


You should also open a window or turn on the bathroom fan anytime somebody uses the bathroom to bathe or shower.

, Leaks are a huge source of moisture problems in homes, and the extra moisture creates a prime environment for mold to grow. You can still prevent mold even if a leak occurs, but you do have to act quickly to fix the leak and dry the area. Leaks to look out for include:Burst pipes
Leaking pipes
Roof leaks
Basement and foundation leaks

, Floods can often lead to mold because there's a lot of water that comes in at once, and it’s not always possible to clean it all right away. After a flood, the steps you should take as soon as possible to clean include:Removing all the excess water
Using a wet vacuum to get rid of dampness
Replacing damaged carpeting, flooring, and drywall
Using mold-inhibiting cleaners

Limit speeds on your driveway/road.,
Get a tractor.,
Get a 'box scraper'.,
Have a chain harrow.,
Use a grader blade.,
Work on the road/driveway.,
Use the box scraper on the surface.",How to Maintain a Dirt or Gravel Drive or Road," If drivers stay below about 20 mph (32 km/h) (hence the 15 mph (24 km/h) sign since everyone speeds), then the road will not ""washboard,"" pothole, or otherwise deteriorate as fast as with higher speeds.;
, The tractor is probably the most important (and, most expensive) piece of equipment needed. The front loader is very valuable if you want to move gravel or dirt. It can also be used for some snow plowing.

, It is important to have enough tractor horsepower to pull the selected scraper. Recommendations are usually for about 5hp per foot of scraper width. You can get by with somewhat less horsepower as long as your transmission is strong-enough and you go slower.{{largeimage|Cat Scraper.jpg} ""Professional"" Version -- Far smaller ones are available for use behind a small tractor.}

, A chain harrow is useful for smoothing. You won't need it for every maintenance session, but it is invaluable for smoothing out washboarding during dry periods. You will be limited as to when you can work on the road as it ages -- basically unless you have professional-level equipment or a loose surface, you will need to wait for rain or snow to soften the surface. The harrow can help in the dry season, but the box scraper is the ultimate tool.

, The grader blade is useful to move gravel or dirt back toward the center of the road. Traffic, snow plowing, and even the box scraper tends to move material out towards the edges of the road. Periodically, if you run the grader blade (set at an angle) along the edges of the road, you can move the edge material back towards the center of the road. This will reduce you costs for gravel for resurfacing. Remove the pin to allow the blade to rotate along the axis of the tractor (the back pin on the grader blade).

, Unless the surface is loose (loose gravel or soft dirt), you will probably have to wait for it to be what is call ""juicy"" (wet after a soaking rain, basically). The grader blade can be used to return gravel/dirt back toward the middle of the road -- if you don't have much gravel or loose dirt on your drive/road, then this can reduce your costs for buying gravel.

, Running the box scraper will do about 90% of the work of maintaining your road. Leave the tines in the ""up"" position and just use the blade on the bottom to scrape the surface. Depending on the width of your scraper and your road, you simply run up/down the road until the entire surface has been scraped. What happens is that the scraper will pick up gravel and dirt until the box is full. Then, the material will be redeposited on the road in an even layer. This will scrape high points and fill-in low points. For the first time, you may need (want) to run over the surface a few times -- after initially getting the road (relatively) smooth, monthly maintenance for heavily-traveled neighborhood roads and quarterly maintenance for a driveway works well.


The scraper works well when set to simply level with the road surface. You can adjust the ""bite"" by raising/lowering the top hitch.

You can repeat this method with a slightly higher concentration of bleach (for example, half bleach, half water) if the 3-to-1 ratio doesn’t work.
Never attempt to mix other chemicals with diluted bleach. For example, ammonia – found in many cleaning agents – emits toxic fumes when mixed with bleach.

, Thoroughly wet any tiles in the area with warm water before using any bleach solution. Even if you’re just cleaning the grout, spatter will land on tiling. Pre-wetting tiles with water saturates them to limit their absorption of chemicals., Use a narrow brush such as an old, stiff toothbrush or any natural bristle or nylon brush. Scrub the grout with the solution in small sections.Bleach can lighten mold so that it isn’t visible. Scrubbing is needed to reach into grout’s pores and remove organic growth., Let the solution remain on each section of grout for about three minutes. Then rinse it clean with clear water.Letting bleach sit for more than a few minutes can cause staining, streaking, or even breakage to tile.

, Buff away any remaining moisture with clean cloths. Leave the window open or fan running until the grout feels totally dry.

Put mild white vinegar in a spray bottle without diluting it.,
Spray the vinegar onto moldy surfaces and wait for an hour.,
After an hour, wipe the area clean with hot water and dry the surface with a towel.,
Use vinegar to prevent outbreaks of mold before they happen.",How to Remove Bathroom Mold2," Vinegar has a mild acidity, making anywhere you spray it very inhospitable for mold. Do not dilute the vinegar when placing it into the spray bottle; you want to use it at full-strength, not watered-down.

, If possible, let the bathroom air out during this time.

, Damp surfaces encourage mold growth, so be sure to wipe the area clean fully. After you have wiped the vinegar away, it should not smell anymore.

, Vinegar is reported to kill 82% of mold species, making it an exceptionally effective solution for preventing mold from inhabiting your bathroom like it owns the place. Plus, vinegar does not have any toxic fumes (like bleach) and is all-natural.


Simply spray a bit of vinegar onto a mold-prone surface and leave it. If you do this regularly, mold will have a tough time growing, and you will not have to remove it in the first place.

Mix one cup of borax with one gallon of water.,
Vacuum up any mold spores with a HEPA filtered vacuum before you clean.,
With a brush, attack the moldy surface with the borax solution.

,
Be vigilant about the cleaning solution and/or mold spores traveling to different areas while you clean.,
Wipe up the borax solution and let dry.",How to Remove Bathroom Mold3," Borax is a natural cleaner and also serves as a natural insecticide. It has the benefit of being cheap, readily available, and quite effective. Find it in your local grocery store in the cleaning aisle.

, This will minimize the chance that you will spread spores around and simply displace them instead of removing them entirely.

,, You do not want to give the mold a new, nice place to live.

, If you are worried about re-contamination, spray a bit of vinegar in the area to prevent another outbreak.

Never mix ammonia and bleach together.,
Be sure to use only ""clear ammonia."",
Put the ammonia into a spray bottle and spray the ammonia onto the moldy surface.

,
Scrub the area thoroughly with a brush to ensure complete removal of any mold or spores.,
Wipe away after a few hours.

",How to Remove Bathroom Mold4," Ammonia mixed with bleach creates hazardous fumes that can be extremely dangerous. This also means avoiding mixing ammonia-based cleaners (such as many glass cleaners) and bleach.

, Ammonia come in ""clear"" and ""cloudy"" or ""sudsy"" varieties.

,, Leave for an hour or two. Let the air breathe if at all possible, as the smell of ammonia is very strong and unpleasant.

Place 3% hydrogen peroxide in a dark spray bottle.,
Perform a spot test on the surface where the mold is on.,
Spray the moldy surface completely and let stand for 10 to 20 minutes while the peroxide attacks the mold.

,
Leave for an hour or two.,
Wipe the surface clean.

",How to Remove Bathroom Mold5," Hydrogen peroxide's effectiveness will diminish if it is exposed to light, so be sure to store it in a dark spray bottle to keep it effective.


If desired, add a little bit of vinegar to the hydrogen peroxide solution in order to up the effectiveness of the solution.

, A spot test will test whether the hydrogen peroxide causes the surface to fade.

,, Let the air breathe if at all possible, as the smell of hydrogen peroxide is very strong and unpleasant.

Spray the grout with diluted vinegar.,
Treat the grout with hydrogen peroxide.,
Use a steam cleaner.,
Strip and reseal the caulk.",How to Clean Mold from Grout3," Fill a bucket or spray bottle with one part water to one part white vinegar. Leave the solution on the grout for five minutes. Scrub the grout with a narrow scrub brush or stiff toothbrush. Rinse the area clean with warm water.Vinegar is acid-based, so make sure to do a small test area first to make sure the solution doesn’t affect your surrounding tile.
Optionally, apply a paste of baking soda and water to the grout before dousing it with the vinegar solution. The combination will bubble up. Then scrub and rinse.

, Make sure to do a small test area first. Use a spray bottle or sponge to apply hydrogen peroxide to your grout. Allow it to sit for several minutes. Scrub the grout with a narrow scrub brush or toothbrush. Rinse completely with warm water.Try repeating this several times.
Baking soda is abrasive, so keep it off the tile as much as possible.

, Choose a machine with high heat and a brush attachment.Don’t use a machine with a beater bar, which can damage tile. You may want to check if your brand of tile is compatible with using a steam cleaner first.For example, steam cleaners are not recommended for ceramic tile., If all else fails, use a sharp-edged tool to scrape away the caulk. Clean the area with a solution of three parts water to one part bleach, and let it dry. Use mildew-resistant caulk to discourage future mold. Make sure to seal the grout correctly so that organic growth won’t re-enter.If you think the mold may have gotten underneath tiling or otherwise penetrated the structure of the room, you may want to renovate and re-tile the area.

Cut down on moisture.,
Wipe tiles and grout after showering or cooking.,
Spray diluted tea tree oil regularly as a mold preventative.,
Keep nearby fabrics dry.,
Clean routinely to prevent mold.",How to Clean Mold from Grout4," Keep a door or window open when you’re showering. Alternately, run a dehumidifier or portable fan after showering. If you have a vent fan, run it before, during, and after your shower.For example, turn on your vent fan before a morning shower, and keep it running until you leave for the day. Even when the mirror is no longer foggy, there can still be moisture in the air.
Mold and mildew thrive where it’s warm, airless and damp.

, Dry wet grout thoroughly after using moisture in the kitchen or bathroom. Keep a squeegee in the bathroom and squeegee the walls and floor after showering.Using a squeegee after showering will cut down on surface buildup.

, Add ten drops of tea tree oil to a clean spray bottle filled with water. Keep the spray bottle in the bathroom and use the “mist” setting to spray tiles and grout after showering.You should perform this on a small test area first to make sure there is no negative effect.

, Spread out any wet or damp towels so they can totally dry. For rooms that face a lot of moisture, such as kitchens and bathrooms, opt for synthetic materials, since they hold less moisture.For example, choose polyester or vinyl for items like bathmats and curtains.

, Spray the grout monthly with an anti-fungal solution. For example, fill a spray bottle with one part water to one part white vinegar. Spray and wipe down the grout. Let the solution dry naturally rather than rinsing it off.


If your grout is in a bathroom, clean soap scum weekly.

Clean your bathroom regularly.",How to Clean Mildew from Grout," If you clean regularly, mildew is probably mild. A small film of mildew covering grout does not require special cleaners. For this mildew, stick to simply scrubbing water between the tiles. This should be enough to get rid of unwanted mildew.If mildew does not come out with water alone, you may need a stronger cleaner.;
, Mildew that is built up over time requires a cleaner. Bleach is the best course of action to remove mildew. You can buy bleach online or at a local department store.As bleach is dangerous if ingested, make sure to store it in a safe place away from children and pets.
Wear gloves when handling bleach.

, In a bucket, mix three parts water with one part bleach. The precise amount of bleach and water you need depends on how much mildew you're cleaning. Make sure to mix bleach in a well-ventilated area., Place your bleach solution is a spray bottle. Spritz a liberal amount of the solution over tiles, focusing on where you see built up mildew. Let the solution sit for about 15 minutes before continuing with the cleaning process., Use a microfiber cloth to scrub in between the towels to remove the mildew. It will take some force to scrub out mildew, especially set-in mildew, so scrub the cloth hard in areas where mildew appears.Remember to wear gloves if you're scrubbing in bleach.

, If there is mildew built up in cracks and crevices, use a toothbrush. A toothbrush is a great tool to get into corners and cracks where mildew lingers.Make sure to check cracks where grout is found for mildew. These areas are often neglected during cleaning, which can cause mildew to spread.

, There is no secret to removing mildew other than a lot of hard work. Mildew, especially if it's been built up over long periods of time, can sometimes be difficult to remove. Make sure to give yourself adequate time to fully remove the mildew. For grout that's heavily infested with mildew, the job may take over an hour to complete., Mildew can sometimes cause water deposits to build up on the walls surrounding grout and tiles. If you notice water deposits, saturate a paper towel with white vinegar. Place the towels over the water stains and leave them on for a few hours. Then, remove the paper towels and use a cloth or cleaning brush to scrub out the stains., A well-ventilated shower is key to preventing mildew to begin with. If your shower has a fan, make sure to turn that on after getting out of the shower. It also helps to crack a window in your bathroom during the day., Keep a spray bottle in your bathroom filled with one part vinegar and one part water. Two to three times a week, use this mixture to spray down your shower. This will help prevent mildew from building up on the shower walls., Mildew is hardest to remove when it's built up in grout between tiles. The best way to prevent the need for heavy cleaning is to clean your bathroom once a week. If you do a quick, mild cleaning weekly, you're unlikely to have to deal with heavy mildew removal in the future."

Find a contractor.,
Remove your current driveway surface.,
Grade your driveway slope.,
Compact the base soil.,
Cover the base soil with crushed rock.,
Pack the crushed rock into the subsoil.

,
Allow this base to settle for approximately 1 week.,
Choose an asphalt size and thickness.,
Compact the asphalt with a heavy roller.

,
Treat the edges of the driveway.",How to Install Asphalt," It's important to feel comfortable with the person you hire. Ask your friends and family for recommendations. You want a contractor who will do a thorough job and who has the best equipment. Have discussions with potential contractors before hiring them. Study the contract to confirm everything you wish to be done is spelled out in the document.


Be wary of anyone who claims that they have extra asphalt that they can put down for a discounted price. The asphalt will most likely be of poor quality and workmanship.;
, This might include breaking up existing concrete and removing the pieces or collecting loose gravel. The surface needs to be completely clean and clear before continuing. There should no grease or oil stains.

,


In order to achieve proper drainage and prevent a collapsed or heaved driveway, the surface should be graded so that water runs off to the sides or bottom.






Run a hose at the top of your driveway to determine where the water runs. Keep in mind that this sub-base must be completely dry before putting in new asphalt so that the asphalt will adhere fully when installed.






Build mounds and fill in low spots to achieve the proper grade. An optimal slope is 1/4 inch per foot (0.635 cm per 30.48 cm).







, A 3,000-pound (1,361 kg) twin drum roller is the best machinery for compacting soil and other surfaces. You may be able to rent one from an equipment rental outlet. If your contractor does not use this type of equipment, it is important to make sure that the soil is properly compacted.

,


The type of crushed rock used is crucial to proper drainage. The composition of the rock should be coarse and jagged. This type is usually called '3/4"" minus' or 'Road-base' mix.






If your underlying soil is clay-based, you will need 8 inches (20.32) of crushed rock.






If your underlying soil is sandy, you will need 4 inches (10.16 cm) of crushed rock.







,, Many contractors will skip this step due to time. The benefit of allowing the base to settle is a stronger, more naturally settled base. If the base material is not allowed to settle properly, it will most likely fail from movement occurring under the new asphalt.

,


The size of the aggregate used to create asphalt pavement ranges from 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch (1.27 cm to 1.9 cm).
Smaller aggregate is usually used for residential driveways because it gives a smoother appearance. If the aggregate is larger, however, the pavement is stronger. The best layer thickness is 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm).

,,


The asphalt should be formed at a 45-degree angle at the edges.

Dig up the ground.,
Add a gravel base to the area.,
Add a layer of fine sand over the gravel and compact it.,
Lay the pavers in the pattern you desire.,
Cut paver blocks to fit around obstacles.,
Install edging around the patio perimeter.,
Fill the cracks with sand.,
Compact the patio.,
Finish off the edges of the patio.,
Seal your pavers.",How to Install Patio Pavers," This allows you to determine how many pavers to buy, as well as how much of the other supplies you will need. You need to have a clear idea of what you want your patio to look like so you can ensure you buy enough materials. Measure the length and width of the area you want to cover. Multiply the length times the width. This will give you the square footage of your future patio.


If the shape of your patio is not square but you will use square pavers, you will need to estimate the square footage. Another option is to use pavers that are designed to be laid in round shapes. These type of pavers will require you to take different types of measurements to determine the amount of pavers needed.
If you are building stairs on your patio, you may need to subtract the square footage of the bottom stair and purchase some retaining blocks.;
, Pavers come in a multitude of shapes, sizes, colors, and prices, so you have decisions to make. When determining which pavers to use, compare how much it will cost you to cover the whole patio area. Some pavers are sold by the square foot and some are sold as individual blocks. Small pavers may be cheaper individually but they could end up costing you more in the end to cover your square footage. They are also much more labor-intensive, which can cost you in terms of time and effort.


To figure out how many pavers you will need, multiply the square footage of your patio by the stones per square foot of the pavers you are considering (a number that should be on price labels or listed on product specs), this will give you the number of stones needed. For example, if you are making a 100 square foot patio and the pavers you are using are listed as 4 square feet per piece, multiply 100 by 4 and the total number of pieces you will need is 400. Once you have that number, you can figure out how much specific pavers will cost you overall by multiplying the number of pavers needed by the price per paver.
Remember, pavers can be arranged in a multitude of different patterns; a sales associate at your home improvement store should be able to make suggestions if you can't decide.
Make sure you discuss delivery options with the sales associate. A large number of pavers will weigh quite a lot, and you will likely need them to deliver a pallet to your home.

, You will need more than pavers to install a patio. The patio should include a layer of gravel and a layer of sand below the pavers, as well as a barrier to keep the pavers in place. All of these supplies should be purchased before you start your project.


To determine the amount of gravel and sand you will need to buy, determine the volume of the space you are filling or the cubic feet and cubic yards.The gravel should be at least 4 inches deep, but this will be compacted, so you will want to add another 1.5 inches to your calculation. The sand should be over 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, so these measurements should be multiplied by the square footage of the patio.This will give you the cubic feet you need. You can also use an online calculator, such as the one here: http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/construction/

If all else fails, consult a sales associate at your home improvement store. They should be able to help you figure out how much sand and gravel you will need for the square footage of your patio. Talk to them about your options for buying supplies like sand in bulk to save money.
Make sure you buy polymeric sand to fill in the spaces or joints between the pavers. Regular washed sand will not bind together well and your pavers will become loose.
Decide if you want to lay a fabric weed barrier between the gravel and the pavers. The sand and gravel is usually enough to keep weeds from growing between your pavers, but this added layer provides additional blockage. Make sure the barrier is porous so that you still get proper drainage through the gravel.When you purchase pavers makes sure you buy at least 10 percent more than you plan to use. Paver blocks can break or you may need to cut some to fit around obstacles.
You may also need to rent a gas powered plate compactor as well as a paver wet saw with diamond blade and stand if you need to trim or shape the pavers.

, Before digging up the backyard have your utility companies locate and mark underground lines. Local agencies vary but information on who to call in your specific area is usually available by calling 811. This will connect you to your local agencies.Don't make the mistake of assuming that there are no utilities in the area you are digging! It's better to be safe than sorry.

, Measure your patio dimensions and mark them on the ground with stakes at each corner of the plot. Wrap a string or thin rope around the stakes to outline the patio's perimeter. This will give you a good idea of how the patio will fit into the yard and it will make sure that you are only prepping the ground where the patio will actually be.


To keep your patio level from the start, it's a good idea to make sure your perimeter string is level (they sell little levels that hang from these strings at any home improvement store). If all of your strings are level, then you can measure down from the string at every step and your measurements will be based on the same starting point.
You can also use a laser level, which saves you the time and energy of setting up the strings by using laser light to check that everything is level.

, Excavate 6 to 8 inches by digging up and removing all the soil in the marked area. The depth you dig down will vary depending on how thick your pavers are and how much gravel you put down. This excavation should allow room so you can install paver edging on the perimeter of your patio.


Slope the entire area slightly toward the direction in which you want water to run off the patio pavers. Lay a board across the area, and place a level on top the board to get the desired slope.
A level perimeter string will come in handy here. Measure down from the string all around the patio space, to make sure you have dug down a consistent depth. You can even stretch a temporary string across the area to determine whether the middle is level as well.

, Pour a 4 to 6 inch layer of gravel into the patio trench and compact it using the ground compactor, also called a plate compactor. Spray water over the gravel to wet it down so the stones compact better.


If you don't own a compactor, you may be able to rent one at a local home improvement store. You can also use a hand tamper to get edges and corners that might be missed by the compactor.
Once again, measure off your level perimeter string to make sure your gravel is relatively even across the whole patio area. This does not need to be perfect, and in fact should slope a little bit away from any house it's next to, but it should give you a good idea if you are in the right ballpark.
If you plan to use a weed barrier, now is the time to lay it down. Make sure you have chosen a biodegradable and porous fabric so that it does not add toxins to the soil or interfere with drainage., The sand layer should be about an inch thick and follow the same grade as the gravel. This is the last layer you install before laying paver blocks, so make sure it is smooth. After laying down the sand and compacting it, lay down two pieces of round level piping more than 5 feet (1.5 m) apart, pushing them down into the sand. To make sure your surface is level, then take a 2 x 4 and pull it across the top of the two pieces of pipe, which will level out the sand underneath. Once the area is level, remove the pipes from the sand. You will be left with two indentations where the pipes were but the rest of your patio area will be ready for pavers. You may need to move your leveling pipes to several locations, depending on how big your patio is going to be. Just remember that you need to make the whole patio to be level overall.

, Start at one corner and keep the blocks as close to each other as possible. As you lay each paver down, tap it a bit with a rubber mallet so it is nicely seated in the sand.


Check your level as you work. The patio should keep the same level as you go along. If one paver is off, tap it with a rubber mallet to get it into place. If a paver is too low, don't be afraid to pull it up, put some more sand under it, and put it back in place. It's easier to get it right now instead of later. This is another point at which the level perimeter string may help you out. While you can use a level across the pavers themselves, measuring their distance away from the string will help keep everything aligned as well.

, If the patio needs to fit around trees or fencing, cut paver blocks using a saw with a diamond paver blade. These are available for rent from your local home improvement store and are a good investment if you have a lot of obstacles.


If you only have a bit of an obstacle in your way try creative fixes. If there is a spot that requires a small piece of paver, consider simply filling the space with pea gravel or a ground cover plant instead. This will save you time and energy that you will need for the rest of the project. You may also have a small piece of paver that was cut off, and you may be able to use it in these tight areas.

, Patio edging comes in a variety of materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Once all pavers are installed, secure the edging tightly against the outer edge of the pavers using spikes placed 2 feet (0.61 m) apart or closer. Whatever type of edging you choose, it will keep the pavers in place, preventing them from slowly creeping out of alignment.

, Cover the entire paved patio with a thin layer of polymeric sand. Use a broom to sweep the sand back and forth until it fills all the spaces between the pavers. If you notice that there are still gaps in-between pavers, add more sand and sweep it into the cracks. This may take a few passes.

, Attach a thick towel or piece of cardboard to the base of the compactor and go over the entire patio. As you go, make sure that the patio is staying relatively level. You want the pavers to be set well into the sand and that as little settling as possible will take place in the future. Don't be afraid to give a little force when compacting. While you don't want to break your freshly set pavers, they can take a good amount of force from a compactor with a cushioning cover over it.

, Fill in any areas along the patio edging with soil, gravel, grass, or ground cover. Basically you should fill the space at the edge of your patio with whatever material matches the rest of your yard.

, While pavers will last a very long time without sealing, taking the time to seal your pavers every few years will make them look better, preventing staining and deterioration. Use a sealer that is recommended by your paver manufacturer. "

, Garden hoses are long and flexible, making it easy to make changes.


Make certain the walkway is straight, unless you have the talent necessary to cut the bricks to fit a curved design.

, You'll want to mark each side of the walkway with stakes.


Tie colored string from stake to stake, making straight lines to use as a guide when digging.

, Follow the walkway and dig down into the ground about 8 inches (20.3 cm).


The depth of your walkway must be consistent for the entire walkway.

, This type of shovel works great for digging through tough soil and grass.

, While the walkway needs to be level, the ground should slope gently outward from the brick walkway to act as a runoff route for rain and snow.

, Be certain you evenly spread the gravel over your walkway.

, These stay in the ground and act as permanent support for your bricks. Your bricks should fit within the forms, which are flexible enough to compensate for any curves in your walkway border.

,, This works great under your bricks and acts like concrete once you water it and allow it to dry.

, Check your walkway every few feet with a level to be certain you are maintaining the proper height and curve.

, Using a rubber mallet, tamp each brick as you place it.

,, Be sure to sweep stone dust along the brick edges with a soft broom.

, The stone dust will become hard over time and hold the bricks in place.

Seal your paving stones.",How to Install Concrete Pavers,"  Use twine and sticks to mark the area where you will be laying your pavers and use it as a guide during the process.;
,  You will need to excavate 8 to 9 inches and then firmly compact the soil.  Be sure to measure once done so that your patio, driveway, or walkway does not accidentally slope in any one direction.

,  Your pavers should not be placed directly onto the soil.  Instead, they must be placed on top of a gravel base. High-quality, Class 2 Road Base is preferred for this type of project, and you will need enough to be 4 to 6 inches deep throughout the entire area.  If the concrete pavers are only being used for foot traffic, you can get by with a base that is only 3 to 4 inches deep.

,  If the area is prone to flooding, you may want to install a drainage system to ensure that the area remains free of standing water. There are several types of solutions you can use with the objective being to direct water away from the area using pipes or gravity.

,  This is a critical step for ensuring that your pavers remain secure and do not shift over time. The base must be firm and secure.

,  Placed on top of the gravel base, bedding sand provides a smooth surface for your concrete pavers to be placed on.  The sand needs to be 1 inch thick and perfectly leveled, the sand provides a gap and allows the pavers to be compacted.

,  Use your drawing or rendering as a reference and begin laying your concrete pavers in the correct pattern.  Begin with the interior pavers, placing them firmly onto the base and compacting them as you go. Next, lay your border pavers using the same technique.

, Once all of your pavers have been placed, apply pressure to set each stone to ensure that it is firmly secured to your sand base.

,  This sand is preferred as the finishing touch to your concrete pavers installation.  It is poured in between each paving stone and will serve to prevent weeds from growing in between the pavers, along with reducing the presence of unwanted insects.

,  Sweep away any loose sand or debris from your paving stones prior to washing them with water.

,  To prolong the life of your pavers, apply a paver sealer on an annual or bi-annual basis.

The installation crews normally work in four man teams.,
A typical installation would start off with a threshold of a door, or control point provided by the architect or contractor.

,
The first height of the pedestal is then determined.,
The “press fit” connection of the top and bottom cap to the PVC pipe requires no gluing or other attachments.,
Each top shim is designed to snap in to the top cap.,
Bottom shims are scored and can be broken in half using the one-half as a shim under the low side on a severely sloped roof system.,
In a triangle or non-90 degree corner you can use a bottom cap in place of the top cap.,
The weight of the concrete paver will keep the system in place.

",How to Install Pedestal Pavers," One keeps the pavers supplied to the installation site. One runs the chop saw and does the entire PVC cutting. PVC is usually cut for each new row as needed. You count how many intersections will need pedestals, measure in a couple of locations to get the height right and call out to the cutter how many at what length are needed. Two paver installers are setting and leveling.;
,, A standard chop saw (with fine tooth blade (12”) compatible with plastic) can cut the PVC pipe to the desired height. An installer then cuts the PVC pipe to the required height, less 1/4” for top and bottom cap insets. Example, a 2” high pedestal needs to have a piece of PVC cut 1-3/4”.


, Both the wedge top shims and round bottom shims can be used for “fine tuning” proper height if required. All top shims and bottom shims lock into place, and all six pieces (if used) interlock, allowing no paver movement and a level surface. The caps can be easily removed during installation if desired.

, Each bottom shim snaps into the bottom cap, they can stack to provide additional height.

, You are only building up the low side with this application.

, You are getting the same elevation (1/8”) but do not have to fool with the tabs on the top cap. Two bottom caps work well if you need to support the center of a large paver. It gives you a flat top in this application.

Create the foundation.,
Lay out your flagstones.,
Tamp the stones down.,
Fill the joints between the stones.",How to Install Flagstone1," To decide how much stone to buy, you'll need to calculate the square footage of the area you plan to cover. You'll also need to make sure your project is safe and legal before you expend your time, energy, and money on it.


Start by consulting local building codes to make sure your planned project doesn't violate the law. This information should be available on your city government's website. If you build something that is in violation of local codes, you may be forced to remove it, or may be unable to rent our sell your home to others.
It is also important to make sure there are not water or gas lines running near the surface in the area where you plan to lay your flagstone. You can call 8-1-1 to determine if this is a potential concern.Use marking paint to draw an outline of the area you plan to cover on the ground. This will make it easier to take measurements. To find the total area, multiply the length of the area you plan to cover by the width.;
, Once you've figured out how much ground you need to cover, you can calculate how much stone you'll need to buy.


For flagstone that is an inch or less in thickness, one ton will cover 180 to 200 square feet. Typically, though, flagstone under one inch in thickness is not recommended as it may crack or break with too much weight or foot traffic.
For flagstone that is an inch to an inch and a half thick, one ton will cover 90 to 100 square feet.
For flagstone that is two inches or more in thickness, one ton will cover 70 to 80 square feet.
It is a good idea to order about 10 percent more stone than you calculate you will need.

, Use highly visible marking paint or lay garden hoses out over the edges of the area you are going to excavate. Then, cut through the sod and roots along the inner edge of the hose using a flat-blade shovel or edger. Dig out the entire area.


Depending on the thickness of the stones you plan to lay, you'll need to dig three to six inches down.

, To keep the edges of your foundation even, you'll need to line the sides of the excavated area with edging material. You can use treated lumber (""benderboard""), vinyl, steel, bricks, or carved stone. Steel spikes should be driven into the ground to secure flexible edging materials.

, Your foundation should have three layers: landscape fabric, gravel, and sand.


Landscape fabric prevents weeds and separates your foundation from the native soil. The edges of the fabric can be secured under your edging material.Next, lay two to four inches of pea stone or small gravel. Tamp it down with a tamper to make it compact and even.Some people opt not to use gravel in their foundation. Gravel makes it easier for water to run off your path or patio, so it is highly recommended that you apply a layer of gravel if you live in a rainy area.Finally, pour your sand. You should cover your foundation with one to two inches of sand and then smooth it out with a rake.You may find wetting down the sand with a hose makes it easier to secure your flagstones., Place your stones in the pattern you desire with the best-looking side up. Try to keep about the same amount of space between each stone.


Begin by laying stones along the perimeter of the area you are covering, using pieces with edges that fit the edges of your path or patio, and work inward. This will reduce the number of stones you need to cut down to make them fit properly.
Because of their stability, large stones should be placed near doorways and other heavily trafficked areas.Stones that are too large or do not have the desired shape can be cut with a chisel and rock hammer.
If your stones vary in width, you may need to add or remove sand from beneath some of them in order to get a level surface. Be sure your flagstone is smooth to avoid potential tripping hazards., Use a rubber mallet to tap the stones into place one by one.

, The final step is to fill the gaps between the flagstones, both to secure them in place and complete the aesthetic look of your path or patio.


There are many options you can choose from for joint filler, including pea gravel, decomposed granite, or sand. You can also put topsoil between the stones and plant a ground-covering plant, such as wooly thyme or ordinary grass.To fill your joints, just dump the filling material onto the flagstones and sweep it into the joints with a broom.

Remove furniture and plants.,
Clear moss and weed growth.,
Saturate the paver surface.,
Prepare a mild cleaning solution.,
Brush the pavers with a stiff brush.,

Mist the sanded pavers.,
Consult a specialist.,
Check the condition of the pavers.,
Apply paver sealer to edges and crannies.,
Complete the first coat of sealer.,
Apply the second coat of sealer.,
Allow the sealer to dry.,
Move back furniture.",How to Clean Pavers," Depending on where your pavers are located, remove any potted plants or furniture that can get in the way of cleaning.You want a clear surface free of obstacles while cleaning.


At this point, cover any surrounding landscaping with tarp that may be damaged by water or chemicals in the cleaning products. Be sure to also cover metal objects.;
, Use a stiff bristled handheld brush or brush broom to agitate and brush away any moss growth on or in between pavers.Gently pull weeds out in between paver joints. When all of the organic growth has been loosened, brush the debris off of your paved surface.


If the growth is too heavy to remove by hand, spray a vegetation killer and wait at least two weeks before cleaning the pavers.

, Before you start cleaning the paver surface with soap or any other type of cleanser, hose down the entire area with water. You don’t need to power wash the area at this point; the pavers merely need to be wet so they don’t soak up the cleanser and form a murky film., The safest and easiest cleanser to start with is a mixture of warm water and a mild degreaser detergent.Fill up a gallon sized bucket with water and add about 16oz of dish detergent. Mix the soap into the water thoroughly. Once your cleaning solution is ready, gently pour some onto your paver surface, working in small areas at a time., Use a stiff bristled broom to scrub the cleaning solution into the paver surface.The harsh scrubbing from the broom bristles will loosen engrained dirt and stains. Scrub in different directions to avoid wearing out the same spot.


You may use a wire brush or scouring pad instead. Don't overdo it, as these tools can scratch the paver surface.

, Once you are finished scrubbing and cleaning your paver surface, gently rinse off the cleaning solution with clean water and into a nearby drain.You can use a regular garden hose to rinse off the cleanser or use a power washer to blast off harsh stains.


However, power washers can sometimes cause more harm than good (by excavating sand in between paver joints), so be careful if you decide to use a power washer., If detergent doesn't do the job, visit a home improvement store and look for a specialized cleaning product for your material (concrete, travertine, etc.). Many of these are highly corrosive and/or toxic, including TSP (trisodium phosphate) and muriatic acid. Read the warning label and make sure everyone in the area follows safety precautions. This may include wearing rubber boots, protective clothing, rubber gloves, mask, and safety glasses. Strong treatments can be a risk to children, pets, and vegetation, and may damage your pavers if used incorrectly., In most cases, the sand between the pavers is running low and needs a touch-up. Once the pavers are dry, pour a small mound of polymeric sand onto them. Sweep the sand all over on the paved surface with a dry, stiff bristled broom.Brush in multiple directions for more even coverage. Keep pouring on more sand and sweeping until the joints are filled.


Polymeric sand locks the pavers together more effectively than regular sand.

, Once all the sand is spread out into the paver joints, use a mist setting on your hose to mist water over the pavers.The misted water will allow the sand to settle in between the paver joints. Try not to saturate the pavers and wash away the newly laid sand.

, Visit your local home improvement store to consult a specialist about what type of sealer you should use on your paved surface based on your paver material and your desired look.Sealer will protect your pavers and simplify upkeep.


Besides getting the advice of a specialist, always follow the directions on the sealer project you plan to use. Wear safety gloves to project yourself from harsh chemicals in the sealant., If the joints between the pavers are low on sand, add more sand as described above until they are well packed. If the pavers are damp, wait until they are completely dry before you begin sealing.

, Before you seal the entire surface, apply sealer to the edges with a small, clean brush. Do the same for any nooks that might be difficult to reach with a roller brush.

, Pour your paver sealer into a paint roller tin. Use a long roller brush to apply the sealer onto your paver surface.Be sure to start in an area where you can move around and not trap yourself into a corner.The sealant instructions should indicate the drying time for the first coat of sealant, before the second coat can be applied.

, When the first coat of sealant is completely dry, start the second coat in the same way, using a small brush to cover the edges of the surface. Finish the second coat with a roller brush as before, but apply it at a different angle than the first coat for a more even application. When the pavers start darkening in color, that will indicate that the pavers are properly absorbing the sealant.Try not to let the sealer puddle in any areas. If you see this happening, simply continue to spread out the sealer with your roller brush.

, Allow the sealant to dry completely for at least 24 hours before allowing traffic onto the surface.If you want to check on the drying progress, you can use your fingers to gently touch the paved surface., When the paver sealant is completely dry (after at least a full 24 hours), move back any furniture or potted plants.You can also remove any tarp covering surrounding plants or metal surfaces."

Establish the purpose of your garden path or paths.,
Plan where your walking paths will go and decide the shape and direction they will take.,
Consider the width of your walking path.,
Choose the kinds of material you want to use to pave your walking path.,
Soften your path with attractive border plants and features such as statuary, large stones or bird feeders.,
Plant short grasses, herbs, or ground cover in between stepping stones to add charm and soften the effect.

,
Provide adequate lighting for walkers using the path at night.,
Clear the area where your path will go of plants and debris and consult with your local building supply center as to how to lay stone or concrete.",How to Create a Walking Path,"


Guide visitors through your property by using walking paths. They will more likely go where you want them to go and avoid areas you'd rather they not be.
Have walking paths that allow you easy access to garden sheds and other utility areas.
Walking paths can lead to an outstanding feature or view. You can position a gazebo,an arbor or fountain at the end of a pathway. Try not to have paths that lead to nowhere.
Walking paths add beauty and visual interest to your garden. They tie your garden design elements together.;
,


Use a measuring tape to calculate how much material you will have to purchase to pave your pathway.
Gently curving paths are visually appealing and interesting for the walker to navigate. Straight walking paths are good for very formal gardens. You might also keep the main access path wide and straight while allowing for smaller, curving adjoining pathways.
Use garden hose or some other material to lay out the shape of your pathway before you begin to dig or pave.

,


Allow 2 to 3 feet (0.91 m) (60 to 90 cm) in width for the average walker. For two people to walk side by side, the pathway width should be 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) (1.2 to 1.5 m) wide.
Be sure the path is wide enough for a wheelchair or stroller if necessary.
Make certain your garden path can accommodate wheelbarrows, lawnmowers and other garden equipment.

,


Your walkways can be simple grassy lanes, made of elaborate stone or a combination of many materials.
Landscape pavers come in all shapes, sizes, colors and prices. Visit your local garden or building supply store to explore your choices.
There are many choices for natural stone as well although this material can be expensive. Flagstone is a good choice.
Think about using mulch or pea gravel for your garden walk. These materials are less expensive but also less durable and will need to be reapplied from time to time. Perhaps use these for less used paths and a more substantial product for your main walkway.
Concrete is a very permanent material to consider although it often looks less attractive than other choices. Stamped concrete might be an alternative. Be sure when using this material that you won't want to change the location or direction of the path in the future.
Bricks and cobblestones can be used for your path. Or consider a combination of materials such as brick and concrete together.
Make sure the material you use for your walk will be safe. Ensure that the pathway doesn't become slippery after a rain, for example.

, The walking path can be a divider between various gardens.

,, You can hard-wire your lights or use inexpensive solar lighting. Spotlights can be positioned in trees to add interest and beauty or placed where there are steps for safety. For occasional lighting to use for an evening party, for instance, use luminaries or string small lights along the pathway.

, You might think about using a weed barrier fabric before laying paving material.

Plan, purchase, excavate and create your foundation.,
Pressure wash your flagstones.,
Lay out your stones and cut as necessary.,
Mix your mortar.,
Lay your stones in a bed of mortar.,
Let it dry.,
Fill the joints.,
Seal the joints.",How to Install Flagstone2," Follow the steps laid out in method one, up through step five, the creation of a gravel and sand foundation.


To ornament an existing patio or path, you can also cover a pre-existing concrete slab with flagstones using the mortared flagstone technique. In this case, you can skip the excavation stage and just work on top of the slab., A clean surface will ensure a better bond to the mortar.If working on a concrete slab, pressure wash it as well.

, Follow the same procedure detailed in step six of method one.


Make certain you are satisfied with your layout. Once you start to put the stones in place with mortar, it will be very difficult to move them.
If you are planning to fill your joints with grout or mortar, try to keep your joints narrow. If using sand or gravel, you can make the joints any size you find aesthetically pleasing. If using grout or mortar as joint filler, the flagstone surface will have a cleaner look and a smoother finish if you fit your stones together such that you keep the joints narrow and as uniform as possible., Mortar is a mix of sand, cement, and water. You should mix two measures of sand to every one measure of cement. Then, slowly add water while stirring the mixture. Continue adding water until you get a consistency similar to cake frosting.It's a good idea to mix up a small practice batch or two before you mix up a large enough batch to lay your stones.

, One by one, lift each stone, apply mortar to your bed of sand and gravel or the concrete slab you are attaching your stones to, then set the stone into the wet mortar.


If your stones are not of uniform thickness, you will need to apply additional mortar underneath some of them to get an even surface. In this case, start by identifying the thickest stone and mortaring it in first. Then, work outward from this stone, ensuring that each subsequent flagstone is about the same height., Don't do anything else until your mortar is completely dry.

, Fill the spaces between the flagstones with sand, gravel, additional mortar, or grout.


Grout can be purchased at any home improvement store. Follow the instructions on the bag to mix the grout.
Using a tool called a float, also available at your local home improvement store, press the grout between your flagstones, then immediately do a second pass with the float to remove excess. After the grout sits for 15-30 minutes, wipe up the remaining excess grout with water and a large sponge, changing the water often. Afterward, wipe the stones with a dry towel to remove remaining mud.If you wish, you can change the color of your grout prior to application with mineral dyes (available at most home improvement stores) or even acrylic paint. It is recommended that you experiment with a small batch before dyeing the grout you'll actually use on your flagstones, in case you don't like the final look.For sand or gravel joints, just pour the filler on your flagstones and sweep it into the joints with a broom.

, If you used grout or mortar in your joints, wait for it to completely dry (this may take as long as a couple of days) and then cover them with a matte or glossy sealer (available at your hardware store). This prevents water and/or ice from getting into the joints and damaging them.You can apply the sealer with cotton swabs or a disposable paint brush.


If you used sand or gravel in your joints, there is no need to seal them.
Sealing your joints is optional but highly recommended, especially if you live in a place that gets a lot of rainfall or cold winters."

Check with a utility company before digging.,
Draw up your plan.,
Choose a pattern.,
Clear away grass and debris.,
Mark the outline of the area.",How to Install Paving Stones1," Call a local utility company to ask about the location of cables and pipes. If there are any present underneath the planned paving stone area, you may need to change your design.;
, Draw a plan of the area and measure it to determine the amount of paving stone supplies you need. For drainage purposes, plan to install the paving stones with a slight slope away from the house, between 1/4"" (6mm) per foot (0.3m) and 1/2"" (12mm) per foot (0.3 m).Purchase 5 percent more paving stones than you need to allow for cutting, or 10 percent more if your plan includes many curves or irregular shapes., Plan your desired layout before you purchase the stones, so you're sure you'll be able to build a pattern you like. In general, the more ""interlocking"" there is, the stronger the pattern will be, making the herringbone pattern a good option for vehicle traffic. Mostly, however, this is an aesthetic decision. Choices for layout include:

""Bricklaying"": Lay out the paving stones in an offset grid, so the bottom of each paving stone touches two paving stones underneath it. This tends to look better than a simple grid, and may reduce sliding.
Herringbone: Form an arrow shape by placing two rectangular paving stones at right angles to each other. ""Nest"" more of these arrows in a long diagonal line under each other, and use similar lines of arrows to fill the remaining space.
Even if your basic pattern only involves one shape of paving stone, you could purchase a second, smaller shape to create a border.

, Remove plants, fallen leaves, and other surface cover from the area so you can clearly see the area you'll be working with. If more intensive preparation is required, such as breaking up concrete, make sure you follow safe practices, and consider hiring a professional.

, Stake the corners of the area you want paved, and tie string taut between the strings to mark the border.

Remove loose residue from the asphalt surface.,
Soak the asphalt with a steady stream of water.,
Pre-treat oil stains and tire marks before attempting to clean the entire surface.,
Mix the cleaning product in a bucket.,
Work the cleaner into the asphalt.,
Rinse the asphalt.",How to Clean Asphalt," Use the oblong push broom to sweep away leaves, grass cuttings, loose dirt and other residue that is lightly resting on the surface. Removing all loose dirt and grime will make the task of actually cleaning the asphalt much easier.;
, Use the garden hose to apply the water over the surface. Taking the time to thoroughly moisten the surface of the asphalt before beginning the cleaning phase will help loosen some of the minor residue that may be embedded in small crevices in the surface of the asphalt, making the overall cleaning effort a little easier.

, Accomplish this by coating the heavier stained areas with laundry detergent. Pour a generous amount of the powdered detergent directly onto oil and similar stains. Allow the detergent to set for several minutes, soaking into the wet surface and beginning the task of lifting oil and other stains from the top layer of the asphalt.

, Combine 1 part laundry detergent with 3 parts water and 1 part bleach. Make sure the combination is mixed thoroughly.

, Pour some of the cleaner onto a section of the asphalt, and then use the hand brush to work the product into the asphalt. Use a combination of clockwise, counter-clockwise and back and forth movements to work the bristles into the surface of the asphalt. This will help dislodge any residue that is continued to remain adhered to the surface.

, As the final phase of the asphalt cleaning, use a high pressure stream of water from the hose to rinse away the cleaner and the dislodged dirt and grime. Survey the condition of the surface and take note of any lingering stains or surface grime. Administer additional cleaning product and brush vigorously before rinsing the area a second time.

If your driveway touches any doors or walls, cover them with a tarp or some painter's tape. This will protect them from any debris that may fly around while you are pressure washing.Check to see which end of your driveway is the highest and what direction the water will flow while you are washing.
It is best if your water is absorbed by your lawn. If the water drains into a storm drain, you will be introducing chemicals into your local water supply.;
, Oil and antifreeze stains are the stains you will most likely have on your driveway. Before you use a pressure washer, apply a degreaser to the stain.Allow the degreaser to sit on the stain for five to 10 minutes to soak up the stain.


Use the degreaser at full strength for older stains that have penetrated your driveway. Dilute the degreaser with water for newer stains.Follow the dilution instructions on the degreaser bottle. The dilution ratio will vary depending on the product that you use.
Once you have allowed the degreaser to sit, scrub it into the stain using a stiff brush.

, Typically you will use a pressure hose to connect the spray wand to the washer and connect the washer to a garden hose. The setup may vary depending on the pressure washer that you are using. Always read the instructions before you set up the pressure washer.The pressure washer comes with both low pressure and high pressure nozzles.
If your cleaning a brick driveway, do not use the high pressure nozzle at all.

, The instructions that come with your pressure washer will tell you what type of detergent you should use. Only use detergents that have been formulated to use with a pressure washer.Use the low pressure nozzle to apply the detergent to your driveway. Point the nozzle downward and move back and forth over your driveway. Allow the detergent to sit on your driveway for 15 minutes.Do not allow the detergent to dry on your driveway. If you notice that is getting dried out, apply some water to your driveway.
Do not add bleach to your pressure washer because the bleach may cause damage to the washer.Start at the higher end of the driveway and move in the direction that water flows.

, After fifteen minutes, use the high pressure nozzle to wash away the detergent. Make sure you set the pressure washer to rinse mode. Use the same pattern you used when you were applying the detergent.Be sure to wash away all of the detergent.
Pay extra attention to the heavily stained, dirtier areas of your driveway.
You can use a surface cleaner attachment for more effective cleaning. If you use this attachment, do a final rinse without the attachment one all of the detergent and dirt are gone."

, In order to determine how many pavers you need to purchase, you need to know how many square feet your total path will be. Multiply the length by the width to get that number.

, You can shop for pavers specials online or visit your local hardware store. Make sure to also purchase gravel for the base and sand filler.

, You need to excavate the pathway area 8"" deep, prior to laying the base.

, The gravel should be 4 to 6"" deep and needs to be tightly compacted. The base gives your pavers additional strength and durability.

, The pavers can be arranged in a variety of patterns. You can purchase interlocking pavers, natural stone pavers, smooth pavers, tumbled pavers, and more. There is an unlimited variety, allowing for ultimate design creativity.

, Sand filler is a fantastic material because it also allows the pavers to flex or shift slightly, making them earthquake resistant.

, Once your pavers are clean make sure there is enough sand filler in between each paver. Pour more if needed.

Use a high quality shovel.,
Shovel frequently.,
Shovel correctly to avoid hurting yourself.,
Watch where you put it.,
Research regulations.",How to Clear Snow and Ice from Pavements and Public Spaces1," It will be easier to use a shovel that is made out of light plastic or has an aluminum blade and is covered with a nonstick finish.


This will make it easier to load and unload the snow. You don’t want a shovel that’s too big or that contains softer materials.
You won’t have to bend as much if you choose a shovel with a S-shaped shaft.
You can use a shovel with a C-shaped blade, called a pusher, on lighter, fluffier snow that doesn’t weigh as much.
You can apply lubricant to help your shovel move more easily through the snow. Options include non-stick cooking spray, W-D 40, paraffin wax or other similar products. Before applying, make sure your shovel is dry and warm. You can reapply as necessary.;
, Don’t wait until the storm is over because the snow and ice will have a chance to bond to the pavement, making it harder to remove later. You could always pay a neighbor kid to shovel for you.The key to success when having to remove snow by hand is to start as soon as possible.
You should shovel several times during a storm. It’s also easier to shovel less early fallen snow than thicker deeper snow, so do the shoveling in parts. Avoid heaping the snow against foundation walls, where it can melt, refreeze, and cause problems.
You want to shovel down to the pavement so that the sun’s rays will hopefully hit it and stop ice from forming on the pavement or public space. Another reason to remove the snow right away is because it will be harder to do so once it’s packed down by foot traffic or vehicles.

, You can easily strain your back or knees when shoveling. However, there are ways to prevent this. It's important not to overload the shovel; work with manageable amounts of snow. Focus on pushing the snow instead of lifting it whenever possible, and take plenty of breaks.When you have to lift a load of snow, squat and lift using the power of your legs. Keep your back straight. Avoid jackknifing your body and lifting from your lower back, will save you from getting a back injury.Make sure the shovel is long enough. If you're trying to use a shovel that's too short for your height, you will increase the chances you will strain your back.You want to pick a shovel length where the blade will touch the ground, requiring you to only slightly bend your knees and so you don't have to lean forward a lot. The shovel's handle should be at chest length if you were to stand the shovel on its end.
Keep the bottom edge of your shovel in good condition by by using a hand file or bench grinder to smooth out any dents or rough edges.

, It’s not a good idea to just shovel snow into the street or to whip it into your neighbor’s lawn. Be respectful of others. You should also be careful not to block drains.


Putting snow into the street can cause a driving hazard for motorists. Shoveling it from your driveway into the sidewalk can run afoul of city ordinances.
It’s a better idea to shovel it from the pavement onto the yard itself. You’re not going to be able to use it in the midst of a deep winter anyway. You want to make sure you don’t create another hazard in the process of removing one.
Plan ahead at the beginning of the winter to determine where you will shovel your snow. Snow storage has to last all winter, so planning ahead will save time and energy.

, It may be that you have no choice and will have to clear the public areas that are adjacent to your property. Check with your municipality.Some municipalities require homeowners or business owners to clear snow and ice from the sidewalks that are adjacent to their buildings. Some municipalities even have rules about how fast you must clear the snow and ice from the sidewalk area.
You can face a fine in some municipalities if you don’t do so, as well as facing potential liability in slip-and-fall cases. It’s not worth it, so do your homework!
You should also be careful about volunteering to shovel pavement or public spaces on property you don’t own and that aren’t adjacent to your property. It could potentially open you up to liability if someone slips and falls. Also be mindful of water runoff when snow melts. "

Excavate the area.,
Pour in and compact gravel in stages.,
Add landscape fabric (optional).,
Add a layer of sand.,
Screed the sand.",How to Install Paving Stones2," You'll need to dig deep enough to reach a stable surface beneath the topsoil, and often deeper to ensure the stones have solid support. Large installation projects may require an excavator, and a square shovel is always useful for creating the vertical walls.


For a driveway or other area with heavy car or machinery traffic, dig 7–9 inches (18–23 centimeters) deep, plus the height of the paving stones you'll be installing.
For a walkway with only foot traffic, you only need to dig 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) deep, plus the height of the stones.

, Use crushed rock or gravel sized at about ¾ of an inch (1.9 cm). This will provide a base for the paving stones, and allow water to drain through. Rent or purchase a plate compactor, and use it to compact the gravel to make a stable, sturdy base. You may need to pour in the gravel in stages, as each compactor has a maximum depth that it can compact at one time.The final layer should be 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) deep for areas with car or machinery traffic, or up to 12 in. (30 cm) in wet soil.
Use a layer 3–4 inches (7.5–10 cm) deep for walkways.

, Some people install landscape fabric or geotextiles over the gravel at this stage. This helps prevent weed growth, and may help keep the base above it in place.However, other installers prefer to skip this step, as it is not a permanent weed solution and may lead to drainage problems in the long term., Pour in a 1 inch (2.5 cm) layer of sand to keep the paving stones in place. This sand is sold as ""bedding sand"" or ""paver sand.""

, Place a bubble level on top of a flat 2 x 4 or screed board. Scrape it over the surface of the sand, taking care to avoid stepping on the sand layer. The sand should be flat, but along a slight slope, between 1/4"" (6mm) per foot (0.3m) and 1/2"" (12mm) per foot (0.3 m).

Install edge restraints.,
Lay out the paving stones.,
Cut and install edge pieces if necessary.,
Compact the paving stones.,
Fill in the gaps with sand.,
Clean and seal.",How to Install Paving Stones3," These are sturdy objects made from plastic, metal, concrete or wood, intended to prevent the sand and paving stones from drifting out of the prepared area. Lay these out along the edge of the sand bed, pressing them down.


If the soil is poor or the paving stones will receive heavy traffic, consider pouring concrete edges instead.

, Place the stones on the sand gently, with a narrow gap in between them. Do not press or tamp them into the sand, and take care not to walk over the sand during installation.


A few basic patterns were described in the planning section above.

, If any paving stones need cutting, use a masonry saw or splitter. Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from chips. If you cannot access these tools, a heavy hammer and masonry chisel can be used to create rough splits.

, Make several passes over the paving stones with a plate compactor to press them into the sand bed. Repeat until the stones are level and flat., Pour sand over the paving stones and sweep it into the cracks until a level, stable surface is created.


For a more solid, weed-resistant filler, use polymeric sand instead, then water it gently with a hose to activate the binding.

, Sweep any excess sand and dirt off the area. Apply a paver sealer to the joints to extend the life of your pavers and increase their overall durability.

"
"
Apply a natural absorbent.,
Apply cola to the stain.,
Use dishwasher detergent.",How to Clean a Driveway2," Cat litter, corn starch, cornmeal, or baking soda be used to remove oil and gasoline from your driveway. Cover the stain with one of these products and allow it to sit for at least an hour. If the stain was wet when you applied the absorbent, the absorbent will soak up the oil or gasoline. Use a broom to sweep up the absorbent.If the stain was dry when you applied the absorbent, wet the stain with water and scrub it with a stiff brush and a paste (i.e. 3 parts baking soda to 1 part water). Then rinse the area with water and let it air dry.
You may have to repeat this process more than once.

, Pour two cans of room temperature cola on the stain and let it sit overnight. Blot the stain with a towel in the morning and rinse the stain with water.It is best to rinse the area with a hose so that you can apply pressure to the area.


You can also scrub the cola into the stain with a stiff brush.
If you cannot let the cola sit overnight, let it soak for at least an hour before you spray the area with water., Wet the area with the stain and sprinkle dish-washing detergent (i.e. powdered detergent) all over. Make sure the area is completely covered with detergent. While the detergent is sitting on the stain, boil a large pot of water. Once the water begins to boil, pour it over the stain and scrub it with a stiff-bristled brush. Rinse the area with water once you are finished.You can use baking soda instead of dish-washing detergent.
Repeat this process as many times as you need to.

"
"
Make a poultice.,
Use an enzymatic cleaner.,
Use a professional cleaner.",How to Clean a Driveway3," Combine an absorbent material (e.g. kitty litter or sawdust) with a solvent (e.g. acetone, xylene, or lacquer thinner) until the paste has the consistency of peanut butter. Spread the poultice over the stained area. It should be 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Cover the area with plastic and let it sit for approximately 24 hours.The solvent will break down the oil and the absorbent will suck the oil out of the driveway.


This can be an expensive option if you have a large are to cover with the poultice.Use other methods before you try a poultice or any other chemical cleaner.
Always wear gloves and protective eye wear if you are working with chemicals.

, These cleaners are also known as oxidation cleaners. You can purchase them at your local hardware store, home-improvement store, or a janitorial supply store. These chemicals do not require much work. All you have to do is apply them to the stain and let them work.No water or scrubbing is required with these cleaners. The enzymes and/or bacteria in the cleaner will destroy the stain.
Always follow the instructions that come with the cleaner that you purchase.
These cleaners usually take days or weeks to remove the stain. You may have to reapply for larger stains.
A cleaner like this is great for removing pet urine stains.

, If all else has failed, consult a professional cleaner to treat your driveway. A professional may use muriatic acid or some other chemicals to clean your driveway.A professional can also seal your driveway to protect it from future spills, dirt and other damage.Shop around for a good price before you choose a professional.
This is a more expensive option, but it can save you money in the long run.

Use a snowblower.,
Call a snow removal service.,
Install a snow melt mat.",How to Clear Snow and Ice from Pavements and Public Spaces2," If you have a large area to clear, and you need to do it fast, it will be a lot easier if you have a snowblower.


This machine is a good alternative to shoveling when there’s at least 1 ½ inches of snow on the pavement or public space.
Move up and down the length of the pavement. Try to point the snowblower's chute downwind if you can. Work in circles so the chute will throw snow to different sides. Before you use the snowblower, spray its exit chute with furniture polish or silicone. This will stop the snow from sticking. When snow blowing, throw the snow as far into the yard as you can so it doesn't stack up too high on the edges.
After you buy the snowblower, read the owner’s manual. Make sure you are using the correct fuel in it because, if you don’t, you could harm the engine. For example, some engines can’t tolerate gas with too much ethanol in it.Don’t leave the fuel sitting in the tank if you’re not going to use it for more than 30 days. It can damage the fuel system because it will deteriorate inside of it. If you’re concerned about the environment, it’s possible to purchase an electric snowblower instead of using a gas-powered machine.
Follow all the machine’s operating and safety instructions properly. The debris dispersed by snowblowers can break house or car windows, if thrown powerfully enough. Never stick your hand or a tool of any kind into the machine with it running.

, If you’re dealing with a big or tricky public space or pavement area, you might want to call a service that specializes in snow removal. Most Landscape companies in heavy snowfall regions offer snow- and ice-management services.


Don’t wait too long into a storm or the service may already be booked up. You will have to pay a fee depending on the property. Start booking snow removal services in mid-September if you know you will need it.
Ask about any “roll-out minimums,” meaning the minimum level of snowfall for which they will dispatch clearing services. Also inquire as to their procedures during heavy snowfall. For example, do they come multiples times or just once.
Snow removal services have equipment with plows so it will be a lot easier for them to clear a large area. You should be able to find these services online in your area, through word-of-mouth, or in the phone book. Prices will vary depending on where you live, but it can cost as little as $30-45 to clear a driveway size area.

, This means that you install electric wires in the pavement in order to heat it from below. This will melt snow as it falls.


People lay down these wires when they are installing or replacing a driveway, usually. They will have to pay for electricity costs, though.
The way this works is that the electrical wires radiate heat upwards, melting the snow, so you don’t have to shovel it! This is most feasible on your own property's pavement.
Radiant fluid systems are another option and may prove to be a safer, more user-friendly choice in heavy snowfall regions.

Use liquid magnesium chloride blend.,
Use rock salt.,
Try calcium chloride.,
Put sand or kitty litter on the icy area.",How to Clear Snow and Ice from Pavements and Public Spaces3," Apply this chemical to the pavement or public space with a garden sprayer before the storm hits. It’s best to apply this a couple hours before a winter storm.The chemical will melt snowfalls that are less than two inches. It will also keep ice from adhering to hard surfaces like pavement or public spaces.
You can also apply deicers during a snowfall after you’ve removed the first layer of snow.
You should expect to use about 1 gallon of the chemical for every 1,000 square feet of pavement. You should be able to buy it at hardware stores.
Chemicals can be very toxic to plants and animals. Follow all directions, and consider other methods if you have pets or expensive landscaping.

, Rock salt works at temperatures that are above 12 degrees Fahrenheit, although it’s not a good idea to put it on concrete or grass. You can purchase rock salt, otherwise known as sodium chloride, at many gas stations or grocery stores.


Store the rock salt in a sealed bucket, and spread it around the public space or pavement with a handheld spreader or a push spreader. It will melt the ice and prevent the area from being a hazard for slipping. Use about a handful for every square yard.
If you’re not a fan of salt, you could try urea, which is usually used as a fertilizer and performs the same function as rock salt. It can be hard to find, though. The key is to find a deicer. Alfalfa meal is another fertilizer that helps melt snow.
One downside of rock salt is that it can harm plants or pets, and it doesn’t really work if the temperature is below 25 degrees. It can also leach into soil.

, Calcium chloride pellets melt ice faster than rock salt does, and they have some other advantages as a deicer.Calcium chloride is effective with colder temperatures than rock salt. It works with temperatures of up to minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
Calcium chloride can be harmful to pets or animals, and it costs a lot more than rock salt, though. It also can cause a surface to become slippery.
Prolonged use of chemical snow melt can damage concrete and asphalt, if used to excess. Treat sparingly.

, While this won’t remove the ice per se, if you’re having a hard time getting it off the pavement, it’s a better option than risking a fall.


The sand and kitty litter work because they add traction to icy surfaces. They make it less likely that a person will fall. The downside of kitty litter is that it will still be there and look messy when the snow melts.
You want to choose sandbox sand that is thicker instead of mason’s sand because mason’s sand is too fine. You could also use bird seed for this same purpose.

Replace broken windows.,
Consider installing double glazed windows.,
Patch gaps in the roof, siding and around the foundation.,
Examine the shed during rainfall, to see if any water is leaking in.,
Consider siding the shed if there are a lot of gaps.,
Buy a weatherproof door.,
Get the shed fitted with electrical wiring if you want to install a heating system or lights.,
Measure the space between the studs.,
Pick blanket or batt insulation if your studs are 18 to 24 inches (45.7 to 61.0 cm) apart.,
Move to foam board or polystyrene sheets if the studs are not a standard length but they are at regular intervals.,
Choose wool insulation if you need an insulation that can withstand high temperatures.,
Choose foam, loose fill or spray insulation if the shed walls are already finished with drywall.,
Select reflective foil-faced insulation if you want a do-it-yourself insulation on a standard frame.,
Hire a professional contractor if you choose blown-in in or foam insulation.,
Take your shed measurements into the home improvement store.,
Roll the sheets of batting or foil out horizontally.,
Attach batting or with staple gun if you are using foil sheets or batting.,
Overlap sheets of insulation where they meet.,
Insulate the ceiling as well as the walls.,
Cover the insulation sheets with sheets of drywall if you want the shed interior to be attractive.",How to Insulate a Shed," There is no use insulating the walls if the windows are gapped or broken.;
, If you are going to use it for a guest room or home office, this is essential, since single glazed windows will allow a large amount of heat loss and depending on which side your shed faces, let a lot of heat in during summer.

, Seal thin gaps with caulk. Use expandable spray foam for larger holes.

, Install a roof with a good drainage system. You can use shingles, metal roofing or fiberglass.


In the absence of rain, use a garden hose and spray it over the roof. Look inside for signs of leakage., Filling holes and establishing a barrier between the outside is important if you are going to keep the temperature constant inside the shed. Look for dark stains in the walls to identify water leaks in the shed.

, Most shed kits don’t come with a weatherproof model. You may need to purchase a custom size if your shed door is smaller than a standard home door.

, Hire an electrician to ensure it will be safe. Extension cords from the house are not safe.

, This space will dictate the width of the sheets or batting you are going to buy.

, These standard wall sizes allow for you to roll out and secure the insulation between studs, joists and beams. It is relatively expensive and best on unfinished walls.

, They are fairly thin but work well, although they are not recommended if you have a lot of electrical outlets.

, Keep in mind that wool will need regular upkeep and maintenance. Without proper cleaning, wool will break down and rot over time from its natural dirt and oils. Although fiberglass insulation is a similar option, it must be covered or it is unsafe for humans.

, You can cut holes into the walls and blow the insulation into the frame., It is flexible, so that it can bend around corners or other obstructions., Some of these methods require special equipment.

, They should help you to purchase enough to cover the shed. They will require your stud spacing measurements as well.

, Set the polystyrene against the frame.

, Staple it into the studs.You will need to glue polystyrene sheets onto the walls and studs with a special adhesive.

, Continue moving up the wall in horizontal sheets. You can cut the insulation sheets with scissors to make a smaller section.

, You will need to leave at least a two-inch gap between the top of the ceiling and the insulation to let moisture escape.

, You will want to hang the sheets on the ceiling first, followed by wall sheets."

Check the rules of the neighborhood.,
Check the local laws.,
Verify what the exact required setback are from your property’s boundaries.,
Identify underground sprinkler heads and connecting pipes, be aware you may need to move piping or sprinklers.,
Consider what you want to store now and in the future, build accordingly.,
Use supplies that will protect against your region’s weather.,
Assess your surrounding landscape, thinking 3-4-5 years out … are there trees or other foliage whose growth may crowd easy access to and from your shed.,
Consider the position of the shed as you measure space – if swinging doors are part of your shed plans, can the doors open and shut fully, unhindered within the shed zone?,
Decide on windows.,
Be sure the ground is level.",How to Prepare to Build a Shed," Check into any neighborhood restrictions or requirements. Simple things such as roof choice, color or visibility from the road can be addressed much easier in your planning phase.;
, Before you begin construction check your local laws … contact your town’s local building department, see if a building permit is required. Or, check to see if there are specific zoning restrictions or requirements.

, Know the official boundary and get the set back requirements in writing from the official source.

, Do not build your shed on top of an underground sprinkler systems.

,


Draw a schematic of how things will fit.
Make a list and view the actual items. Nothing is worse than outgrowing your well-built shed after a single season. Or, building a shed for specific items that comfortably fit.

, Snow? Plan for a sturdy roof. Heavy Rains? High Humidity? Use the best materials for regional conditions and you won't be rebuilding prematurely.

, The last thing you’ll want is to cut down your wife’s favorite dogwood tree in 4 years… you know, the little one she just planted?

, It’s surprising the number of projects that don’t account for the full distance of a wide-open door.

, Will your shed offer windows? Consider the position of the sun and if you want the benefit of natural light inside your shed, a great benefit even if your shed will boast electric lights.

, Level ground sounds like an obvious requirement that shouldn’t need mentioning. That being said, not all obviously looking flat ground is level. Be sure to actually measure for levelness and address any minor issues needed. Overtime, un-level ground will be a regretted nuisance.

Secure the shed structure.,
Dig under the shed so you can place jacks to lift it.,
Jack the shed up to the minimum necessary height.",How to Move a Shed1," Sheds are made to be sturdy on the ground, not while being lifted, pushed, or pulled. Taking time beforehand to support weak points will save you a lot of trouble during and after the move.Remove any windows. Any shifting or warping of the structure could break them.
Help the shed keep its shape by attaching boards with nails or screws into the studs from corner to corner on each wall, and in an X pattern across the floor. Add additional diagonal supports across window and door openings, as these are weak points during a move.;
, Either dig four access holes at each corner, or (for smaller sheds only) two access holes in the middle of opposite sides. Dig only as much as is needed to place your chosen jack securely under the shed frame.You may be able skip the digging and tip and lift a smaller shed to fit the jack underneath, especially if it is sitting on a concrete or brick pad. If so, make sure you support the structural integrity first and tip and lift with extreme caution.

, In the best-case scenario, you’ll have multiple jacks so that you can lift the entire structure all at once. More realistically, though, you’ll probably have to jack up one side, prop it up securely with blocks or lumber, then relocate the jack and continue the lift. An automobile jack is a good choice for this job.If you’re going to move the shed by dragging it on a makeshift wooden sled, you won’t have to jack it up very high. If you’re rolling it on pipes, you’ll need to lift it a bit higher, and if you’re putting it on a trailer hitched to a truck, even higher still.
Jack up the shed only as high as necessary. The higher it is raised, the more careful you need to be. Make sure all jacks and supports are level, secure, and supporting the structure.
You can also make repairs to damaged or rotted areas at the bottom of the shed while it’s securely lifted off the ground.

Start with a basic clean-up.,
Spray the concrete with cleaner.,
Scrub the floor.,
Rinse the floor.,
Repair cracks.,
Protect other surface areas.,
Mix your primer.,
Prime the edges of your floor first.,
Switch to your paint roller.,
Coat the whole floor.,
Read the paint's instructions regarding weather.,
Mix and pour the paint.,
Cut in.,
Paint the floor strip by strip.,
Add color flakes if you like.,
Apply a second coat if desired.",How to Paint a Garage Floor," Wipe up any liquids (such as automotive fluids or any other chemicals) with a cloth. Then clear the floor of dry debris. Sweep up any dust or solids with a broom.If your concrete floor is brand new, extensive cleaning shouldn’t be necessary. However, you must wait at least 30 days after the concrete is poured before it has cured enough to be painted.;
, For best results, use an all-in-one concrete cleaner and etcher made specifically for concrete and masonry. Since these will most likely come in a jug-like container, pour the liquid through a funnel in a plastic spray bottle. Spray it over the whole floor, using generous amounts over noticeable stains. Let it sit for at least ten minutes. For heavy stains, let it soak for twenty.Laundry detergent and TSP (trisodium phosphate) can also be used as cleaner.Do not combine different products, though, since their ingredients may cause harmful chemical reactions.

, Allow the cleaner enough time to sit, but not enough to dry. While the floor is still wet, scrub the concrete with a stiff-bristled brush or broom. Use non-metal bristles, since metal ones may scratch up the concrete.If stains persist despite heavy scrubbing, spray with more cleaner and repeat as needed.

, Attach a high-pressure nozzle to your garden hose. Spray the entire floor, working from the inside outward. Wash away any traces of cleaner and debris.Once you are finished, mop or squeegee the extra water out of the garage. Allow the floor to air-dry before proceeding.


Alternately, use a power washer. Some models enable you to mix cleaners with water, which would allow you to use it instead of a spray bottle when applying cleaner., Before you prime your floor, inspect it for any imperfections. Apply a concrete/mortar compound over any thin cracks. For wider cracks, use a concrete patch. If the they are especially deep, apply the new concrete in layers, allowing each to dry before adding the next.Skim extra concrete off the top before it dries to keep the surface area smooth and level.

, Line the bottoms of your walls with painter’s tape where they meet the floor. Layer plastic sheeting, dropcloth, newspapers, or some other protective covering over the walls. Safeguard them from any splashes of primer or paint.

, Expect the ingredients in your primer to separate as it settled after being sealed. Use a paint stirrer to recombine them. Stir vigorously until it is evenly mixed again., Pick a corner to start from. Pour some primer into a tray or bucket. Then use a paint brush to apply it along the floor, where it meets the wall. Create a border that is roughly 2 to 3 inches thick (5 to 7.5 cm) along all four sides of your floor.This technique is often referred to as “cutting in.”

, Once the border has been primed, pour more primer into a paint tray. Screw an extension pole into the base of a paint roller so you don’t have to work on your knees. Roll the roller in the tray to load it with primer, and begin rolling the primer on the floor, starting in a back corner of the garage.When you start, apply more primer directly over your border, rather than starting right beside it.
Cover a length of floor about 4 feet (1 m) long and 2 feet wide (1.2 m long and 0.6 m wide) at a time before freshening the roller with more primer.
When you begin rolling again, overlap the previous length by a little bit to ensure there isn’t a gap between the two.

, Keep rolling lengths of primer over the floor until the entire surface is treated.As you go, be aware of your exit strategy so you don’t back yourself into a corner. Starting from the back of the garage, work your way from left to right. Then back up toward the open garage door, and work your way from left to right again. Repeat until you finally exit the garage.


Once you are done, refer to the primer’s directions to find out how long it need to dry. Some may recommend four hours. Others may recommend longer. If you are unable to paint the floor on the same day, don't worry. Just be sure to do so within the next 30 days. After that long, you would need to prime the floor again., Once your floor is primed, refer to your paint's directions before you begin painting. Be aware that temperatures and humidity can impact the paint before, during, and after application. Save yourself the trouble of having to redo your floors because the first coat was applied in less than ideal conditions., Expect the paint’s color to be inconsistent when you first open it. Use a paint stirrer to mix it until the color is perfectly even. After that, pour some into a paint tray or bucket.When choosing a paint, decide between latex acrylic or epoxy. Be sure to buy paint specifically designed for concrete. To save money in the short-term, pick latex acrylic, which will last about two years before needing a new coat. For a paint job that will last longer and resist more damage, use epoxy, which will last about four years.If you are unsure of how much paint to buy, kits are available for standard-sized garages (1-car, 2-car, etc.).Alternately, measure the square footage and ask staff at the store how much you will need, or use an online paint calculator to determine this yourself.

, Start off the same way you applied the primer. Choose a corner to be your starting point. Use a brush to paint a strip roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) wide along the edges of the floor., Again, simply use the same process as priming. Fill your paint tray with paint. Using a roller with an extension pole, paint the floor on strip at a time. Starting in a back corner, cover the freshly painted border with a length of paint roughly 4 feet (1 m) long by 2 feet wide (1.2 m long by 0.6 m wide). Freshen your roller with more paint and paint another strip that slightly overlaps the first.As before, start at the back of the garage and work from side to side before moving backward toward the garage door.

, Consider adding vinyl chips to liven up the floor's base coat with complement colors. If you decide to do so, empty the chips from their packaging into a bucket or similar container before you start painting. Keep the bucket handy as you paint. Once you have a sizable area covered, toss handfuls of chips into the air over it so they can settle at random into the drying paint. Be sure to do this no later than ten minutes after the paint was applied, so the chips can stick to the wet coat.Always toss the chips upward, rather than directly at the floor. This will help to disperse over a wider area, instead of in clumps.
Before you begin painting, do a test run with your chips once your primer has dried. Be sure that you have have enough to cover the entire floor. Also, practice your tosses so you don't end up using all your flakes before the end due to poor dispersal.
If you plan on doing a second coat of paint, wait until then before applying your flakes.

, Give the first coat 24 hours to dry. After that, give it a gander and determine whether you want to apply a second coat. If you do, simply repeat the process. If not, feel free to begin walking over the first coat as long as it no longer feels tacky, but give it another week before parking your car or other heavy machinery inside.If you do a second coat, be aware that many experts recommend applying second coats in a perpendicular fashion to the first. For example, if you rolled from the back of the garage toward the door, you should then roll from one side of the garage to the other during the second coat.
However, the confines of your garage might not allow you to do this so easily. In this case, just apply the second coat in the same exact fashion as the first.

Clean your garage.,
Wear personal protective equipment.,
Ventilate the garage.,
Mix a 3-1 solution of bleach and water to soak and scrub the floor.,
Pick your garage floor paint color and purchase the amount necessary to get the job done.,
Apply a coat of primer after the floor is completely dry and ready.",How to Paint a Garage1," This means power washing the outside and scrubbing the inside. If you are painting the garage floor as well, there are a lot of other things you need to do to prepare that surface. The last thing you want is to spend a lot of time and sweat painting your garage only to see the paint peeling and looking ragged next season. Do it right the first time.

, This means goggles and chemical resistant gloves and boots. You will need some pretty strong stuff to get that oil off the old concrete and get it ready to accept a coat of paint.

, The overhead garage door should be open, at least at the cleaning phase. If it is too windy, opening it up 6-8 inches (15.24 - 20.32 cm)should be sufficient to ventilate, but keep the outside from coming in and sticking to your new floor.

, Let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing. Make sure you rinse it well when you are done. Seal up any cracks and repair any damage to the concrete after the water has evaporated.

, By the time you get this all together, the crack repair and sealant should be completely dry. If not, give it more time. It has to be completely dry before you put down the paint. You may have to etch the floor if it is newer or does not readily absorb water. If it doesn't absorb water, it is not going to absorb the paint.

, A primer will make your floor look 100 percent better and make it last longer. It is worth the time, effort and extra money. After at least 1 day, when the primer is completely dried, you can apply your paint. Make sure with both your priming and your top coat, you start from the back of the garage and work your way to the front so you can exit without walking over your masterpiece.

"
"
Prepare pipes and tracks.,
Roll, reposition, and repeat.,
Reverse the lifting process.",How to Move a Shed2," If you’re moving the shed across your yard, you can roll it on a “conveyor belt” of sturdy pipes. Choose pipes that are longer than the shed and sturdy enough to hold its weight (but not too heavy for you and a friend to lift and move). Large-diameter PVC pipe will often work for smaller sheds.Three pipes are often sufficient for smaller sheds. Space out the pipes beneath the shed (to support its weight) and perpendicular to the direction you’ll be moving (so they can roll forward in that direction).
Especially if you’re moving the shed over soft ground, use two pairs of long, wide boards as tracks over which to roll the pipes. Lay them out like railroad tracks pointing in the direction you’re heading; place one pair beneath the pipes and shed, and one pair in front of that.

, If your shed is still jacked up over the rolling pipes, carefully ease it down onto them. Then, slowly push the shed in the direction you want to go. You’ll almost certainly need additional assistance, with the number of helpers depending on the size of the shed. It’s better (and safer) to have too much help than too little.As you push the shed forward, the pipe nearest to you will “pop out” from underneath the shed. Carry it around to the front and roll the shed onto it. You will repeat this process over and again until you reach your destination.
If you are using wooden tracks underneath the pipes, reposition them as you go as well. Think of it as laying a railroad track in front of a (slowly) moving train by ripping up and reusing the tracks now behind the train.

, Once you reach your destination, you may be able to simply push a smaller shed off of the pipes and into place. Especially if the shed is larger or not overly sturdy, it is probably best to utilize your jacks and supports to ease it back down into place.Make sure the destination is prepared and level.
Make sure the shed is still level and square as you remove the braces and prepare it for use again. Make repairs as needed.

"
"
Place the shed on a trailer.,
Drag the shed on a sled.,
Use a forklift or a crane.",How to Move a Shed3," If you are moving your shed farther than across your property, you’ll have to place it securely in a vehicle trailer. If possible to do so safely, jack the shed up high enough that you can simply slide it onto the trailer. Otherwise, you will have to use the trailer’s ramp (or fashion your own) and employ a careful combination of pulling, pushing, and lifting to get the shed into place.Make sure the shed is centered on the trailer and secured properly with strong, snug strapping.
Cover any roof shingles with a secure tarp; high speeds can cause them to shear off. You may also want to cover any window openings with plywood, whether the windows have been removed or not.

, If you have a large yard and fairly level ground, you may want to drag the shed on a makeshift wooden sled, using the power of a pickup truck (or possibly a tractor for smaller sheds). If so, make sure you secure your pulling rope or chain around the shed, not to the sled, or the latter will simply be pulled out from underneath as the truck moves.Fashion the sled out of plywood sheets or a similarly thin, fairly smooth material. Make sure that it is larger than the base of the shed. The weight of the shed should pin the sled underneath while moving; otherwise, secure it to the shed structure with screws.
Wrap the tow line around the entire shed, about midway up the side walls. Latch, hook, or tie it on the side facing the back of the truck so that it is securely snug in place, then run the line and secure it to the vehicle’s tow hitch.
Drive slowly and steadily, avoiding lurches forward or quick stops. Have a couple of helpers keep an eye on the shed and help guide it as needed.

, If you have access to a forklift or a “mule” (a machine similar in appearance to a typical forklift), you can use one of these to relocate a secured and propped-up shed with relative ease. And, if you happen to be remodeling your home and there is a crane being used to lift roof trusses, etc., you can use it to quickly move the shed from your front yard to your back, for instance.Make sure you have been properly instructed in the safe use of such equipment before trying to move your shed with it.
Make sure the shed is properly secured to the machine with heavy-duty strapping.

"
"
Empty the shed.,
Plan and clear your path.,
Know your limits.,
Disassemble and reassemble the shed.",How to Move a Shed4," Yes, now is the time to empty out the shed and get rid of the junk you don’t need any more. Don’t try to save a bit of time by lifting and relocating a filled shed. Excess weight and shifting, unsecured materials are not conducive to a happy shed moving experience., Don’t pick up the shed first and then try to figure out where it’s going and how to get it there. Make sure there is a clear, open, sufficiently wide, relatively dry, and not-to-steep path between the shed’s present and intended locations. Clear, level, and prepare the shed’s “landing spot” in advance as well; lay down a concrete or brick pad if desired.Make sure there are no hanging tree branches in the way as well. And, depending upon the size of your shed, take special note of any electrical lines that might be in the way.

, If you are unsure of your ability to move a shed safely, either hire or follow the lead of someone who knows what they’re doing. You don’t want to destroy your shed while trying to lift or move it, and you certainly don’t want the shed falling on you due to improper lifting or securing.If the shed is proving too heavy to push, bring in some more helpers before continuing. Bribe your buddies with pizza and their beverages of choice afterward.
If you have electricity, water, or any other utilities running to the shed, hire a professional to make the disconnections.

, If the shed is simply too large and/or too fragile, your best option for salvaging and relocating it may be to tear it apart and rebuild it. Remember, that’s how London Bridge ended up in Arizona!Of course, you might also just decide it’s time for a new shed by this point.

Power wash the siding first.,
Decide on your color and purchase a paint that is compatible with the type of siding you have on your garage, whether it is aluminum, vinyl, cedar plank or some other substance.

,
Paint from the top down, preferably using a power paint sprayer, which is more efficient than a brush or a roller for this application.

Find good heating.",How to Live in a Garage," Garages tend to be dirty, dusty and oily. Remove all contaminated products and stains. Dust away and sweep up all sawdust shavings, dirt, and other unidentifiable stuff.


Remove all the junk, boxes and bicycles. You want to be able to get around; only keep what cannot be left out in the elements inside the garage.;
, Check if the walls and floor are damp. Dampness comes from the earth, leaky pipes, or rain. Damp causes mold which stinks (musty odours), wrecks your clothes and gives you a chronic cough because it's both a toxin and an allergen.


Consider whether it is possible to waterproof the outside.

,


Clean all the windows.

,, Add your chosen furniture and furnishings. If you're renovating, you might like to cover good items and store them while buying secondhand furniture for use in the garage. And if you've lost your items due to a disaster, secondhand furniture is a good option.


Shop at local flea markets to save money. Make sure all items are workable and clean.
Put all the furniture in the room. Arrange it so it can be roomy, functional, and not block other furniture.

, A shower can be linked to outside drainage to prevent the water accumulating in the garage.

, Partition off bedrooms if sharing with other people. Simply wooden walls will suffice for this, plus a door or curtain for the entry to each ""room"".

, A sink, stove, and eating table are essentials. Food preparation can be done on the table if there is no space for an additional bench.

, It will be a lot colder in the garage than in a house. All heating needs to be safe as a garage is easy to burn down. Electric heaters should be the sort that stop if tipped over, and all gas or wooden fires require flues to vent the toxic elements straight outside.

Build two parallel four foot fences, thirty feet long.,
Find the four end posts that will create the imaginary rectangle.,
Brace the posts when the positions are correct and the posts are plumb.,
Using a wheelbarrow, mix three sixty pound bags of concrete and water until you have a wet (but not watery) batch of concrete.,
Find the post with the highest ground elevation, and measure from the ground 4' up the post.,
Using your 10' pressure-treated 2”x4”s, cut them to the exact length between each post.,
Place intermediate 2”x4” members on 8' centers from one end post, so that they are able to accept the 4'x8' plywood panels.,
Paint the outside and top of the fence with a good outdoor primer and paint.

,
Cut 8 24” pieces from one of the fence top rails.,
Drill the holes with a drill press or a portable hand drill.,
From the center of the first post, mark along the wall every 10', and then mark a line using a framing square 22” down the wall.,
Secure the pipe to the wall using a 4” lag screw and a thick washer between the pipe and wall; do this in only the top hole – do not completely tighten.,
Once all the connectors and 118” top rail pipes have been connected, go back and secure the bottom lag screw and washer and tighten both.,
Gather four 56” top rail pipes and two end midway connectors and a peak connector.,
Add a 56” top rail pipe into the second wall connector (1,2).,
Unfold the cover in a large location so that it can accommodate the 20'x 30' size.,
Attach 30' ropes in three or four places along the length of the cover through the grommets.,
Pull each rope three or four feet, pulling the cover over the framework.,
Using a stepladder, secure the center of the cover at the frameworks peak, using a bungee ball at two locations.",How to Construct an Inexpensive Shelter," They need to have a distance of 13' 6” between the outside of the walls. In addition, make sure that they are exactly opposite each other so if there was an enclosure between each end, it would form a perfect rectangle. This means that the distance between diagonal opposite ends should be the same (32'11”).;
, Use 8' posts (you will cut the extra off after all posts have been placed). Dig the four corners a foot square, and two feet deep. Place the posts so that the outside of each post is 13'6” from the outside of the post on the other fence. The length outside of the post should be 30'. Place nails or screws in the end of the posts to lock them into the concrete.

, They should be braced in at least two directions. See photo.

, Fill the first hole and repeat the procedure for the three remaining holes. After setting overnight, fill in the intermediate post at 10' centers between the ends, using the above procedure.

, Mark that position with a felt tipped pen. Tie a string at the mark, and using a line level, mark each post at a position level with the first post. If this is done correctly, all the remaining posts will be greater than 4' off the ground. Cut excess post length off at the marks.

, Attach support blocks to each post so that the tops are 3'10.5” from the top of the post. You can also lay a scrap 2”x4” on top of the post and measure down 4'. Attach the bottom rails between the posts. Now attach the top rails.

, Attach the plywood to the sides, cutting the last panel to fit.

,, You can cut these yourself, or have the fence dealer make all the cuts for you, although they will charge you extra for this service. Two 1/4” holes must be drilled in each piece no closer than 7” from one end. Use a center punch to create a dimple to start the drill hole.

, Drill all the way through the pipe; making a smaller 1/8” hole first will make drilling the 1/4” hole easier.

, This is where the 24” top rail will be secured. Clamp the pipe to the wall covering the line with the top flush with the top of the wall. Using the existing holes in the pipe, drill through the pipe about one inch into the wall and post.

, Do this for the remaining 10' sections and add the connectors as shown in the photo. Pivot the short pipe on the top screw to an angle that allows the connectors to slide on top of it.

, Do the same on the other wall.

, With the assistance of an 8 or 10 stepladder, assemble the pipe lengths and connectors from each side of the end of the wall, placing the peak connector last.

, Place a 118” top rail pipe (3) into the second connector, up on the end. The longer the pipe, the more flexibility you have to move the ends of the pipe, so place a mid way connector on the end of the 118” pipe (4), and move it away from the end of the 56” pipe until you can slide it over and into position. Do the same on the other side (6,7). Last of all, insert the 118” pipe into the peak end connector (9) and place an intermediate peak connector on the other end (10). Flexing the long pipe, attach it to the two 56” pipes (6,8).


This photo shows the order of placement. Repeat for each additional segment until completed.

, Roll or fold the cover so that it is 30' long. Transport it to the shelter site, and lay it along the outside of one fence.

, Throw the ropes over the tubular framework to the other fence.

, Tie it off and move to the next rope doing the same. Continue to do this until you have pulled the cover all the way over the framework.

, Do the same at the other end. Secure each corner in both directions. Now go back and secure the remaining grommets to the 118” rail near the top of the fence. Alternate between each fence so the cover isn't stretched to one side more than the other. Using the ladder, finish the end grommets.

Anchor carriages to joists with lag screws.",How to Create Garage Ceiling Sliding Storage," Position one of your 2x4 boards so its narrow edge is flat against the lip of the long edge of a tote. Use a clamp to hold the board in place against the tote at its middle. Repeat this process on the other side. Measure the distance between the inner edges of the boards to find the carriage width.Depending on your space limitations, you may need to use smaller totes, especially if you plan on installing your sliding storage above your garage door.;
, Use a tape measure and a pencil to mark both of your 2x4 boards at 4 ft (1.2 m). Measure and mark off your plywood in eight strips. Four strips should be 3 in (7.6 cm) wide and 4 ft long. The remaining four strips should be 5 in (12.7 cm) wide and 4 ft long., A miter saw will be ideal for making the simple cuts where your 2x4 boards have been marked, but you can also use a circular saw. When cutting your plywood into strips along the marked lines, use a circular saw or table saw.When sawing your lumber, be sure to wear safety glasses. Small pieces of sawdust can get in your eyes and cause irritation or injury.
In a pinch, you can use a hand saw to cut your lumber. However, this will take a considerable amount of time and elbow grease.

, At this point, you should have four 2x4 boards 4 ft (1.2 m) long. Position one of the boards on its long, narrow side. Apply a wood glue to the upward facing part of the 2x4. Lay a 3-inch wide (7.6 cm) plywood strip flat on the 2x4 so their ends are evenly aligned and the 2x4 is centered under the plywood.To ensure that the 2x4 and plywood strip aren’t jostled and knocked out of alignment, hold them together with a clamp until the glue finishes drying. Dry time should be indicated on the glue’s label.
This plywood strip, and another you'll be adding to this same 2x4, will overhang the 2x4 on both sides, as the plywood strips are wider than the 2x4.

, Measure and mark the plywood along its center in 10 in (25.4 cm) intervals. Fasten the strip and board with 2-inch (5 cm) screws at these marks to connect and reinforce the board and strip., Reorient the 2x4 so the attached plywood strip is facing downward. In the same fashion as the previous strip, glue and screw a 5-inch (12.7 cm) plywood strip to the upward facing, long, narrow side of the 2x4.When finished, the 2x4 should have two plywood strips attached. The 3-inch wide strip will form the bottom flange of the sliding storage carriage, the 5-inch wide strip the top flange.

, Like the first 2x4, you’re going to attach two plywood strips to each of the boards along their long, narrow sides. Each board should be comprised of one 3-inch wide strip and one 5-inch wide strip., Use a stud finder to locate ceiling joists. These will provide the best support for your sliding storage. Using your level as a edge, draw lines along the joists to outline where you’ll be installing the carriages. Each line should be separated by the previously measured width between the carriages.Avoid installing sliding storage less than 2 ft (61 cm) away from lights and garage door springs. If you’re concerned your sliding storage might not fit above your retracted garage door, avoid installing it in the path the door travels.
Verify that joists fall along your drawn carriage lines by poking through the ceiling with a nail. If you hit hard wood, the joist is there and your carriage lines will be sufficiently supported., Hold a carriage up to the ceiling at the marked joist line. The 5-inch plywood strip of the carriage should be flat against the ceiling. Screw the carriage into the ceiling at this line at 12-inch (30.5 cm) intervals with 3-inch (7.6 cm) screws along the flange straight on. Repeat this process until your carriages are arrayed in pairs.These screws are not intended to be the primary support of the storage, but instead will hold the carriage in place while testing it and installing your main anchors (lag screws).

, Take an empty bin and try slide it into the space between carriages. If the tote does not fit, you’ll have to unfasten the screws and reposition the carriages. After checking the fit of the tote, remove the tote and set it off to the side.While testing your carriage, you'll have the perfect opportunity to check it with your level. If your carriages are not fastened level, totes may slide out over time.

, Drill a 3/16 in (.5 cm) guide hole through the top flange so the hole terminates at a joist. Use a ratchet or socket to fasten the flange to the joist with lag screws. Repeat this on the opposite side of the fastened lag screw. Use at least four lag screws fastened at no less than two joists per carriage piece.Storing items in your sliding ceiling storage that weigh more than 210 lb (95.3 kg) could cause the tote to fall. If the storage pulls free of the wall because of too much weight, it could also damage the ceiling."

Decide where you want your shelving. You may not want to put shelving in an area where you tend to temporarily store things that are on the floor as you may not be able to comfortably reach the shelves.
What kinds of things will you be storing on the shelves? You will want whatever it is to be convenient ie. you wouldn't want to store laundry items on an opposite wall from your clothes washer.
Measure the area you have chosen for your shelves keeping in mind the distance between shelves.;
, Referring to your plan purchase enough shelving for the area where you will install them. Buy brackets to secure the shelves to the wall.

, Chances are the stock length of the material will be different than what you need.

,, Referring to your plan, position the shelves according and mark a spot where the bracket will go.

Depending on the clutter and the junk pile up, it can be a quick afternoon of tidying or a long weekend project requiring a couple trips to the hardware store. Clean out the drawers, the shelves, and the storage units and start over.


Don't try to a half-job by moving some stuff around and calling it ""reorganized,"" even if your garage is relatively uncluttered. It's still a good idea to re-evaluate the storage space you do have to use it to its maximum potential.;
, When you're getting started, pair like items with like items. How you choose categories will depend on the stuff you've got in your garage, but you might pair automotive tools with automotive tools, yard tools with yard tools, and sporting goods with other sporting goods for an easy start. You can get more specific as you start organizing.


Set up a few tarps on the driveway or in the yard if you've got a real mess on your hands. This can help to keep the mess contained if you've got especially greasy or oily tools.

, If you've got a cluttered garage, it's important to get rid of anything that's broken, useless, or unnecessary. Doing so should reduce your amount of clutter significantly and make it easier to organize what you really do need more effectively. Here are some questions to help you figure out whether or not a particular item is essential to your garage:


Have you used the item in the last year?
Does the item work properly? If not, are you likely to fix it in the next year?
Is the item valuable, or does it have sentimental value?

, Whatever you end up putting in the ""unusable"" pile, get rid of it as soon as possible. Don't take it to the dump ""next time you get around to it,"" do it right now. Clearing out the clutter is the only way to commit to a more organized and efficient work space in your garage. If you don't need it, don't keep it around to take up premium space.


Throw away broken or damaged items that are beyond repair and give away duplicate items or outdated items that you've replaced with newer models. You might consider giving away an old busted socket set if you've got a newer set yourself. Recycle scrap metal and other valuable stuff you might find lying around the garage.

Consider a garage sale. If your garage is packed to the gills with old Halloween decorations, stacks of Rolling Stone from the mid-80s, and trash-bags full of kids clothes, it's probably time to throw some price stickers on the junk and have a yard sale.

, After evaluating all the usable items, clean them up as well as possible. Don't put away dirty tools, muddy soccer cleats, and otherwise compromised gear into new, neatly organized places. Spend time committing to clean.


If it's been a couple years since you've cleaned up around the space, reorganization is a good opportunity to do just that. Clean the floors with disinfectant and address the dust that's built up over the years.
Using a bit of acetone is a great way of quickly cleaning up old stainless steel tools that have been laying around collecting grease. Use an old rag and a small amount of acetone in a well-ventilated area.

, One of the easiest ways to maximize the space in your garage is to get items like storage hooks and wire baskets, which can be mounted onto the walls wherever it's convenient for your access. You will also need some brackets to secure these storage items into place. The best part is that they can easily be customized to fit the specific layout of your garage, they won't collect dust and they can be moved if necessary. These types of storage hangers are great for common-use items, as well as bulky or unusual items like:


Snow skis
Bicycles
Tennis rackets
Leaf blowers
Rakes
Hoses
Rope

, For sporting goods, seasonal decorations, and other loose stuff that needs to be grouped together, buying some plastic tubs can be a great way of organizing. Go with clear plastic to make sure you can see everything that's inside without having to dig around.

, If space is at a premium, consider installing some shelves, or buying some pre-fab shelving units so you can increase the storage space in your garage.


It's also common to hang peg board for quick and easy storage purposes. Rather than drilling stuff directly into the wall, you can hang hooks or other storage brackets off some pieces of particle board to keep the walls clean.

, If you're a big tool collector, consider investing in a tool chest, or some more substantial tool boxes to help keep your collection organized and arranged properly. Rolling tool chests are excellent ways to keep your automotive, yard, and home repair tools clean and available when you need them.

, Categorize your items in terms of use and separate them appropriately. For instance, you could place recreational gear like skateboards, roller blades and golf clubs in one area. You could then put your tools, power saws and blades in another. Once you have everything sorted out, you can decide the best way to arrange them for easy access.


How you choose to organize will depend on what you have, but it's common to separate the tools and the sporting goods or other storage stuff. Some people's garages are sacred car spaces, while for others it's more of an attic run-off zone. Keep organized according to what you have.

, Put the stuff you don't use often toward the back, or the more difficult to reach spaces of the garage. If you hardly ever go golfing, you would want to place your clubs behind other things that you use more often, like the lawn mower or your socket wrenches.

, You may also want to make seasonal adjustments in your garage, so you can rotate summer and winter items accordingly. You probably won't need your snow blower during the heat of summer, so you can schedule yearly reorganizations to keep your space in the most optimum arrangement for the season. It doesn't need to take more than a few minutes.

, Finally, you can prevent a lot of frustration by properly labeling storage bins or anything that you have to open to access items. If you have small items like different sized screws and nails, you should put these into small containers and mark them accordingly. It may be a little more tedious at first, but should make your life easier later on.

Look out for discoloration.,
Examine all the items in your shed to determine what the water is dripping on to.,
Wait until it rains and then examine your shed.,
Distinguish condensation from a leak.,
Avoid guttering problems.,
Cut away vegetation growing on the sides of the shed.",How to Check the Garden Shed for Leaks1," To check for leaks you’ll need to look out for discoloration on the inside roof and walls of the shed. You’ll need to check for any discoloration to the structure, particularly stains and darker patches. Check the sides of the shed for dark patches or streaks as this may indicate dripping or running water.


You should also look for discoloration on fabric, as it could mean there is mold growing. There may also be signs of mold, especially on any fabric stored in the shed. Check fabric for any dark spots of mildew. However, keep in mind that mold can also be caused by condensation.;
, You should also look for discoloration, like patches of rust, on your tools and any other metal items.


The items affected may not be directly under the source of the leak as water may be running down the walls and collecting elsewhere.

, If you are having trouble spotting discoloration, you could examine your shed after it rains. If there are puddles anywhere in the shed, it means you have a leak. The puddles will most likely form under or near where the crack in the shed is.

, Condensation occurs when the moisture in the air forms water droplets on a cold surface. Don’t confuse condensation with a leak. A properly-ventilated shed is unlikely to have major problems with condensation but you can expect colder parts of the shed to attract condensation.


Avoid problems caused by condensation by keeping your shed well-ventilated and ensuring the contents aren’t too close together as this prevents slows down air circulation. Try not to stack things against the external walls, as these may transfer condensation to whatever touches them.

, Guttering is a means of moving water away from the shed by directing it to drains in the ground. Check that any guttering you have on your shed is clear and moving water as it should do. If it is leaking it can cause water damage.


Gutters can get clogged up with dirt, moss, leaves and dropped fruit from trees. Clear this if it is causing a problem.

, You should also take the opportunity to clear vegetation or any dirt growing against the external walls of the shed. As the shed is unlikely to have waterproofing in its walls, it needs to be able to circulate air to remove dampness.

Have the wiring and cables fixed.",How to Convert the Garage Into a Private Study," Remove everything and make a decision on whether or not you need to keep it. For the items that you keep, you will need to make a decision about where these will go. Do you have a garden shed, or perhaps the items can go in the basement? Alternately, the garage items can remain in the garage but purchase or build better storage facilities that hide the items away from site.;
, This carpet is especially adapted to take the weight of cars and spillages too. It's hardy but also decent to look at and comfortable to walk on. It is also ideal for study furniture, as it is firm enough to roll on a wheelchair at a desk.

, At the minimum, add a desk, some shelves for books, a chair for studying from, and good lighting. Other additions might include bookcases, filing cabinet, printer stand, etc. When designing the layout, decide whether you must leave space for the car(s) still or whether you have a much larger space to work with. If you are still letting the cars live in the garage, try to create a barrier between your study space and the cars, such as a movable wall partition, a concertina sliding and folding accordion room divider, or opaque glass wall sliding screens. That way, you will maintain your privacy and sense of homeliness at nighttime when the cars will usually be inside the garage.

, This will immediately brighten up the study space and make it feel a lot more pleasant. It will also open up the look of your entire home if the garage forms a part of the house. Get some advice from an architect or interior designer on the options available.

, Internet access is essential for the student. Consider whether you also need a telephone. Have the wiring brought to where you plan to place the desk.

Remove loose moss with scarification.Scarification, also referred to as dethatching, is the process of vigorously raking or agitating the lawn in order to remove loose moss and other compact organic material.,
Try a glyphosate herbicide.,
Use iron sulfate or another sulfate-based herbicide.,
Consider using a moss-killing soap.,
Plant shade-loving perennials and shrubs.,
Let the sun shine through.,
Avoid watering your lawn excessively.,
Give your lawn enough water to thrive.,
Prevent injuries to your lawn.,
Aerate the area.,
Dethatch your lawn regularly.,
Seed thin areas.,
Treat the lawn with fertilizer.,
Spread agricultural lime.",How to Get Rid of Moss in Your Lawn,"


If you have a small lawn, you can do this by hand. Simply rake the yard thoroughly and with ample force to lift the moss away. Use a spring-tine rake.
If you have a larger lawn, you can get a dethatching blade for your lawn mower. Set the height adjustment so that the tines can touch the surface of the soil, but if you set it too low, you will also remove your grass. Dethatch your entire lawn using this method and dispose of the moss you remove.
It is especially important to dethatch your lawn if you apply a chemical herbicide to kill or weaken moss beforehand.;
, Glyphosate-based herbicides are among the most popular currently on the market, but they tend to have mixed results when used to kill moss.This chemical works by being absorbed through leaves and transferred into the soil.
The exact conditions needed to make glyphosate effective against moss are presently unknown, but for best results, apply the herbicide only if there are no competing plants that the herbicide might go after instead.
As with any herbicide, follow the label instructions carefully.

, While these herbicides are less common, they tend to have a higher rate of success when used to kill moss. Iron or ferrous sulfate is recommended most often, but ammonium sulfate and copper sulfate herbicides are also effective.


Iron weakens the moss, often killing it in the process or making it easier to kill and remove manually.
Spray a 5 gallon (20 L) mixture over a 1000 square feet (304.8 square meters) area. The mixture should be about 3 oz (90 ml) of iron sulfate to 5 gallons (20 L) of water.
If using copper sulfate, use 2 to 5 oz (60 to 150 ml) for every 4 gallons (16 L) of water, and spray this mixture over a 1000 square foot (304.8 square meter) area.
Always follow label instructions carefully.

, A cryptocidal soap product kills moss on contact. The chemical bleaches moss, turning it a white-yellow color, and should be applied sparsely.


These soaps do not pose any threat to sidewalks or other structures.
For best results, apply this treatment during a dry spell, when moss is at its weakest.
Carefully follow the instructions on the label when applying.

, Grass does not grow well in areas of heavy shade, but regrettably, moss does. If you cannot control the amount of shade your lawn receives, try planting flowers and other plants that thrive in shaded areas to prevent moss from growing instead.


Plants that love shade include astilbe, brunnera, heuchera, hostas, hellebore, ferns, hydrangea, pulmonaria, and tiarella.There are other shrubs and flowers that do well with shade, as well. Simply look for shade-loving plants the next time you visit a gardening store or plant nursery.

, Moss grows well in the shade, but most normal varieties of grass do not. If you want to make your lawn healthier, consider clearing away removable obstacles from your yard so that more natural sunlight can reach your grass.


Keep piles of firewood, bricks, or other debris inside storage areas like your garage or garden shed.
When building a new shed, think about how the position of the structure may cast shade over the lawn.
Trim large trees and heavy shrubs so that more light can peek through.

, Moss thrives in areas of heavy moisture. If your lawn is doing poorly for other reasons and is already vulnerable to moss, excessive watering will only hasten the arrival of moss.


You should especially avoid watering your lawn at night in the early fall or spring, during which moss growth is most persistent.
If your lawn is naturally soggy, try improving its ability to drain by changing the grading of the lawn, aerating the lawn, dethatching the lawn, or installing subsurface drain lines., While too much moisture will create the ideal conditions for moss, too little moisture can weaken your grass and make your lawn more vulnerable to moss, too.


When lawns are too dehydrated, the grass turns brown and weak. It may become too weak to respond to rain or other moisture when it does arrive. As a result, once it rains, the moss grows quickly while the grass continues to die.

, While most people want to be able to enjoy their lawn, if you treat it too roughly, the grass will become notably weak. As the grass begins dying on its own, you might see more moss creeping in.


Lawn injuries can occur when you play sports in the yard, ride a bike in your yard, or have a dog dig through your lawn.
Additionally, crane fly larvae can also cause physical injury to your lawn. If you have a lot of crane flies in your area, consider taking measures to exterminate or repel them.

, Over time, your lawn can become too compacted for air, water, and fertilizer to reach the roots of the grass. As a result, the grass can die off and moss can grow in its place. Regular aeration can help control and prevent this.


Rent, borrow, or buy a core aerator machine to get the job done. This machine pushes a set of hollow tines into the lawn, digging out small batches of soil less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.
By removing cores of soil, you free up just enough space in your yard for the soil to spread out and decompress.
Try to do this at least once before the start of the growing season and once before the end of the growing season.

, Dethatching disturbs the lawn more deeply than aeration does. If aeration is done on a regular basis, you will not need to dethatch quite as often. If you have a lot of problems with moss, however, it is still a good idea to go the extra length and dethatch, as well.


For best results, dethatch during the spring every other year.
A dethatching lawn mower blade digs down into the lawn and yanks up most of the plant material growing in the upper thatch layer of your lawn rather than in the soil. Since this is where moss grows, disturbing the thatch can help prevent moss from settling in.

, If certain areas of your lawn are sparsely covered by grass, planting grass seed in those areas is a good way to prevent moss from covering those areas and improve the overall quality of your lawn.


Consider seeding your lawn with a shade-resistant variety of grass. These include ryegrass, fine fescues, roughstalk bluegrass, and bentgrass. Alternatively, you could also look for a pre-packaged mix labeled as ""sun-shade"" grass seed.
When adding new seed, topdress the seeds with 1/4 inch (0.625 cm) of loose soil or sand and keep the area moist until the seedlings establish themselves.

, Moss can also squeeze its way in if the soil has poor fertility. Poor fertility means that the soil is unable to provide the nutrients needed for grass to thrive. Regular fertilizer is the best way to improve these conditions.


You can have a lawn care professional test a sample of your soil from the area where moss grows. In general, though, a good indication that low fertility is your lawn's problem will be if the moss appears in dry, sunny areas of the lawn.
Use a fertilizer with a high concentration of nitrogen and decent amounts of potassium and iron.
Fertilizer is most helpful when use four times per year: early spring, late spring, mid-summer, and early fall.

, Lime should be used to control the acidity of your soil. Moss often grows once acidic soil begins limiting the nutrients supplied to your grass, providing room for moss to sneak in.


Use a calcium-based lime for best results.
Test the pH of you soil. Ideal conditions will be neutral, ranging from 6.5 to 7. If the pH is below 6, it is acidic, and if it is above 7, it is alkaline.
Only use lime to treat acidic soil, not alkaline soil.
Apply the lime to your lawn twice each growing season if your soil has tested acidic.

Look for damage that could lead to a crack.,
Check to see if water could be getting in from below the shed.,
Consider raising your shed if you suspect water is coming in from below.,
Use breeze blocks if you don’t want to lay a concrete base.,
Make sure that all of the wood you use is pressure treated.",How to Check the Garden Shed for Leaks2," Examine the shed both inside and out for visible signs of damage. Examples may include torn waterproof felt on the roof, and damaged shingles or tiles.


There may also be cracks in the structure of the shed caused by damaged or warped wood.

, Water can also penetrate the shed from the ground. To combat this, you should put your shed on top of a concrete base, or suspend it with breeze blocks and pressure treated timber. If the shed was not raised off the ground when it was constructed, you are more vulnerable to water coming in from below.

, Ideally you should cast a concrete base slightly larger than your shed base. To do this:


Use wooden planks to define the area and contain the concrete. Lay about 6 inches (15.2 cm) of hardcore and then 6 inches (15.2 cm) of concrete on top of that.
You can anchor your shed to the concrete base using bolts. It’s important that the water drains away from the shed and doesn’t pool against the edges.

, If you don’t want to lay a concrete base, you can sink some paving slabs or breeze blocks so the top edge is slightly above ground level by about an inch. Lay wooden planks above these as a base for your shed. This keeps the shed above the damp ground and lets air circulate underneath., It’s important that any timber in contact with the ground is pressure-treated and painted with or soaked in wood preservative to make it resistant to damp.

Repair the roof.,
Patch up any holes you find.,
Patch cracks in the shed.,
Repaint your shed every few years.",How to Check the Garden Shed for Leaks3," Repair any damage you can see to the external roof by replacing lost tiles or shingles. Avoid making any further holes in felt roof material by nailing down loose bits.

, You can purchase a bitumen mat material that works well as a ‘sticking plaster’ for any roof holes. This is available with a self-adhesive backing so it can simply be cut to fit and applied to the roof.


You can also apply a generous layer of bitumen paint before adding the patch of felt. Apply the felt while the paint is still wet.
Duct tape also works well as a robust temporary measure.

, If you spot any cracks in the shed, patch them immediately using wood filler (outside) and duct tape (inside). Any leaking windows can be patched using sealant., To preserve the life of your shed, it’s a good idea to repaint it every few years with timber preservative, stain or paint. This will help preserve the wood.

Clean the garage door in the same way by using a clean cloth and a bucket of warm water.,
If you’ve worked your way around the walls of the building, the last area you will need to address is the roof.,
After completing these stages, make your way around the garage and see if all areas have been treated.",How to Clean the Exterior of Your Garage," This will get rid of the build-up of dirt and make the brickwork look fresher. However, don’t use the jet wash machine on the garage door or the windows as this may cause damage to these more fragile surfaces. Remember that these machines can be extremely powerful, so you might take some of the cement away when cleaning the brickwork.;
, Make sure you tackle the built up of dirt in the corners and along the window fixings too, so that the both the windows and the surroundings look clean.

, Again, you don’t want to use the pressurised jet wash on this part of the structure as it may cause paintwork to peel away, or leave small dents on the surface.

, This is where moss, twigs and leaves can gather, so you may need to use a ladder to get on to the roof and sweep away any debris. Make sure you have assistance during this stage and take care as you obviously won’t want to fall off the roof.

, If you notice any sections that you have missed then simply clean them and then stand back and admire your newly cleaned garage.

Get several shallow cans of equal size.,
Arrange the cans (open end up) in the lawn around your sprinkler(s).,
Turn on your sprinkler(s) for 15 minutes.,
Measure the water collected in the cans.,
Find the average number of inches collected.,
Figure out how much water your lawn needs.,
Determine how long to leave your sprinkler(s) on.,
Ensure adequate, even coverage.",How to Calibrate Your Sprinklers," Tuna cans work great for this, but just about any flat-bottomed container with a wide opening will work. The opening of the container should be as large as the bottom (bottles, for example, are not a good choice, because the opening is usually much smaller than the rest of the bottle). All the cans must be of the same size. You don't need more than 3 or 4 cans for each sprinkler head, though the more you have the more accurate your measurements will be.;
, If you just have one sprinkler, set up the cans in various places within the sprinkler's range. If you have an irrigation system (sprinkler system) with multiple sprinkler heads, set up several cans within the range of each sprinkler head, avoiding any areas with overlap (places that get water from two or more sprinkler heads). Try to distribute the cans in such a way as to sample every area the sprinkler waters.

, If you have a sprinkler system, just turn it on. If you use a hose with a spigot, you want to use the same water pressure that would when you normally water. If you usually just turn the water on full blast, do that. If not, mark a spot on the handle with a marker or a piece of tape or string, and note what position the mark is in when you turn the handle to achieve the desired flow.

, Once you turn the water off, collect the cans and pour all the water into one container. The container must be exactly the same width as the containers you used to collect the water. Use a ruler to measure how many inches of water are in the can. If you're testing more than one sprinkler, measure each set of cans (the cans around each individual sprinkler) separately from the sets of cans around the other sprinkler heads.

, Divide the total inches measured in the previous step by the number of cans used to collect the water. For example, if you arranged four cans around a sprinkler and collected a total of 2"", the average per can is 0.5"" (2"" / 4 cans). This is the average amount of water distributed onto your lawn in 15 minutes.

, Deep watering is essential to promote healthy, drought-resistant grass. The amount of water your lawn requires depends on the type of grass you have and the type of soil.


In general, you should water bluegrass so that the water penetrates 6-8"" in the soil; for most other types of grass, you should aim for 8-12"".
1"" of water applied to the surface will generally permeate sandy soil to 12"", loamy soil to 6-8"", and clay soil to 4-5"".

, Use the measurement you obtained to calculate how long you'll need to water according to the guidelines for your grass and soil type. For instance, if your measurements indicate that your sprinkler distributes 0.5"" of water in 15 minutes, you will need to leave your sprinkler on for 30 minutes if you have bluegrass and loamy soil, since 30 minutes of watering will give your lawn 1"" (2 X 0.5"") of water, and 1"" of water will penetrate loamy soil to a depth of 6-8"", which is exactly the amount required for bluegrass.

, If you're checking a sprinkler system and find that one or more sprinkler heads distribute significantly more or less water than the others, you should determine the problem to avoid watering some parts of your lawn more than others. This can happen for a couple reasons.


If you have different types of sprinkler heads, you should either change the heads to ensure they're all the same, or zone your sprinkler system so that heads with a greater flow are in a separate zone from those with lesser flows. This way you can turn zones with different flows on and off separately to ensure that each zone is watered only as long as it needs to be.
If your sprinkler heads are all the same and you don't have different zones, you may have a problem with your sprinkler system. A broken sprinkler head may be distributing too much or too little water, or an obstruction or leak somewhere in the line could reduce the flow to one or more heads.

Know what kind of grass you have.,
Know what type of soil you have.,
Know your lawn habits.,
Decide which type of yard aerator to use.,
Prep the yard for aeration.,
Check the moisture level of your yard.,
Know which areas of your yard are the most trafficked.,
Position the yard aerator in one corner of the yard.,
Fertilize your yard after you aerate it.",How to Aerate a Yard," Different types of grasses grow most actively during certain seasons of the year.It's best to aerate your lawn just before or during your lawn's most active period of growth, so that the grass will grow back quickly and recover from the aeration process.


Warm-season grasses like buffalo grass, bermuda grass and St. Augustine grass grow most actively during the summer. If you have warm season grass, it's best to aerate in the late spring to early summer.
Cool-season grasses like Kentucky bluegrass, fescue and ryegrass have their most active growing season in the fall, when the temperature drops. Aerate cool season grass at the end of the summer or the beginning of fall. Just make sure you aerate early enough that you allow the lawn to recover from aeration for a month or so before the first frost hits.;
, Clay-heavy soils need to be aerated frequently, about once a year, since the soil tends to be dense and compact. Sandy soils can be aerated every two years or so.

, Do you drive on your lawn often, or frequently have large groups of people walking over it? Lawns that are trampled often need to be aerated once a year to prevent the soil from getting too compact.


Have you recently reseeded your lawn? It's best not to aerate within a year of reseeding, since the grass needs time to get strong.
Test your lawn's need for aeration by examining how deep the grass's roots extend into the soil. If the roots don't go deeper than two inches, you should aerate the soil. You can check using a soil probe, single core probe, a heavy, long shanked screwdriver, or a small spade.

, There are two types of aerators: power and manual. Choose the one that best fits your needs.


A power yard aerator is a gasoline-driven machine that is best suited for large yards. This type of aerator uses a spike system to poke holes in the soil or a coring system that pulls plugs of soil out of the ground to allow for water and nutrient absorption. You can rent a power yard aerator from a landscape company by the day for a small fee. Talk with your neighbors about splitting the cost of the rental and sharing the machine.
A manual yard aerator works more efficiently on small yards or heavily-trafficked areas of a lawn. Two types of manual yard aerators exist: a coring-style aerator that uses a cylinder to remove cores of earth and a spike-type of aerator that rolls over patches of lawn to insert holes without extracting soil. Lawn-care specialists and enthusiasts promote the core-style of yard aerators, as these types promote the best water and nutrient absorption.

, Yard aerators work best on cleared, mowed yards. If you have sprinklers, then turn them on for a short time first and mark where each on is so that you can avoid them.


Rake debris like leaves, sticks and other plant matter from the yard to make sure nothing obstructs the path of the aerator.

Mow the yard before you aerate to ensure the aerator has easy access to the ground. If your lawn mower doesn't contain a bag to catch the grass clippings, rake them up and discard or compost them when you are finished mowing.

, If your region has been dry lately, Water your lawn for a few days before you aerate the yard to soften tough soil. Manual and power yard aerators perform more efficiently on softened earth. However, core aerators perform better on dry soil because the corer will not pull the plug out if it is too wet and aeration holes will seal shut.

, Plan to go over those areas with your aerator more than once to ensure you sufficiently aerate that section of yard.

, Move it from one side of the yard to the other in even rows until the whole area is properly aerated.


Don't cover the entire yard more than once. Only double over areas that need extra aeration.
If your yard requires further aeration, run the yard aerator in the opposite direction from the first pass you took to maximize aeration.
Leave the cores of earth alone after you aerate. These cores will compost over time and benefit your yard with nutrients. Keep in mind that it might look unsightly for a little while. If someone asks about it, then you can just make a joke and say you have very healthy earthworms.

, Spread compost, sand, peat moss, or another fertilizer over your yard to help your lawn spring back from aeration. The fertilizer will be absorbed easily through the newly-made holes.

Go around to the side of the desk that is braced on the floor cleat.,
Remove the cleat from the floor.

",How to Move an Oak Desk By Yourself2," Place it on the floor, butted up to the side of the desk. Pre-drill two holes and place a couple of deck screws through the scrap piece, into the floor. This provides a 'hard stop' for the desk on one side.;
, Lift the desk end, by pushing on the side of the desk opposite where the floor cleat is, holding the desk from sliding.

, Carefully glide the square dolly under the lifted end of the desk. The dolly has carpet fabric attached to it, so it provides a 'grip' on the heavy desk.

, Place the other dolly right next to the desk. Using a wide stance, lift the side of the desk up. It lifts much easier than the first side because the other end is already up on the dolly. You can now walk the desk over the other dolly, if the dolly at the other end has rotating caster wheels.

Determine if you have the legal right to dismantle the fence.,
Decide if you want to keep the fence posts; if they are in good condition and you plan to replace your old fencing, you can remove the old fencing but still salvage the posts:


Use a chain saw to cut through each section of the fence; make a vertical cut alongside each fence post the section is attached to.,
Remove fence post concrete footings.,
Remove fence posts that aren’t set in concrete by wiggling them back and forth until they are loose enough to pull out of the ground.

,
Dispose of the old fencing.",How to Take Down an Old Wooden Fence," Check with the zoning department in your town to make sure the fence doesn’t straddle property lines. If you remove a fence that straddles your property line, your neighbor can sue you for property damage. It’s also a good idea to get your neighbor’s permission in writing.;
, Most fences have either 4’ (1,219.2 mm) or 8’ (2,438.4 mm) sections between each set of fence posts.
Put each section of fence you remove in a stack for later disposal.
Saw the fence posts off at the base if you don’t plan to reuse them.

, It isn’t strictly necessary if you don’t plan to erect another fence, but most homeowners want the footings removed. Here are several ways you can remove the footings:


Dig next to the footing until you get to the bottom of the post. Work a crowbar underneath the bottom and pop the footing out. This method is much easier if you have someone help you.
Bust up the concrete footing with a sledgehammer; this is relatively easy because the inside of the footing consists of a 4x4 piece of (usually rotted) wood.

,, Check with your local landfill to see if there are any disposal restrictions. Some jurisdictions may allow curbside pickup with your regular trash, but regulations may require you to bundle the wood into manageable pieces and tie them up with twine.

At the least you want to have your concerns registered, but hopefully they can be addressed and you'll feel more peace of mind.
Make sure if you're paying for the location you'll have enough money to plan for unusual circumstances. Determine if you're liable for damage and/or if you'll be in charge of your own maintenance. Have extra cash saved for these things as well as for a few months of payments on the lease/rent/mortgage should something cut off your paycheck or source of funding.;
, Every country is different in their visa regulations. What's more, it also depends on where you're coming from. You may be able to go to the country for a visit, but do you need a visa to stay? Or maybe you need a visa to even get past the airport? Make sure you have all this in line before you take the leap.


Does your school or work get your work or student permit in order for you? What are the deadlines and the time constrictions? Do you need to alert your banks, too? How about licensure, taxes, or other paperwork?

,  This will help you to get used to the new environment and learn the language faster.  The sooner this happens, the better you will adjust. It's wise to move to the country with a job in hand; if that's not possible, it should be your first priority.


However, you do not necessarily have to get hired; you can also go to school.  Whether you go to school or work, you keep yourself in touch with local residents, practicing their language and learning about their culture. In addition to padding your pocketbook, of course.

, Most people end up developing a minimalist lifestyle where they only own clothing, a laptop and a few personal items while living abroad. Your remaining stuff should fit in one large case plus hand luggage. The fact of the matter is that you don't need your things at home and you won't likely need them when you get back – you'll know how to get by without them. So why not get some cash for them?


eBay and Craigslist are great methods for getting rid of your stuff and getting a pretty penny in return. But word of mouth, local ads, and social media are great, too.

, This cannot be said enough. Every country has a wikipedia article, countless entries in countless encyclopedias, and that's great, but it's not enough. Find out about the culture! Do people there follow traffic signals or are they more like suggestions? Do they tip after meals in restaurants? What is the predominant religion and what impact does it have on those who might not practice it (such as you, the traveler)?


Try to visit for a week or so before you move if at all possible. This can give you a good head on your shoulders and help you know what you're getting into.
As far as money is concerned, you should find out the average cost of living in this country.  Plan your budget ahead, so that you can pay not only for room and board, but also for your secondary needs.
More importantly, you should know about this country’s laws, which will help you avoid various problems with the police and make it easier for you to stay safe.  

, If it's hot throughout the year, leave your winter clothes behind (or vice versa). What's more, find out about the culture to see what's acceptable and what's not – for example, in some Muslim countries you have to cover your knees and shoulders in public and leave behind any clothes or items that aren't accepted or you won't be able to take into the country.


Check the prices in the country you're moving to. If furniture and clothes there are really expensive, it may be better to bring a few more things with you, depending on the distance you're traveling.

, If, of course, that language is different than your own.  Otherwise, you could feel lost in that country. It would be great if you already spoke some of the language by the time you moved so that you could communicate with the locals.


Although it is possible in many countries to survive speaking only English, if you are truly eager to become a part of your new country, you should master its language.  

,  After the move, those goals should serve as milestones on your path to assimilation, reminding you of the reason why you moved. Did you move to make more money? See the world? Meet different people? Advance your career?


Often moving abroad is what you make of it – you could love it or you could hate it, depending on what mindset you go in with. If you embrace adventure and the wildly different culture, it could be the best experience of your life. 

, One of the toughest moments of the moving process is leaving everything behind and starting over.  If you do not want to suffer in your new environment, it is important to be realistic with yourself about what you're leaving behind. Only after that will you be able to make the next step and move on.  Otherwise, you might miss home so badly that you will be tempted to give everything up and move back.


Consider the phrase, ""Once you leave, you can never come back."" And in a figurative sense, it's true. If you come back, the place will not be the same. What's more, if you come back, you will not be the same. It's important to realize this before you leave and if it's a sacrifice you want to make.

, On a regional level, have a map of the cities around your destination and maybe figure out what kinds of transportation (public trans/car/bike/foot) will get you around, as well as related costs and potential time investment. Also do this for the city you'll be in as well.


Find the path to the most common probable destination of your day and week; if you're going to study abroad, find the path or paths to your university from your home. If you're going to work, find several paths there and back. For all of these, attempt, if possible, to ascertain the safety of the route. After that, explore what landmarks might be along or near all of these routes. Not just amazing things like the Eiffel Tower or a sports stadium, but also grocery stores, food vendors, clothing boutiques, restaurants, supply/hardware stores, banks, postal boxes and fueling stations.

, Clerks in these places ought to have a cursory knowledge of their surroundings to provide you with their local expertise or at least direct you to someone who can help. All of this of course hinges on knowing where you will be living.


Know where you can go to be entertained!Try the favored activities of your new host country, but even something as simple as a movie theater or a bar can be a nice familiar base of entertainment when all else fails. Be ready to expand past your comfort zone and try everything once.

, This should be enough to pay for a few days of meals and a day or two of traveling if in a remote area or if in a decent city – it should be at least enough money to make it to the airport.


Always have some of your home currency, too, and know where you could exchange it (again, most banks are helpful for this).

, It typically takes around three months or so to feel fully settled in a new environment, so don't worry if you're still feeling homesick or anxious after a couple of months. You will only have a good idea of what long term life will be in that place after you have been there for a while. Don't put pressure on yourself to feel comfortable just yet.


Make sure you have someone you trust in your new destination and make sure you always have enough cash to leave the country. It's never good to feel trapped or stranded. These two things will set the stage for you slowly becoming comfortable.

, This will give you a chance to practice and get you integrated more quickly into the country.  If you think you do not speak the language well enough, you can take some language courses where you can meet other immigrants from around the world. Don't get intimidated – languages are hard, and most cultures are used to outsiders being less than fantastic at their mother tongue.


If you think you are fluent enough, you could also find a significant other, which would be a great way to learn the language and its idiosyncrasies because s/he will help you.

, Join a club, say yes to all invites, and reciprocate with the friends you'd like to keep. Be natural, open and kind. Try to adapt to the local social rules, engage in local social activities, and don't miss any chance you're given to go to a union with family or friends.


Sociability is probably very different than where you come from, but you don't have to worry about keeping your status anymore – right now you don't have any, so enjoy the anonymity.
Intuitively many people tend to search and join with people from their own country when they travel to give them a feeling of familiarity and safety. This helps a lot initially, but always be aware and try not to fall into the trap of ending up living in a microcosm that would be a replica of where you come from. Try to engage in social relationships with locals and not just those of your own kind.

, This may mean getting a driver’s license and a car as soon as possible.  Of course, if you intend to live in a big city, you can use public transportation.  However, you may need your own vehicle to become fully independent.


Even if you have never driven before, it is never too late to become a driver.  Having a car will make you feel completely different and make it feel like the world has opened up in front of you.

, If you are not satisfied with the quality of your life in your home country, moving abroad can give you a new start.  Once you have moved, you will not have your friends, your job, or familiar surroundings.  It will be a good starting point to build a new life, avoiding the mistakes you made in the past.  


For example, if you have been dreaming of quitting smoking, relocating overseas might be a good chance to do it.  To sum it up, immigrating is the best time to start improving yourself and being the person you've always wanted to be.

,  The first few months you might be tempted to give up everything and go back.  To not let that happen, you need to have faith in your own ability to succeed.  You should keep in mind the reason that brought you here.  You will have to be reminding yourself that every problem is temporary.  The more challenged you feel, the stronger you will eventually get.


When you first get there, everything is bright and glaringly new and different. As the days pass, you'll know what to expect and eventually it will just become an everyday thing. The things you found alarming (in a good or a bad way) will eventually just be commonplace. Give it time.

, To lighten the load, remove the mattress. This can usually be done by fully extending the sofa bed to its bed position. On the underside you will notice fabric ties connected to the mattress and then knotted around the frame. Untie each of the ties and move the mattress to an area out of the way. Once this is complete, fold the frame back into the sofa. Do not replace any of the pillows or cushions.

, You will want to tie off the metal frame in order to prevent it from unfolding while you are moving the sofa bed. To do this you will need a rope approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) in length. In the front of the sofa, where one would sit and around the center tie the mattress to the front of the sofa bed. If this is not available you can tie the mattress to the back or the arms of the sofa.

, Now you will want to lay the cardboard on the ground and lay the back of the sofa bed on to the cardboard. At this point you may decide to use the rope to secure the sofa bed to the piece of cardboard. If you have furniture dollies you can set the sofa on them after you have secured the sofa on the cardboard.

, If possible remove the feet of the sofa to ease its passage through doors. If this is not possible, skip to next step.

, Slide the sofa on its back on the cardboard (and furniture dollies) to the first door. If the feet are removed it should narrowly pass right through. If not, you may have to angle it such that each set of feet pass through.

, Remove the furniture dollies, if you have them. Slide the sofa forward while holding down pressure on the side furthest from the stairs. The sofa will begin to tilt downwards as it is moved forward. Slowly allow the sofa to lay on the stairs. Move the sofa until it is completely on the stairs. The person furthest down the stairs will need to make sure the cardboard does not catch on the stairs and direct the person highest on the stairs of when to push. The cardboard reduces the friction between the sofa and the stairs, thus making the stairs an easy obstacle to deal with. If the stairs corner or change direction, as in a flight of stairs, you will need to stand the sofa up on one of its ends (the arms). Then walk it, that is to say move it as though it were walking by sliding one side then the other, to the next flight of stairs such that the cardboard is facing the side of the stairs. Slowing lay the sofa down on the stairs. One person will need to guide the sofa down while ensuring that it does not slip while the other person will need to use their hands over their head to ease the sofa back down on the stairway slope. Repeat this step until the sofa is completely down the stairs.

, Slide the sofa, or replace the furniture dollies and roll, to its desired location.

Clear a path to the door.,
Determine the method of transportation.,
Secure a hand truck.,
Protect yourself from injuries.,
Prepare the appliances to be transported.,
Plan a safe route.",How to Move Appliances," The task of moving large appliances can be complicated by a route cluttered with anything that could slow you down. This is especially problematic when moving to a new residence. Other appliances, furniture, or boxes that are in the way can impede your safety, and disrupt your schedule. Establish a route wide enough to safely transport the appliance outside.;
, Plan for the type of vehicle you will need to move appliances. Failure to measure the interior cargo space of your vehicle can interfere with the move. Call for rates on rental trucks or trailers. Because larger vehicles usually cost more, it's important to determine the size you need beforehand.

, A hand truck, or dolly, is essential in preventing injury to your back or other joints and muscles when moving large appliances. If you are renting a moving truck, many companies supply hand trucks. Make sure the tires of the dolly are properly inflated. Use caution to prevent scraping or scratching the appliance, walls, or doors.

, Safety precautions are an essential part of moving bulky and heavy objects. Plan ahead to employ proper protective equipment, including slip resistant steel-toed boots and leather gloves. Lift by bending your knees, especially when lifting off of a porch or on to a truck or trailer. You shouldn't attempt to move appliances alone.

, Unplug the electrical cords from the wall sockets. After turning off the water inlets, unfasten and drain the water hoses from washing machines and ice-makers on refrigerators. To prevent danger from asphyxiation or fire, take extra precautions to ensure natural gas lines are closed before disconnecting from any gas operated appliances.


Prevent the appliances from sliding or tipping over with ratchet straps or tie-downs. Use blankets when transporting appliances to keep them free from surface scratches.

, Depending on the size of the vehicle, consider planning a route with the least amount of traffic flow. Major thoroughfares could be more congested, but if time is crucial a slower route might also mean more stop signs and narrower streets. Also think about neighborhoods with small children and pets, which could be a safety issue in a large truck.

, Make sure you have everyone's numbers, e-mail addresses and home addresses. Try not to create false promises of visits because it will let you and them down if you cannot afford it, as the first year living abroad is usually an expensive one.

, Know that they are going through exactly the same emotions. Decide before you arrive to your new home that you will embrace this new experience., Remember no one is going to force you to change, and be sure to take alone time because it will help you process your emotions and experiences.

, This is always a nerve racking phase but first impressions aren't everything. Most classmates or coworkers will be kind and even curious about you. They will help you get oriented. For those classmates or coworkers that are unkind - learn how to read their tones, faces and those around them. ""This is a very important skill,"" as tones and body language often say just as much as words.

, Your new country may financially support it, but if not, it's well worth the investment. You will meet other expatriates in your language classes; it's always helpful to know you're not alone. If you make friends with locals, you will catch onto the language that much faster.

, In the best of schools they will give you at least a year before they set your grades. Because of your lack of fluency in the language they will not be able to really grade you so at the end of the year, you'll have 75 in literature even though you got 13 on the exam.

, It will help you relax and meet new friends. Join an art club or athletic team. Skateboard or go for a run at the local park. Enjoying the same hobbies you did at home helps you from feeling overwhelmed and connects you with others who enjoy the same things.

, It will often make you nostalgic and will disrupt your new way of life. Embrace your new life, be positive, and enjoy your clean slate. Remaining in the past will only negatively affect your future.

, Pets instinctively understand how a person is feeling. A pet is another responsibility but it will help you gain more confidence and get you out of the house. Your new pet could help you make new friendships with other pet owners.

, Food, mannerisms, language, and clothing will all be different. Different doesn't necessarily mean bad. Focus on similarities, and try to embrace the things that are new. The younger you are when you move, the easier it will be to adjust to and learn new languages and customs.

Take stock of baby items you have.,
Set aside baskets and crates.,
Hold on to your storage jars.,
Use an existing dresser.,
Work with existing blankets and rags.,
Set aside a space for baby in a corner of the room.,
Make toys with what you have.",How to Make Room for a Baby in a Small Apartment1," If this is not your first baby, begin by identifying any existing baby items you have, even if they have been used for other things, such as cloth diapers being used as rags.If you are unsure about needing or wanting any of your baby supplies, set them aside for donation. Small spaces don’t allow for lukewarm feelings about baby items.;
, Baskets and crates are excellent for storing the many things that come along with having a little one, so round up every storage container you have. Store baby items in baskets and crates on top of dressers, bookshelves, or mounted shelves to minimize clutter and keep your space tidy.If you don’t have baskets or crates, most thrift stores boast a hefty number of both. Visit your local secondhand store to find baskets and storage containers such as crates and jars that best suit your home and storage space.

, Storage jars range from mason jars to left over jam jars. Hold onto your leftover glass jars, and use them for baby bottles (mason jars have several options for nipples and sippy cups), hair bow holders, and homemade baby food jars. Baby items stack up quickly, so having a place to store all of your baby’s necessities is pivotal.


4-ounce mason jars make great baby food storage jars, as do old baby food jars and small, reusable yogurt containers.
If you do not have storage jars, you do not have to rush out to buy some; instead, gradually hold on to any jars you accumulate over the coming weeks and months.

, Instead of trying to squeeze a new gadget into your limited space, create a small baby changing station on top of a dresser you already own. Instead of purchasing a new dresser, you can set aside a drawer (or even half a drawer) of your own space to place the baby’s clothing in.If you find that your baby’s clothing will not fit in the dresser you already have, you can hang small shelves above the changing station to store socks, onesies, burp cloths, and other necessities.

, Dedicated swaddling and burping rags are not strictly necessary. You can make use of blankets and rags you already own. Swaddling is ideal with square blankets, and burp rags should be soft enough to wipe a baby’s delicate skin. Search through your blankets and towels to find suitable options.If you truly do not have any suitable blankets for swaddling, stick to the basics, and purchase 2-3 muslin swaddles. These can be used as swaddles, nursing covers, and floor blankets for tummy time.

, If you live in a studio, or don’t have a room set aside for a nursery, create a “nursery” in the corner of your room. This can include a crib and a changing station, along with under-crib storage containing your baby’s clothing or diaper items.Nesting hits many moms in the 3rd trimester. If you do not have a dedicated nursery, setting aside a small corner will help curb nesting instincts.

, Your baby does not need all of the latest toys with sounds, buttons, and lights. Most children are happy playing with pots and pans, wooden spoons, and other things you have lying around the house. Limiting your toy intake will ensure you aren’t swimming in baby products, and will give your child a chance to engage in imaginative play."

Repair a Wobbly Post


Secure the fence post using temporary wooden braces so that the post will not wobble as you dig around the bottom.,
Reinforce a decaying post.,
Replace a decayed post.",How to Repair a Picket Fence2,"
Dig a hole around the base of the pole that is 8"" to 12"" in diameter. Dig until you reach the bottom of the pole.
Examine the hole to determine whether the fence post was set in dirt or concrete.
Pound the post further into the ground using a sledgehammer if the post was set in concrete. The distance between the old concrete foundation and the ground should be about 6"".
Pour concrete into the hole. The concrete should come slightly above ground level.
Shape the surface of the concrete using a trowel so that the surface angles down from the fence post. This will allow rainwater to run away from the base of the post and will prevent rot.

,


Dig a hole next to the rotten post. Determine whether the post is salvageable or if the post needs to be replaced because of extensive rot.
Insert a shorter post into the ground next to the damaged post if the post does not have significant damage.
Bolt the posts together, making sure that the bolts are secured to solid wood.
Saturate the rotted area with a wood preservative to keep the rot from spreading.

,


Remove all of the nails that attach the stringers to the damaged post.
Swing the sections of the fence at least two feet away from the damaged post.
Prop the free sections of the fence on wood blocks to ensure that they do not pull away from other undamaged posts.
Remove the rotten post. Lift carefully, particularly if the post was set in concrete. Posts set in concrete can weigh 100 pounds (45 kg) or more. Discard the post.
Insert the new fence post into the hole.
Pour concrete around the base of the pole until the concrete is slightly above ground level.
Shape the surface of the concrete using a trowel so that the surface angles down from the fence post. This will allow rainwater to run away from the base of the post and will prevent rot.

Purchase diapering tools.,
Have enough clothing to last one week.,
Buy as you go, not years in advance.,
Install multiple-use pieces.,
Use collapsible strollers, high chairs, swings, etc.,
Borrow what you can.",How to Make Room for a Baby in a Small Apartment2," Diapering tools cannot be done without, so make this a priority. Diapering necessities include a one-week stash of diapers (for disposable diapers), or 15-20 cloth diapers, wipes, rash cream, and a diaper pail.


While some stores will have various gadgets such as diaper warmers, these are not necessary, and will clutter up a small space.
Be sure not to skip a diaper pail. A small space can be overwhelmed by the scent of soiled diapers quickly.

, Babies do not need wardrobes packed full of clothing items. Have enough clothing to last your baby one week, in addition to special items such as warm hats, sun hats, coats, swimsuits, and mittens. While the baby aisles lining most stores would suggest otherwise, a week’s worth of clothing will last your baby at least long enough to get another load in the washer.


Having fewer items will mean more frequent laundering. However, more frequent laundering will likely save a lot of stress when it comes to saving space.

, Sales can be extremely tempting, but avoid purchasing things out of season, instead purchasing only what you need at any given time. Having tons of clothes for each stage of your baby’s life will place a large spatial burden on your home, while buying as you need to ensures you have plenty of room for your growing family.Forego newborn shoes. They are unnecessary, and take up a lot of space. Instead, purchase thick, warm socks.

, Avoid purchasing single-use items, and opt for multi-use ones. This could be as simple as using a crib with drawers built in, to purchasing baby bottles that can be used as cups a few months down the road.Many baby strollers come equipped with the ability to carry car seats, then change into regular strollers as your child grows. These will cut down on space.

, Larger baby gear can take up a lot of room, and take over a home quickly. Whenever possible, opt for collapsible items, including strollers, high chairs, and swings. If possible, enlist a simple (small) umbrella stroller, high chairs designed to sit on already-existing chairs, and travel swings.Although umbrella strollers are not safe for use with newborns, you can have an umbrella stroller for 6 months and older, while using a baby carrier for the first six months.
Pack’N Plays can be used in the place of cribs, and some models even have a bassinet and changing table attachment included to further cut down on space.

, To cut down on space, you can borrow gently used items from family and friends. Prepping baby tools this way allows you to take items into your home only when they are needed, and free up space the moment they are no longer necessary.When using secondhand items, make sure all screws, pins, and joints are tight and secure. Over time, screws and nails can work themselves loose and create a safety hazard.

Use the walls as storage.,
Maximize the space under the crib.,
Place furniture in the closet.,
Use all rooms for storage.,
Store baby items vertically.,
Take advantage of over-the-door storage options.",How to Make Room for a Baby in a Small Apartment3," Baby clothes are adorable, so why not use them as decoration? To free up some space in the closet, you can hang your baby’s clothing items on hooks on the wall, along with toys and shoes.Small spice racks can be great for wall storage of smaller items.
Avoid hanging anything over your baby’s crib, in the event of a loose bolt or other unexpected hazard.

, If you choose to use a crib, the space under the crib should be taken full advantage of. You can use wooden crates to store baby books and toys, or small baskets to store diaper supplies and spare clothing items. This space is also great for storing collapsible baby items such as swings and strollers.This space does not have to be dedicated entirely to baby things. If you’ve begun sharing a dresser, you can put your displaced clothing in bins beneath the crib.

, Cribs, dressers, changing tables, and more can be placed inside of the closet in the baby’s room to maximize space and minimize clutter. This is best achieved by first removing the door and corresponding hardware to maximize the entry way.If you prefer to have some privacy in the closet, you can hang a curtain to separate the closet from the rest of the room.
Closets can also be great areas for hidden storage such as shelves and multiple hanging rods. As you store things in the closet, organize everything to prevent clutter and frustration.

, A baby doesn’t need a designated room for storing all of their things. Store things according to use. Baby bottles, bibs, burping cloths, and breast pumps can all be placed in kitchen cabinets, while diapers and wipes can be stored in the bathroom in over-the-toilet storage bins or hanging cabinets.The bedroom really only needs to house your baby’s sleeping arrangements and clothing. Virtually everything else can find a logical home elsewhere.

, Instead of splaying all of the diaper supplies out on the surface of a desk or table, enlist the help of some kitchen storage items, and store baby items in vertical containers, whether that means hanging a vertical storage rack on the wall or placing stacking baskets on top of a cabinet or dresser.Vertical storage affords you the opportunity to be creative. You can repurpose a hanging fruit rack to store diapers and wipes, or a 3-tier cake stand to store lotion, medicine, and other small necessities.

, Hanging storage options range from the small (a single hook), to the massive (a door covering boasting over one dozen compartments). Make your doors work for you and use them to store your baby’s clothing, diapering essentials, medicine, and toys.Door hangers are also available for cabinets, and can be used to store baby towels, rags, and burp cloths.

Repair any nail holes and other minor wall damage.,
Repaint damaged or stained areas.",How to Leave a Rental Unit in Good Condition," Different landlords and property managers may have different expectations for their tenants. Most leases require their tenants to leave rental units clean and undamaged beyond “ordinary wear and tear.”While “ordinary wear and tear” can be hard to define, it generally refers to damage that occurs as a result of regular use of a space or appliance, as opposed to damage that results from carelessness, neglect, or intentional abuse.
Depending on local landlord-tenant polity, your landlord or property manager may or may not want you to repair minor damage to the property, such as nail holes or chipped paint.;
, Make note of any areas that particularly need to be cleaned, such as smudged or stained walls, dirty cabinets, dirty pet areas, and grimy or mildewed kitchen and bathroom surfaces.

, Make a list of any notable damage to your unit, such as holes in the screens, missing or damaged blinds, scratches or gouges in the hardwood floors, chipped paint, or marks on the walls that cannot be easily cleaned off.

, Check your light fixtures, smoke detectors, fridge, stove, and any other appliances that belong to the property in order to make sure that they are working and in good condition.

, This way you can avoid any unpleasant surprises during the move-out inspection. In general, it is the responsibility of the landlord or property manager to make major repairs or replace broken appliances. However, it is the tenant's responsibility to inform the landlord of these problems as they occur., Take out everything that you brought into the house or apartment, including wall-mounted decorations and shelving units. Remove pictures, posters and decals from the walls. Check the closets and cabinets to make sure you haven’t left anything behind.

, Check your walls carefully and remove any tape, nails, picture hangers, or poster gum. Check for dirt, marks and smudges, especially if you have small children in the house. Use a duster to remove cobwebs. Scrub dirty areas with a gentle cleanser and a rag or soft sponge.On latex paints, use a solution of water with a few drops of dish detergent, or a gallon (3.8 liters) of water mixed with 3-4 tablespoons (45-60 ml) of white vinegar.
On tougher oil-based paints, like those used in kitchens, you can use a gentle degreaser.
Use caution when cleaning around electrical fixtures, like light switches and outlet covers. Wring your sponge out carefully before attempting to clean these surfaces. You may wish to switch off your electricity at the circuit breaker before cleaning a dirty outlet cover.

, Use an all-purpose cleaner (like Formula 409) or specialized kitchen cleanser (like Bar Keepers Friend) and a gentle sponge or Magic Eraser to scrub your stove, refrigerator, and dishwasher (if you have one). If you can, remove bins and racks from your fridge and oven and wash them in the sink with a gentle detergent or a solution of warm water and baking soda., Take special care to clean your bathtub, shower, toilet, and sinks. Use Comet or a similar cleanser for plumbing fixtures, along with a gentle scrubber or magic eraser, to clean off soap scum, stains, and hard water deposits. For especially stubborn stains or deposits, you may need to let the cleanser sit for several minutes before you start scrubbing.


A little bit of white vinegar mixed with water is also excellent for removing lime and soap scum., Wipe down your counters and the exteriors of your cabinets with a gentle cleanser and a rag or sponge. Areas around the handles of cabinets are especially prone to getting smudged and grimy. Don’t forget to clean out the insides of your cabinets, as well. For tough spots, use a mildly abrasive mixture of baking soda and water, and scrub with a soft brush., Spray your mirrors and windows with a glass cleaner (like Windex) and wipe them clean with a rag or sponge, making sure not to leave behind streaks or lint. You can also clean glass surfaces with a mixture of white vinegar and hot water.

, You may wish to save cleaning your floors for last, since cleaning walls and other surfaces can create a mess on the floor. Once you are ready, wipe up any wet spots on the floors. Sweep hard floor surfaces clean with a broom and dustpan. Vacuum any carpeted surfaces., Once you have swept, mop any hard floor surfaces with a traditional push mop or a steam mop. In areas that are especially prone to messy floors, like kitchens and bathrooms, you may wish to go over the floor more than once. Scrub any extra stubborn spots with a scrub brush and detergent.Take extra care when cleaning hardwood floors. Ask your landlord or property manager what type of finish is on your floor and get appropriate cleansers before attempting to clean it thoroughly.

, After vacuuming any carpeted surfaces, you may wish to spot clean or shampoo them. Purchase a carpet cleaning solution, like Resolve or Zep. Test it in a discreet area to make sure that it does not damage, bleach, or stain your carpet. Spot clean with a clean, white rag. For cleaning larger areas, you can purchase or rent a carpet shampooer.Some landlords may prefer to bring in a professional carpet cleaning service after their tenants move out, so you should discuss this with your landlord before calling in anyone to clean your carpet for you.

, In addition to replacing the bulbs in your major light fixtures, you may wish to check your appliances (such as your oven and refrigerator) for burnt out bulbs.

, Many smoke alarms are powered by nine-volt batteries, which should be replaced at least once a year. However, if you have a smoke alarm with a built-in lithium battery, you will be unable to replace the battery. In this case, it is the landlord’s responsibility to replace the entire smoke alarm every 10 years or as needed., You can purchase a wall-patching kit for minor wall repairs at most hardware or houseware stores. You will need spackling compound (preferably combined with primer), a putty knife, and some sandpaper. Smooth the spackling compound over any nail holes, small cracks, or gouges in your walls. Wait for the spackle to dry, and then gently sand it down.


Check with your landlord or review your lease before attempting these kinds of repairs. Your landlord may or may not wish you to fill in nail holes and other minor wall damage., If you have made repairs to nail holes or other minor wall damage, or if your walls or trim have chipped paint or stains that cannot be removed, you may wish to do some minor paint touch-ups. Go to your local hardware or housewares store and get some paint color swatches. Compare these to the paint you wish to touch up, and buy a small amount of the paint you think is the best match. Use a small brush to touch up the paint in the damaged or stained area.


Color-matching paint can be difficult. Your landlord may be able to give you the exact brand and formulation of the paint you need.
Check with your lease, landlord, or property manager before attempting to touch up or repaint any surface in your home.

, It is best to write on a blank document, because you can easily add/edit things, but with pen and paper you can organize it easily. Write ""Packing List"" neatly on the front of it. If it is for your whole family, you may want to divide the page in equal sections for each family member.

, If you are making lists, label the top of where each list will be.

, If you are going to be gone for 1-7 nights, you may want to consider bringing 1 shirt, 1 pair of pants, 1 pair of underwear, 1 pair of socks, 1 pair of pajamas, and for women, 1 bra, for each night you are staying. If you are washing clothes, you can pack less. If your trip is longer, consider packing 1 outfit and 1 pair of pajamas for every 3-4 days, assuming you will be washing clothing. Remember bathing suits, cover ups, extra pairs of shoes, scarves, coats, gloves, and other items to keep you comfortable.

, If you are going to spend 1-7 nights somewhere, bring your own shampoo and body wash, unless it's only one night (sleepover), then consider skipping a shower. Remember to bring toilet paper if you are spending over a week somewhere. For every 2 days you will be gone, bring one roll of toilet paper, just in case where you are staying doesn't supply it. Don't forget razors, deodorant, hairbrushes, toothbrush, hair straightener/curling iron, and for women, tampons/pads.

, Books, magazines, MP3's, phones, and CD's all qualify as entertainment. For a quick 1 night stay, you might only want to bring a magazine instead of two or three books, because you won't get around to reading them overnight. Remember, if where you are staying doesn't have a DVD player, don't take DVD's!

, Pillows, blankets, and sleeping bags all should be put down. If you are spending 1-7 nights somewhere, don't plan on washing your sheets. Take what you need for your bed (if it is on a bed or on the floor) and maybe an extra sheet, just in case. If you are spending a long time somewhere, take two sets of sheets and rotate them every other week.

, You'll need something to wash your clothes with for long stays. Check with where you are staying to see if they have cleaners, and if so, what kinds.

, For most people, this should be your wallet or purse and a passport, if your leaving the country. If you are just spending the night, you may want to take no money because you probably will not have to buy anything.

, If you have any pills you have to take, write these down. Make sure to take bandages, vitamins, and pain relievers wherever you go, unless its just a sleepover. Remember things like First-Aid kits, motion sickness remedies, and sleep medications.

, MP3 and Cell Phone can go here or in the entertainment section. Remember a cell phone charger, camera, alarm clock (if you need to wake up at a certain time), laptop, and walkies-talkies if you need these items.

, Sunscreen is a must for almost anywhere you go. Tents, sleeping bags, flotation items, beach towels, buckets, shovels, and things of such are good for spending time at the beach or camping. Remember insect repellant and flashlights for camping.

, Wipes, diapers, baby powder, 'sippy cups', and strollers are good for young kids.

,, Did you remember everything or did you put on some extra items? Cross off and add on what you really need. Remember that if you are traveling far, you can buy some things when you get to your location.

, Most people go to moving sales to find trinkets, used furniture, or new clothing.If you have specialty items that are worth a lot of money, a garage sale may not be the best place to get rid of them. In fact, if the item looks especially expensive, it may even get stolen. Consider selling them on Craigslist or auctioning them off on Ebay.

, The merchandise is the most important, but there are other items that are a close second. First, you need at least one trash can for your customers, especially if you plan on selling drinks or snacks. It’s easier to sell electronics if you have easy access to an electrical outlet; then, customers can make sure your products can turn on before they buy them. Lastly, provide plastic grocery bags for your customers. This allows them to carry items more comfortably and hopefully encourage them to buy more!


Using grocery bags can also prevent theft. If you see someone walking away with an un-bagged item, you’ll know they haven’t paid for it. If you see this happen, loudly ask if the person has paid yet. This will usually embarrass the shoplifter and they’ll leave the item where they found it.

, The first step to selling your merchandise is making sure it’s legal to sell. Depending on what region you live in, you may need a permit to host a moving sale. This information can usually be found on your city’s website.If you’re still unsure about the legality of a moving sale in your area, call your local information hotline.

, Most people come to moving sales looking for great deals. If your item costs more than 1/3 of the retail price, it’s unlikely that anyone will buy it. While deciding what to charge, try to price your items in increments of one dollar.Most people don’t carry around change anymore, so a difference of 25 cents can make or break a sale.


Display your prices clearly. People are generally more likely to buy items if they know how much it costs.Consider offering some kind of bargain to your customers. For example, if you have a lot of old books, you can give your customers a discount if they buy more than one.

, You don’t want to go through all the trouble of setting up a garage sale only to have your profits stolen! If you decide to use a cash drawer to store your funds, make sure a trusted friend or relative is next to the drawer at all times. If a cash drawer sounds too risky, consider a money bag that clips around the waist.


Have change on hand. Not many people carry around correct change so you want to be well stocked. For example, if you’re selling your items in increments of one dollar, make sure you have a lot of dollar bills.
Consider using a credit-card swiping device. These are readily available in many electronics stores and can be linked to your bank account. Don’t miss out on sales just because someone doesn’t have change!

, Make large, weather resistant signs and place them around your neighborhood. However, make sure you get permission before you put it in someone’s yard! The date and time of the moving sale should be clearly listed in large, legible letters. If there’s room, list some of the more popular items you’ll be selling, such as outdoor furniture or baby clothes.


Raise awareness using social media to attract the largest possible customer base. Websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Craigslist can be useful when attracting younger people.
Conversely, consider taking out an advertisement in your local paper’s classified section. Many older people use the newspaper to find garage sales.

, Most people get paid at the beginning of the month. If you host your moving sale during the first weekend of the month, you’re more likely to sell more stuff. Furthermore, try not to host your sale during a rainy weekend or a holiday. If you do, you might not sell as much as you’d like.


Saturdays and Sundays are by far the most popular days for moving sale shoppers. If you need to host it another day, you may not see many customers.

, Instead of casually dumping items into boxes, try to attractively display your merchandise on tables. Add some flair by putting colorful tablecloths or scarves underneath everything and arrange the items in striking displays. Group the items into reasonable categories so that shoppers don’t have to search around for what they want.If you have a lot of kids toys to sell, consider having a “kids area” on an old carpet. Post a sign saying that kids can “test” the toys while their parents shop. Most of the time, the kids will fall in love with a toy and ask their parents to buy it!
Display clothing on clothing racks so it's easier to browse through.

, If you sell inexpensive bottled water, sodas, and snacks, customers are more likely to linger at your moving sale.If it’s hot, see if you can provide some shade by setting up a canopy. Lastly, play some soft music to create a nice atmosphere.


If you’re anticipating a large crowd, ask a trusted friend or family member to run the refreshment booth for you. Otherwise, you may not have time to watch your merchandise and help customers with questions.

Be wary of much lower estimates.",How to Hire a Moving Company," If you’re relocating from Arizona to New Jersey, you will likely wish to hire a moving company experienced in moving across state lines. If on the other hand you are moving from one urban neighborhood to another, look for moving companies that cater to people who live in your city.;
, One good way to begin your search is through word of mouth recommendations from friends, family, and coworkers. While researching these companies is still an important step, having a rough idea of which are competent and which should be avoided can save you a lot of time.

, Call one or two local real estate agents and ask if they can recommend a moving company. They have likely assisted many of their customers moving in or out of your current area.


If you have at least three recommended companies at this point, you can skip to Researching a Moving Company. Return here for more ideas if those companies aren't satisfactory.

, Use a copy of the local phone book or yellow pages to search under ""Moving"" for possible companies to investigate. The companies listed should have actual addresses in your area, and are much less likely to scam you than the companies you find on an internet search.If there are too many companies to research, narrow it down to companies that have been in business for at least ten years. Many listings will have a ""founded,"" ""est.,"" or ""since"" date that will tell you when the company was created.

, If you don't have at least three companies to research, or if the companies you found by other methods turned out not to suit your needs, it's time to search online. Search for ""moving company"" plus the name of your city or area, but be cautious to avoid online scams. Every company website should display an address in your area, and you should never enter personal information or pay a fee to access the site. Research companies found online with special care, as described in the next section.


Avoid sites that claim to find a mover for you. These are usually scams trying to take your money or personal information., You may be tempted to hire a ""moving broker"" that claims to arrange a good deal for you. Unfortunately, at least in the United States and the United Kingdom, moving brokers are not subject to the same consumer protection laws that prevent ordinary moving companies from scamming or mistreating their customers.It's best to avoid moving brokers entirely and stick with hiring a company yourself.

, Look up the company's name on sites such as movingscam.com or Yelp. You might find a recommendation, a rating, or a warning that the company engages in scams or bad service. Try to search on several well-known websites to get more information. If it sounds like the company may have scammed people in the past, cross it off your list.


You may not wish to trust the Better Business Bureau, which has been accused of raising ratings in exchange for money., The company website is usually listed in the phone directory, or easily found through an online search. If the website looks amateur, is difficult to navigate, or doesn't contain the information you need, you might want to look for a more professional company. At a minimum, the website should clearly tell you:


The company's full name. If this is different than you expected, or if there are multiple names listed, search for additional reviews to make sure it is a real company.
The address of the company. Never hire a company with no address. A large company with multiple locations may have an address look-up to find offices near you.
Contact information, including a phone number and email address.

, Ask for at least three references from the company, making it clear that you are asking for past customers. Call each of these references and ask for details of their moving experience. If a satisfied customer hired one truck to move a few blocks away, it might not tell you much if you are planning to move a thousand miles away.

, In the United States, companies that transport cargo across state lines, and some that work within a state, are required to have a USDOT Number and Motor Carrier license number.These may be displayed on their advertisements or website, or you may need to ask for them via email or phone. Use a motor carrier lookup site to see if the company is legitimate.


If the USDOT records say Out of Service, or if the contact information doesn't match what you are using to communicate with the company, you may be dealing with scam artists.
The Motor Carrier records should include a safety rating. Look for a ""Satisfactory"" in the companies you hire.

, Have the moving company's employees been professional and polite during your communications? Have they responded promptly to your emails (the next business day or sooner), or have they been making you wait? If a company is too busy or too incompetent to communicate politely with a potential customer, you may not want to hire them.

, Once you're sure a company is legitimate, it's time to find out about pricing. Contact the company to request an on-site estimate, in which the company sends an employee to examine your belongings and estimate how much the move will cost. Ask for a ""binding"" estimate if possible, which will clearly list the cost of each service. A ""nonbinding"" estimate could become significantly more expensive when the company actually charges you.The exact laws governing binding and nonbinding estimates vary between states and countries, so look up laws in your area if you want to be sure what the estimate tells you.


Show the estimator everything he needs to make an accurate estimate. This includes closets, basement, the backyard and sheds, and anywhere else where movable goods are stored. If the estimator doesn't make a thorough examination, don't trust the estimate.

, Read the fine print carefully to work out how much the move will actually cost. Ask the company to disclose all fees, including fees for moving certain items, packing and unpacking each carton, or using additional packing material if a carton comes apart. If the fees seem unreasonable, move on to another company.


In the United States, each moving company is required to have a '""tariff"" which lists these fees in full., Ask the movers for information on valuation or liability, which will tell you how much the movers will owe you if items are damaged or lost during shipment.A moving company may offer several valuation services at different prices, and if you do not specifically sign a document agreeing to one service, they may try to charge you on a more expensive plan.Some valuation services are included at no extra cost. However, these may only provide you with a small percentage of the damaged item's value. For instance, the Released Value plan, required in the U.S., provides only 60¢ per pound of weight damaged, no matter how much the item was actually worth.
More comprehensive plans may require the movers to replace, repair, or pay for damaged items in full. However, these typically cost more and may be limited to certain expensive items. Be sure to list every item you want covered on the valuation agreement., If one company gives much lower cost estimates than its competitors, don't jump on the opportunity without doing your research. This could mean an inaccurate or dishonest estimate, or lower quality service that could damage your household items. In the worst case scenario, it could be a scam that steals your possessions or holds them ransom for additional fees.

;
, Two months before your move, keep track of all your mail and make a list of people, subscriptions, and organizations that should be notified of your changing address. Don't forget about your bank, your broker or investment companies, your insurance agent, your doctor, and your vet. Just before your move, contact the postal service for a change of address form.

, Make another list that includes all the contact information for your utility service providers (telephone, gas, electric, water, cable, and Internet access). To save even more time, you can transfer your utilities online. Remember to contact your pest control, lawn care, window cleaning and other services to let them know about your move. Proper planning insures that you won't be paying for services you're not using!

, If you're using a professional moving company, make yourself available to answer questions on both ends of the move - loading and unloading. Review the home inventory paperwork and make sure the driver has your contact information and details of your delivery.

, Whether you're hiring professionals or moving yourself, remove all rugs, low hanging items, and tripping hazards. Keep walkways clear at all times. Arrange for someone to take care of your children and pets while everything is being packed and loaded onto the moving truck.

, Label boxes in detail, including contents and the room in which they belong. This will save time and questions for you and your movers.

, When you arrive at your new residence, your essentials box will be first thing you unpack. In it, you'll want to include items like:


Alarm clock
Aspirin or pain reliever
Basic cleaning supplies and paper towels
Bedding and linens
Box cutter or knife
Change of clothes
Coffee maker or instant coffee and tea
Disposable plates, cups, and eating utensils
Extension cords and batteries
First-aid kit
Flashlights
Garbage bags
Light bulbs
Map of new area
Medications and eyeglasses
Pet supplies
Phone book for new area
Plastic trash bags
Scissors
Screwdriver and hammer
Shower curtain and towels
Snacks
Tape and dispenser
Toilet paper
Toiletries (soap, shampoo, razors, etc.)
Toys and games for the kids
Work gloves

, Charcoal lighter fluid, pesticides and paint thinner are a few of the items that professional moving companies won't touch. Make arrangements to transport these items or leave them with a neighbor. Valuables such as cash, jewelry and important documents should stay with you or be shipped via trackable shipping service.

, Before the moving van leaves, make sure everything is loaded or unloaded - on both ends of your move. Check the attic, basement, closets, and garage for things you may have forgotten. If something is damaged during the move, notify your moving company immediately and take photographs of the damaged item. Review your home inventory before the moving company leaves..

, Moving can be manageable, with the right attitude and thoughtful preparation. It will all be over soon - and you'll have days, weeks or even months to unpack at your leisure. Throw yourself a housewarming party and meet your new neighbors.

Ask your local schools if they have boxes to give away.,
Do some browsing at your local recycling center.,
Talk to friends and family members.",How to Get Free Moving Boxes1," Most stores break down and recycle their cardboard boxes, and if you ask to speak to a manager you will probably have a good chance of walking off with as many free boxes as you can carry.


Look specifically for produce boxes. For example, apple crates are sturdy and can help you move heavy or fragile items.;
, Bookstores, liquor stores, restaurants, office supply stores, hardware stores and electronic stores will be happy to give away their boxes after they have unloaded merchandise.


Find out on which days shipments are received. You will have better luck at the end of those days, when trucks have been unloaded and everything unpacked.

, Professional buildings and companies receive shipments too. Boxes that hold reams of paper are especially useful because they have lids.

, The cafeterias might have food boxes and the administrative offices might have supply boxes they would be happy to get rid of.

, People often leave their boxes anywhere that recycling is collected.

, Everyone notices when someone new moves into the neighborhood. They might be able to collect recently used moving boxes for you.

Check Craigslist.,
Look for boxes on Freecycle.,
Visit the U-Haul message board.",How to Get Free Moving Boxes2," Under the ""For Sale"" heading on your local Craigslist page, you will see a subheading that says ""free."" That page should include ads from people who have just moved and are giving away their boxes.


Post a Craigslist ad if you do not see any ads for free boxes. Listing an ad is free, and all you have to do is say you are looking for boxes to use for your move.

, The Freecycle Network (www.freecycle.org) puts people who have things to give away in touch with people who need those things. Cardboard boxes are almost always featured.


Type your location into the search box and you will get to your local page, where you can search ads for cardboard boxes or place your own.

Learn the layout.,
Learn the neighborhoods.,
Look online.,
Consider getting a roommate.,
See the place in person.,
Sign the lease.",How to Find a Place to Live in LA1," LA is divided into four main quadrants - East Side, South Side, West Side and the Valley. Each quadrant holds many different neighborhoods and each has its own distinct feel. Figure out which quadrant you want to live in, then research neighborhoods in that area.The Valley has a more residential, suburban feel and is at least 10 degrees hotter than the rest of LA. It includes neighborhoods like Reseda, Studio City, Burbank and Woodland Hills.
The East Side is more affordable and diverse and includes neighborhoods like Downtown, Echo Park, Los Feliz and Atwater Village.
The West Side is expensive and much closer to the ocean. It includes neighborhoods like West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Santa Monica.
The South Side is the most dangerous and the least convenient. It includes neighborhoods like Inglewood, Long Beach, El Segundo and South LA.;
, The first step to finding a place in LA is narrowing down the neighborhoods you’re considering. As LA traffic is notably terrible, it’s a good idea to live close to work or other places you’ll be frequenting regularly.Culver City averages $1,950 for a one bedroom and is great for singles.
Atwater Village averages $1,399 for a one bedroom, $2,400 for a two bedroom and is great for people with kids.
Koreatown averages $1,450 for a one bedroom and is great if you like a city feel.
Santa Monica averages $2,800 for a one bedroom and is great if you want to live near a beach and are comfortable having a roommate.
Downtown averages $2,650 for a one bedroom and is great if you hate driving.
Echo Park averages $1,160 for a one bedroom and is great if you like being outside.
Silver Lake averages $1,880 for a one bedroom and is great if you consider yourself a hipster.

, Even if you don’t currently live in LA, you can check out available listings through one of the many sites that offer them. Pay $60.00 to sign up for West Side Rentals to receive instant e-mails regarding availabilities. Utilize sites like Craigslist and Rent.com every day.Padmapper.com allows you to search listings by zip code and city.
Zillow.com lets you see prices by neighborhood, but is a better resource for those looking to buy property.

, There are many benefits to having a roommate: you split the costs of living, you have someone to hang out with and with two people looking, you double your chances of finding a great place to live.If you’re choosing to live with a roommate, make sure it’s someone you can get along with and who has a similar lifestyle to you.
If you’re looking remotely, see if you have any friends in LA who are looking for a roommate. If not, chances are that someone you know who lives there knows someone who is looking. Ask around, post on social media, do whatever it takes to get the word out.

, Once you’ve narrowed your search down significantly, it’s time to see the places in person. Ideally, you would do this by planning a trip to see them yourself, but sometimes that’s not feasible. If this is the case for you, send a friend who already lives in LA to scope out the places on your behalf.Have your scout take notes and photos and send them to you for you to peruse. Have your scout give you insights, but know that the decision is still ultimately your own.
If you don’t know anyone in LA, you will have to take a trip yourself. Try to pack as many neighborhoods and apartment tours into your trip as possible, in order to make the most informed decision.

, Once you have selected a new place to live, it’s time to make it official. If you can, sign the lease in person while visiting the city. If you can’t, have your future landlord or realty company e-mail you a copy of the lease. Sign it electronically and send it back.Read everything before signing. If you’re not sure what you’re reading, give it to a lawyer or friend to look over as well.
Keep copies of everything. Print out and save a copy of your lease and any other important documents. Also save e-mails between you and the landlord, in case you should need to reference them later.

Scope out neighborhoods in person.,
Read the newspaper.,
Hire a realtor.,
Attend open houses.",How to Find a Place to Live in LA2," If you know what neighborhood you’re interested in living in, drive, walk or bike around the area. Look for “For Rent” signs, and if possible, inquire within.Make a list of all the things you “want” to have in your new place and all the things you “need” to have in your new place. Make sure any place you see has all the things you need before committing.
Trust your gut. If a place feels too good to be true, it probably is.
If no one is at home, try leaving a business card with your information. They may not call you back, but it’s worth a try.

, Before the Internet, all home and apartment vacancies were listed in the classified section of the newspaper. Purchase a local paper, and while you’re at it, drop in on some local coffee shops and businesses. Sometimes people will hang listings on bulletin boards or by the front desk.Check social media. Oftentimes, it’s easier to rent by reference, rather than listing an apartment online. Even if you don’t know someone well, chances are a mutual friend will be able to put in a good word for you.
Try looking on Reddit. The front page of the Internet often has apartment listings for the greater Los Angeles area., Renters do not have to pay realtors; the person renting the property pays that money. With that said, realtors have a wealth of knowledge and their expertise can come in handy when looking for a new home.Even if you choose not to hire a realtor, you can call a realtor to verify an owner’s name, so you don’t end up getting bamboozled.
Rental agents are often the first to know of a new property, so they are excellent resources for getting started.

, Look for open houses online and attend any that seem interesting. LA is a very competitive market, so open houses are usually crowded and aggressive. Renters frequently make offers at open houses, so attend each open house armed with the following materials:A renter resume, that includes credit score, your household income and occupation, any pet information and your rental insurance policy info.
A completed rental application.
A copy of your credit report.
A copy of your driver’s license or state ID.
Proof of income.
A checkbook. Make sure you have enough money in the bank to cover the cost of first and last month’s rent, plus a security deposit.

Determine your budget.,
Look into short-term housing options.,
Research potential neighborhoods online.,
Get comfortable with compromise.",How to Find a Place to Live in LA3," Los Angeles is an expensive city and moving is not cheap. Determine your monthly rental budget, as well as your budget for utilities. Most landlords require first and last month’s rent, as well as a small deposit. Once you know how much you can afford to spend, your search will become a lot more focused.Budget $200 for utilities in LA.
Factor in a $1000 buffer – this amount will cover unexpected expenses like buying a fridge (which is sometimes necessary), as well as covering renter’s insurance.

, If you’re having trouble finding a place, don’t panic. Look into subletting a place short-term, staying in a family or friend’s spare room, renting an apartment month-to-month or using Airbnb or a hotel to secure a room.If you can, check Craigslist multiple times a day. New listings pop up every minute and you don’t want to miss one.
Word of mouth is your best form of advertising. If your friends and family know you’re looking to rent, they can connect you to other people who might have openings. Tell everyone you know what you’re looking for – you never know who might be able to help you out.

, Learn everything you can about the neighborhoods you’re looking at. Google or Yelp potential landlords and realty companies to make sure they’re legit. The better informed you are during your search, the better chance you’ll have of successfully securing a new home that you’ll love.Use Google Street View to check out streets and neighborhoods from the comfort of your own home.
Use GoogleMaps to estimate commute times.Use CrimeMapping to check the safety of the neighborhoods you’re looking into.

, With an area as competitive as LA, it’s almost impossible to find everything you’re looking for in an apartment, especially if you’re on a budget. Be realistic about what you absolutely need and be willing to compromise on everything else.Ask your LA friends to weigh in on your options. They’ll be able to give you good feedback on whether or not your prospective place is a good buy or a waste of money.
Be flexible about things like space and size, but be rigid about your rights as a renter. If you feel that you are being taken advantage of, get out while you still can.

Repeat all steps until the pump is primed and functioning normally.",How to Prime a Water Pump," No device should be left on if you're fiddling with it. Turn off any and all electrical power to the pump and system at the breaker panel. You can also go to the base of the pump to make sure it's turned off.;
, On a pool pump, this will be the strainer basket. If you're not working with a pool pump, use whatever fixture is closest to the water tank.

, Check all piping and fittings for any cracks,, or damage, especially if system was shut down over the winter. Check each drain plug to see if it needs re-tightening, and manually operate any valves. Ensure that all nuts, bolts and anchoring fasteners of the pumping system are in place and tightened properly. You should also inspect any safety guards, belts and pulleys that there might be., Flush the hose to remove any build-up and ensure you have clean water. Run water through it, keeping a constant stream for a few seconds before you shut it off. This is especially important for hoses that aren't routinely used or haven't been used yet this season.


Many people choose to use their garden hose or their washing machine hose connected to their garden hose. However, if your garden hose contains lead, know that you shouldn't drink from it. If you're using this for a well, be sure you have a way of filtering the water before and after it's through the hose.

, This will keep pressure from building up. Watch your water pressure gauge to make sure all is going according to plan.

, On a pool pump, place it in the strainer basket. If you're priming a water pump for a building, just connect it to the fixture nearest the water tank. You now have a source of water flowing into the new building or pool.

, At the beginning, you'll hear air flowing through the system. This is normal.

, You should hear water filling the tank or, if you have a water pressure gauge, notice the level rising. On a pool pump, fill the strainer basket and close its lid.

, Once you see water coming out the opposite end, you can turn off the turn off the water to the hose. This should take but a few minutes.


When the water stops flowing on the opposite end (where you're trying to get the water to), the water system has been pressurized.
However, don't disconnect the hose, just in case you end up needing to repeat the process.

, Allow it to run for about a minute. Do know that the pump might not run if the water tank pressure is at or above that pump's cut-out pressure. if it doesn't start, that's why.


If you have opened relieve valves, wait for water to begin seeping from them and then close them.

, If it turns off naturally, it is primed. If not, you need to prime again. Try turning the water on at the recipient source. If you hear the water pump turn on, you're good to go.

, In certain circumstances, you may need to repeat this once or twice more.


If you have a water tank that is the steel bladderless type, try leaving the tank drain open at the start of the procedure. This way incoming water can enter the tank by pushing air out of the drain. However, when you see water coming out of the drain, close it.

Get a solar power system.,
Have a backup power supply installed.,
Reduce your energy usage.",How to Live off the Grid1," Off-the-grid living requires that you develop energy-independence for your home. The best option is to retrofit your home with solar panels. Consult a solar power installation company in your area to get a better idea of how you can connect your home to a solar panel system.Total installation costs of an average solar power system – including solar panels, a battery, a backup generator, and professional installation – averages around $40,000.
The costs will vary slightly depending on the number of kilowatt hours you intend to consume. If you intend to live a more energy-intensive lifestyle, you’ll need more solar panels and a larger battery capacity. Thus, your initial investment in energy independence will be larger.;
, A backup system can supplement your solar panels, which can come in handy on cloudy days. If you’re near a river or creek, you could get a micro hydropower turbine installed as a backup system. Otherwise, you could get a wind turbine installed near your house. Talk to renewable energy companies in your area about your options and, if you wish, get a backup system installed.A domestic wind turbine costs around $10,000.
Micro hydropower turbines have a wide range of costs. A small one can cost around $7,000, while a large one (which produces more power) can cost over $55,000.

, Since you’re using electricity off the grid, it’s important to take steps to ensure you don’t use too much power. To keep energy costs low, replace incandescent bulbs with fluorescent bulbs. This simple change can reduce electricity use by 75%. Additionally, turn lights, TVs, and other appliances off when you’re not using them."

Gauge your personal comfort level before heading to Slab City.,
Prepare for a primitive lifestyle.,
Plan ahead.,
Find your way there.,
Once you arrive, find space.,
Get situated.,
Learn about surviving.,
Plan trips to Niland sparingly.,
Keep a level head and kind demeanor while living at The Slabs.",How to Live in Slab City," This type of living isn't for everyone, and you'll need to rely on survival instincts to make it each day.;
, Since you simply cannot run to a shower house, flip on ESPN or hit the gym, you must mentally prepare yourself for life away from civilization. This means you'll need to learn food growing, basic survivalist skills and mentally training yourself to live with literally nothing more than what you choose to bring.

, The new paradigm in primitive living is to plan ahead, unlike the days when you had a Swiss Army knife and some clothes. Several items would come in handy should you wish to remain technologically engaged with society: a small or medium solar panel charger, small rainwater collection kit (water stowage), a tent large enough to stand and not feel cramped up in, a means to cook food, at least two weeks worth of easy-to-carry rations and either a consistent financial source, or the skills to barter. Remember––you'll be living outside of a city that is relatively small and without much work.

, Niland sits on California Highway 111, which runs near Interstate 10. You can also take the Route 86 South exit off I-10 as 86 joins 111 near Mecca, CA. From Niland, take Main Street until it joins Beal Road; once you pass Salvation Mountain, you're just around the corner from The Slabs.

, The area is considered 'deserted territory' by the United States government;however, those living there have set up their own camps, so find space that is a comfortable distance from your nearby neighbor. Many 'courtesy' rules exist at The Slabs, such as allowing perennial RVers the courtesy to have the same spot, although these rules are not enforced since they, essentially, cannot be enforced because nobody owns the land.

, If driving, you'll probably want to set up camp near your vehicle to allow others the opportunity to have space; if walking, perhaps 'mark' your territory with a flag, stick sign or something similar. Set up your tent, prepare your bedding, then start mingling with the locals, in order to learn more about The Slabs and their 'community courtesy rules'.

, Many kind folks may have rations to give or loan from time to time, yet it's ultimately your responsibility to feed, water and bathe yourself. Ask if different outposts have been created to help people learn about survival. Again, The Slabs are not governed by any specific body, and nobody can do more than to ask you to leave their particular campsite.

, If you can hitch a ride with someone to town every couple of weeks to gather rations or water, take the opportunity to do so. If hitchhiking back and forth, you should only carry what you can, and maybe make several trips each week.

, Although most individuals are down to earth, rude and disruptive individuals are dealt with, most of the time not very kindly.

Drill a well.,
Get a septic tank installed.,
Have a greywater system installed.",How to Live off the Grid2," Since you won’t be connected to a central water system, you’ll need to use well water. Getting a well drilled will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of around $7,000.

, A septic tank is a watertight chamber that collects sewage in the absence of a sewer system. Having a septic tank installed generally costs around $5,000.The septic tank will need to be emptied by a vacuum truck periodically.

, A greywater system will treat water used in dishwashing, sinks, showers, and baths so that it can be used again. While it’s less of a necessity than a septic tank or a well, greywater systems can extend the lifetime of your well by allowing you to use water that has already been pumped up to the surface.Recycled greywater can be used as irrigation, bathing, or toilet water.

Grow a garden.,
Go hunting and fishing.,
Gather food from your environment.,
Scavenge food from dumpsters.",How to Live off the Grid3," Growing your own food is the best way to survive off the grid. Even if you can’t grow everything you want or need, you should at least be able to supplement your diet with fruits and vegetables raised with your own sweat and toil., Hunting, trapping, and fishing can provide protein for your diet. You could use either firearms or -- if you like a challenge -- you could use a hunting bow to procure wild game., Wild berry and fruit trees can offer an abundant source of ready-to-eat food during the summer and fall. Doing so can save you time, money, and energy.Obtain an illustrated botany book that explains which fruits, nuts, and berries grow naturally in your locale.

, Dumpster diving can yield substantial volumes of perfectly edible food. Identify grocery stores with accessible dumpsters. Using a headlamp and a pair of gloves, lean or jump into the dumpster and search for edible food. Avoid anything that looks or smells spoiled.Ensure that your local laws allow dumpster diving. In most jurisdictions, dumpster diving is legal, but some places frown on it.
The best time to dumpster dive is after dark when the store is closed.
In addition to food, you can often find hygiene products, electronics, toys, books, and many other perfectly usable goods in dumpsters.
Always leave the dumpster and the surrounding area in as neat and clean a conditions as you found it.

Check property listings online. Contact realtors about homes that pique your interest. Visit a few homes to get an idea of what each one offers and how easy it would be to take it off the grid.You might choose to live off the grid in a tiny house, a trailer, a cabin, or a similar domicile.

, Custom-built rural homes are, by their very nature, sure to meet your needs. These days, many companies specialize in building tiny homes or other off-the-grid housing.

With a little patience, though, you’ll be able to get land in the area you want.

, If you cannot find land that fits the requirements you’re looking for and don’t want to put in the time and energy to build your own off-the-grid home, try joining an off-the-grid community that welcomes others who want to share their lifestyle. There are off-the-grid communities around the world. Search online to find one in your area.Off-the-grid communities are a good choice because they allow you to live the way you want while allowing you to maintain connections with other people.
These communities vary in the amenities they provide or allow. Some have no electricity at all, while others use renewable energy to power their homes and buildings.

Meet your neighbors.",How to Get Organized After a Move," For an apartment, one or two weeks should do the trick, but if you've just moved into a house you should expect to take about a month. It is important not to procrastinate unpacking--the sooner you decide to get it done, the more likely it is that you will actually do it., Make a list of all the rooms in your new home—any bedrooms, bathroom, the kitchen, the dining room, etc. Make a short list of the pieces of furniture and types of belongings you plan to keep in these rooms. Be sure to assign each room a clear purpose—not just “extra room” or “general storage."" This will go a long way in helping you consolidate your belongings., Cleaning before you begin unpacking rather than afterwards will ensure a much better experience as you will be able to identify and access problem areas much more easily.


Clean the sinks, bathtubs, and showers.
Vacuum the carpets and the refrigerator vent, which can become a hazard due to the buildup of dust.
Clean the furnace.
Dust the lighting fixtures, especially the ceiling fan blades.
Clear the dishwasher filter.
Sterilize the washing machine and clear the dryer's lint trap and its slot., Make sure that all of your boxes and pieces of furniture are accounted for and intact. The sooner you know that something has gone missing or been damaged, the more likely it is that you will be able to fix it.

, This will create space for you to unpack your smaller objects in an organized manner, and also give you a much better idea of where you want everything else to be stored.


Place the most cumbersome objects, like couches, tables and storage units, first. Try to keep most seating spaces and storage units against the walls to create an open space in the center of your rooms, and consider placing tables close by somewhere to sit whenever possible.
Make sure that when have a concrete plan as to what you intend to keep inside each of your storage units before you place them. This will minimize clutter and disorganization., You'll want a trash bag for discarded tape and packing peanuts, bubble wrap, or other protective materials during unpacking, and a pair of scissors for cutting boxes open. Making sure these tools are accessible right away will prevent you from having to frantically search for them later, when you really need them., Unpack your essential kitchen appliances and any perishable foods. Moving and unpacking requires a lot of energy, so even though you will be very busy over the coming weeks you need to make sure you are able to eat whenever you feel the need. Be wary of relying on takeout—it will sustain you for a little while, but it doesn't have as much nutritional value as other, healthier foods., Unpack your sheets, pillows, pillowcases and blankets, and make your bed. Make sure you have a change of clothes comfortable enough to sleep in. You will be extremely tired after you are finished moving all of your things, and if you fail to prioritize what you need in order to sleep, you may find yourself exhausted with nowhere to collapse at the end of your first night., It won't look good if you're late or absent from work during the days following your move simply because you can't find your toothbrush! You don't need to break out your razors and lotions right away, but you should have at least a few necessities on hand.


Put any medicines that you regularly use and your set of keys in a safe, accessible place right away so that you don't miss a dose or accidentally lose an important key.
Unpack your toiletries; moving might be a time-consuming process, but it is still extremely important to maintain personal hygiene so that you can continue to keep up with your life outside of your new home.
Make sure you have at least a couple of changes of clothes available, even if you decide not to unpack the rest of your clothes right away, so that you can go out with your friends and attend your job even though most of your possessions are packed away., Prioritize! You are going to want access to the most important things right away so that you don't have to go without them for very long.


Unpack the most frequently used items first, like your entertainment systems and the clothes that are currently in season.
Get to out-of-season and other rarely used items last; that way, after the first couple of days of unpacking, it won't do any harm to rest for a couple of days before starting again.
Wait to decorate until you are completely finished with everything else—when your home is otherwise completely in order, you will have a perfect idea of where your decorations should go., It is important to know if any problems exist in your home; after all, you can't do anything to fix them unless you know they are there! If you discover any of the following issues, immediately contact your realtor or leasing complex for assistance.


Check for obvious cracks or serious inconsistencies in the bases of the walls; these could indicate a problem with your foundation.
Check the ceilings for water damage; water damage marks indicate a leaking problem.
Check the bathrooms and basement for mold.
Investigate the age and condition of your furnace, stove, dishwasher, and refrigerator.
Save any home system or appliance manuals and keep them in a safe place, like a drawer in your kitchen set aside for this purpose., Create an evacuation plan for extremely dangerous natural disasters. Agree with your new housemates upon an escape plan in the event of a fire, or familiarize yourself with your living complex's emergency protocol. Know where your local fire station and police station are and how to contact them in the event of an emergency., This includes gas, electric, cable, internet, water, and any security or trash collection services you may require. It is important to get this done as soon as possible; living without the means to cook, stay warm, bathe, or entertain yourself will create a lot of unnecessary stress which will doubtlessly interfere with your attempts to organize yourself after your move.

, File change of address forms with the post office and update your address with your banks and your credit card, insurance, and utility companies. It is also a good idea to update the address on your driver's license, voter's registration, and car registration., Make the first move and introduce yourself to your neighbors! Taking initiative can be a little nerve-wracking, but it will paint you in an extremely flattering light. One of your neighbors could be your new babysitter, job lead or even best friend, so it's always prudent to start forming connections."

Decide how far away you want to be.,
Choose your level of communication.,
Reduce waste.",How to Live off the Grid6," Living off the grid doesn’t mean you need to be hundreds of miles from civilization. You could choose to move to a plot of land that is isolated and rural but still within easy reach of stores, hospitals, and family.On the other hand, you could live in a totally self-sufficient home or trailer far from anyone else.The distance you choose to remove yourself to depends only on your preferences and personality.
Travel to a number of different locations before selecting the site of your off-the-grid homestead., Living off the grid typically means dramatically reducing your level of interaction and communication with the outside world. However, the degree to which you choose to do this varies depending on your own personality and desires. For example, you could choose to get rid of your phone, computer, and radio altogether. Alternately, you might keep your radio, but ditch your phone and computer.There is no right or wrong way to decide how to limit your level of communication.

, When living off the grid, all you energy, food, and water use should be carefully monitored and maintained. The more of these precious resources you use, the more reliance you will have on others. Easy ways to reduce waste include:Keeping your showers short and don’t water your lawn.
Unplugging appliances when they’re not in use.
Turning off the lights when exiting a room.
Learning to love leftovers. Start a compost pile so you can get some use out of unused food.

Use your hobbies to make money.,
Turn your knowledge of off-the-grid living into financial opportunity.",How to Live off the Grid7," Your off-the-grid lifestyle will be more secure if you are able to pay for upgrades, repairs, or other things when you need them. To ensure you’re able to do so, save as much as possible before going off the grid, and continue to save wherever possible after going off the grid.Since every off-the-grid person has different needs and expenses, it is impossible to know how much any particular person should save. A good general rule, though, is to have at least six months’ worth of income saved.

, Even if you’ve started out your off-the-grid lifestyle with a large nest egg, you should work to buy only what you need and save as much money as possible. This means, for instance, finding alternative forms of recreation and entertainment. Instead of going to a concert or play, you could watch a film or read a book at home.Avoid buying alcohol, cigarettes, makeup, and other nonessential items.

, Once you’re living off the grid, you’ll be able to save lots of money that would normally go towards utility bills. This will allow you a prime opportunity to quit your job or cut back your hours at work. You could then turn your hobby into a moneymaking enterprise.For instance, if you’re a seasoned cross-stitcher, you might want to sell your cross-stitched designs online or at a local farmer’s market.
If you’ve always enjoyed writing, you could devote yourself more fully to writing and start publishing a monetized blog or write articles for online publications.

, Many people are interested in living off the grid. If you wish, you could monetize a blog, produce videos, or write a book about your experience of living off the grid. You could also host others in a kind of off-the-grid exchange program."

This means less ""nature"" for us to play in and wildlife to live in and more.;
, This will really decrease the amount of waste you put into landfills each month. Menstrual cups are easy to use and very portable. Cloth pads take a little more effort, but less than you might think. And, while reusable products are a little expensive at first, in the long run they save you money. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloth_menstrual_pads)

, Use a three ring binder and take notes on the back of paper that needs to be recycled. Recycle after it has writing on both sides. This will save energy that goes into recycling and slow global warming.

, Keep them in your car so you don't forget to bring them. Alternatively use the plastic grocery bags as trash bags for small cans. Some stores will take bundles of plastic bags for recycling.

, Most food in those stores is more expensive but the bulk bins and bulk spices are often cheaper than grocery store equivalents and use less packaging.

, Many fish are over harvested or their capture has negative impacts on ocean ecosystems. You can download a regional seafood guide from the Monterrey Bay Aquarium at bins. They are a great place to begin exploring meat-free options such as textured vegetable protein., Reusing things instead of throwing them away will result in less garbage in landfills and less resource consumption.

, Toss in fruit and vegetable scraps instead of throwing those items in your garbage. This will cut down on the amount of your garbage, along with providing you eventually with some organic material for your garden or landscape plantings.

, These last far longer and use much less electricity than regular incandescent light bulbs. You can use 120W replacer at Costco. They only use 23W and work TERRIFIC!

Try to use natural light every-when you can in order to save some electricity. For example, if you want to read,you can sit next to a window and use natural day light.


Turn off the light if you are not using it. Turn off everything you don't really need to be on, like your TV if you are not watching, or your laptop if you are doing something else.
This way you will have to pay less for your electricity and you are actually helping the planet.;
, This step is similar to last one. You only have to think about when it is necessary to use water and when it is not. For example turn the water off when you are brushing your teeth, and try not to spend too much time in the shower. Don't shower twice a day and turn water off when you are shampooing or soaping.


You can take a look at this article for some ideas to save water: www.wikihow.com/Save-Water.
Again you will pay less for water and you will help the planet too.

, You don't have to cut off meat of all your meals. However you can eat a little bit less of it. Try to eat more salads and enjoy all kinds of food that doesn't have meat in them and are quite healthy.


Meat is quite expensive and if you reduce it in some of your meals you will be saving money and actually helping the planet.

, Don't trow to the garbage everything you think you don't need anymore. Before that think about what can you use it for. For example,if you just got from the super-market and you have lots of empty bags, save them in a little box and then take them to the super-market again so you don't have to use new ones. You can do the same with things like paper; try to have a little box where you can put some used paper and re-use it to write little things like a list of what you need to buy at the super-market next week.


It is not about keeping a lot of useless things at home. Try to think about what can you use things for before keeping them. You have to be pretty organized so you can save some money while being green.

, This way you will save LOTS of money that you usually use in gas and you will be actually helping to reduce contamination. You can go in your bicycle to work or school, or you can only use it at weekends to do something different and have some fun if you want.

, If you can walk, and it is not to far where you are going to, walk. Again you will be saving lots of money because you are not using gas and you are reducing contamination.

, buying could be exciting but you have to spend lots of money if you do it, and you are actually consuming too much and that is not good for the planet. So be sure to buy things you need and control yourself while shopping.


You can help some people by donating your old clothes to charity.

, You can begin hanging out in a green way. Like just going to the beach with your friends and drinking some beer. Enjoy the outdoors. This is the best way to save some money while having fun. There are a lot of nice things to do without spending lots of money and you will have the chance to enjoy wonderful and beautiful places.

, This way you are saving paper that would be used by the company when sending your bills at your mail. And you will be saving some of your money too because you won't need to spend in stamps.

, All that junk mail adds up to a lot of trees over time, not to mention clutter in your life. Look for weekly specials online instead.

, Some companies will now send you an electronic bill if you wish. Pay the bill online and keep the entire transaction paperless.

, Borrow books from the library rather than purchase them or purchase the books from a secondhand dealer and return them for an exchange when you have read them. There are other ways to share books around too, such as using a site like Bookcrossing.com where you can leave books anywhere for someone else to enjoy. Less clutter for you, more sharing around of ideas and an excuse to swap an old book for a new one.

, Subscribe to your newspaper online. As a sound compromise, subscribe to an online edition weekdays and only purchase the paper copy on weekends when you have more time to read through the paper. Make good use of the finished newspaper and recycle it.

, The house may be better off being tree-free but the garden should be filled with trees that are appropriate to your climate, soil and living space. Plant them when you can. If you don't have a garden or cannot grow trees, join a local conservation group and help them to plant trees, even if you only have time to do it once a year.

Look at your environment.,
Look for an area in your yard that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight every day.,
Select the plants you wish to grow according to the season.,
Select your plant box or container according to the size of plant you intend to grow.,
Select your soil with care.,
Consider companion planting.,
Consider crop rotation.,
Consider time-delayed planting.,
Use granular fertilizers with care.,
Use seed packets, which can be purchased at garden shops, home improvement centers and other retailers.,
For growing inside the rules are much the same, but there is more to do.,
Harvest.",How to Grow Vegetables in Containers," If you have space, ensure that it is protected from severe wind, heat, chill and sun. Plants have varying needs which means that within a middle zone they will all grow well, but some will struggle and put out poor quality produce or will simply not grow in the more extreme environments.;
, Do not set pots or containers on cement patios if you live in a hot climate. This could make the plants too hot to grow properly.

, Warm climates are lucky as they get an extended growing season. Those with short summers should aim for maximum yield in the summer with the surplus being frozen or preserved for future use.

, Shallow rooted vegetables such as herbs, salad greens, tomatoes, beans and peas can do with low level of soils providing the nutrients are moisture are available. These plants are often grown hydroponically as they will flourish in the right conditions with minimal soil. But keep in mind that root vegetables such as carrots, beets and potatoes will require more space.


The simplest method is to calculate depth 1.5 to 2 times the likely depth of your vegetables, so if you select a carrot variety that typically has 20–25 centimeter (7.9–9.8 in) carrots, a 30–50 centimeter (11.8–19.7 in) depth is recommended
Popular plant containers have been grand & elaborate stone, wood or ceramic affairs, while success has been made with unsealed woven baskets (often sourced from charity stores) or food safe polystyrene boxes. Some people have gone even easier by growing directly in a compost or blended potting mix sack or using old cloth such as sacks or towels suspended like a hanging basket. Plastic containers are not always ideal as they tend not to last very long and can be quite expensive if you buy them new. Old wine barrels are very practical as they are deep and wide to host a range of plants, but you may need to travel a great distance and pay considerably for them, simply because they are popular. It is cheaper to manufacture your own tub and many hardware stores have DIY classes that you can take advantage of.

, The general rule is the better it is, the better the plant health and output you may expect. The recommendation for wet climates is to have a thin layer of gravel or something to allow drainage, topped with a mesh liner (such as old fly screen) and then the soil. The mesh prevents the soil from draining out and staining the floor or benchtop. For dry climates, it is highly advised to get a large plant saucer to hold water and invest in water retaining products such as clay, synthetic water crystals (which absorb and hold water to release it slowly) or good organic matter.


Some landscaping suppliers supply a black looking top dressing mulch that looks nice and rich but it is actually very weak as it is really just for cosmetic use to make your garden look attractive. Ask your supplier for a good vegetable raising soil to be sure you get a good product.

, Marigolds are a good all-rounder to keep most pests at bay, but some some plants naturally don't like each other for a variety of reasons. Tomatoes and potatoes should not be planted together due to similar nutrient needs and many plants dislike fennel. Some plants such as corn & tomatoes share a common pest so should not be planted together as they are a bigger ""bait"" for the pests. But some plants such as basil and tomato are good ""partners"" as they frequently grow better as a pair.

, After the first year, don't plant the same crop in that container, as the nutrient content is far lower. The option is traditional crop rotation so a high nutrient requiring plant (such as tomatoes) are then replaced with a low need plant, such as onions. It is also recommended to plant beans or peas or other green manures such as clover - all these are nitrogen fixtures and help to improve the soils.


Sometimes you can tip all the soils together however this does disrupt the soil ecologies and can improve some but worsen others at the same stroke. Without adding something such as compost, the mixed soil gradually gets weaker and worse each time for growing plants.

, You may plant a box of carrots for example, but if you sow the whole packet at once, you will have a glut of carrots. If you have no wish to preserve these, its recommended to plant the amount you would use in a week, then a week later repeat so you will get a staggered harvest.

, They can quickly build an excess of salts and other chemicals in the soil at the expense of the plants. Use a slow release type conservatively, opting for composted organic matter instead. The same applies to seaweed or fish emulsion tonics which have a high excess of salt - use them often, but in very weak concentrations.


The moment there is evidence of salt crystals forming, you should stop adding any fertilisers and soak the plant containers in a larger tub of water to try to extract the excess. It will weaken the soil overall, but it can be corrected with compost. The alternative is usually throwing the soil away.

, Follow the directions on the seed package.

Transplant vegetable plants that were begun indoors. You can get these plants from garden stores, or start them on your own during the late winter and early spring. Place the plant in the larger outdoor container and cover the roots with soil.

, Indoor plants have the highest risk of problems such as pest infestations, weak stems due to low air movement, low light, plants drying out or being too wet. In moderate climates its fine to put the plant outside every few days to sun harden and be exposed to fresh air. For less friendly climates, you have to be inventive by moving the plant around regularly to get better light exposure, using a small desk top fan to get air circulation and to daily check for moisture by sticking your finger in the soil. If it feels moist its fine, but if it feels wet or dry, reduce or add water as required.

, When the fruits and vegetables are ripe, use clean scissors or garden shears to remove them in order to reduce harming the plant.

Recycle.,
Minimize waste.,
Collect compost.,
Minimize the eco-impact of your trash.,
Conserve energy.,
Use eco-friendly cleaning products whenever possible.,
Think before you shop for food.,
Consider green options when remodeling.",How to Go Green in Your Kitchen," One of the bare necessities in any green kitchen is a basic recycling station. Much of what we normally throw away can be recycled, but check with your local recycling center about any special guidelines or exclusions for organizing and delivering your recyclables.


Set up small receptacles in an accessible area in your kitchen, and make sure to label the receptacles accordingly: paper/cardboard, plastic, glass and aluminum/steel. Rinse glass, aluminum and plastic containers before putting them out for recycling, and discard any dirty napkins or wrappers.
The plastics used in making water bottles, salad dressing bottles, milk jugs, trash bags, disposable plates, and yogurt containers are among the most commonly recycled. However, not all plastics can be recycled, so try to forgo the purchase of any packaging that can't be reused.;
, Many people use items in there kitchen that could be replaced with reusable variations. Look around your kitchen and locate disposable items such as paper towels or plastic bags. Substituting dish towels (which can be cheaply found at yard sales often times) for paper towels and reusable bags may help minimize your impact on the environment.

, Even your everyday food scraps have a place in the big green picture. Whether you've got a full-on compost heap in your backyard or you've only heard of the process in passing, there's a way for your discarded eggshells to help save the planet, and fertilize your garden in the process.


Purchase a small kitchen compost bin, or use any small lidded container as long as it's emptied regularly to avoid odor problems. Place scraps such as coffee grounds, egg shells, fruits and vegetables in your compost container, but avoid dairy products and animal fats. The Environmental Protection Agency provides a comprehensive list of compost ingredient dos and don'ts.


, No matter how green you go, there are always items that can't be recycled or composted. But you can still keep your kitchen garbage eco-friendly.


Because plastic does not decompose in landfills, products such as BioBags offer a biodegradable alternative to standard garbage bags. Or try bags made from recycled plastic; while not biodegradable, you can feel good knowing they have at least gotten a second use. After all, the process of manufacturing new plastic emits more pollutants than recycling plastic to be used again.
Consider going with paper. Paper bags are naturally biodegradable and, though not quite as convenient as their plastic counterparts, still get the job done.

, Use appliances that have the Energy Star logo; this which means you're saving 10-50% more energy over non-approved appliances. Kick that efficiency up a notch by using any conservation settings on your existing appliances (e.g. the ""water saver"" option on your dishwasher).


Plug smaller appliances (coffee maker, toaster, etc.) into a single power strip and flip the switch to ""off"" whenever they're not in use. Or just get into the habit of unplugging an appliance right after using it. Anything that plugs in takes electricity even when the power isn't on. In fact, 40% of the energy that home electronics use is when they're not even on.
Replace standard light bulbs with compact fluorescent (or CFL) bulbs. These wonder bulbs use three-quarters less electricity than incandescent lights, last ten times as long, and you can get them in any style you'd like. If you miss the warm glow of your old bulbs, buy CFL bulbs with Kelvin temperatures of 2,600-3,000.
Add an inexpensive faucet aerator to your kitchen sink. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, water flows through the average faucet at a rate of five gallons per minute (or GPM), but an aerator can cut that number to around 2 GPM. Aerators combine water and air to create high pressure without high water flow. So you'll be able to rinse your dishes just as effectively without excess water going down the drain.
On that note, wash only full loads of dishes, and let them air dry when the cycle is done. Also, there's no need to preheat your oven; most recipes will turn out fine if you turn the oven on after inserting your dish, or if you preheat just a few minutes before cooking.

, This will not only green your kitchen, it will also help you support companies with environmentally-sound goals. Don't know which companies to start with? Try these: Seventh Generation, Mrs. Meyer's, Begley's Best, Method Cleaning, and Clorox GreenWorks.


Make your own cleaning products if you feel up to it. There are a lot of innovative ways to capture the cleaning power of vinegar, lemon juice, and baking soda. For example:
Scrub your toilet with vinegar and baking soda.
Cut through greasy countertops with the power of baking soda.
Use baking soda to get rid of grease and freshen laundry.
Vinegar can clean the bathroom, kitchen, and other rooms throughout your home.



, Just because you make healthy diet decisions for your family doesn't necessarily mean you're making healthy decisions for the environment. Buying fresh fruits and vegetables in the dead of winter may seem harmless enough, but where and how was your food grown, how did it get to the store, and how is it packaged?


Buy locally when possible. The distance your food travels before it lands in your cart (""food miles"") is something to think about, especially when the average produce product travels nearly 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) to get to your table. Think of the energy required to travel that distance, and you'll start to see the environmental cost. Local Harvest provides a search tool for buying locally in your region.
Buy organically when you can. While the intentions behind the use of pesticides is all well and good (controlling and warding off damage to crops caused by pests), the environmental costs may outweigh their benefits. USDA Certified Organic products are, at a minimum, 95% pesticide-free. If you cannot afford the organic price tag, consider going organic on a few staples such as milk, peanut butter, and apples. Also consider buying sustainable foods because they are grown in ways that minimize their environmental impact.
Think ""big."" Ten cents of every dollar you spend at the store pays for product packaging. So take a load off your mind and your wallet by buying bigger quantities. Though those individually wrapped and boxed lunch snacks are cute, choosing bulk instead saves needless packaging and nearly $2,000 annually for a family of four. Also, make your own meals instead of buying pre-made dishes. You save on packaging, and get a tasty meal in the bargain!

, So you're kissing your old kitchen goodbye and starting with a clean slate? If you're ready to remodel, there are green options galore that make as a big an impact environmentally as they do visually.


If there's a salvaged building materials shop in your area that carries tile and stone slabs from previous projects, use them for your new counters. Or opt for countertops made from recycled materials; paper, hemp, glass, and aluminum are a few that meet the ""reduce, reuse, recycle"" standard.
Cupboards are a major focal point in any kitchen, but many you see today contain a harmful form of formaldehyde. Shop instead for cabinets made of solid wood or wheatboard, a material that's typically burned up as waste but can be a great alternative to particle board.
Before you leave the home-improvement store, check your paint can to see if its contents include VOC (volatile organic compounds), which can be harmful to your health. Visit Green Seal to learn which eco-friendly brands perform best. Many wallpaper retailers now carry environmentally sound coverings that don't use VOC or other toxic compounds in their glue.
Anytime you can use eco-friendlier sustainable wood, you're making an environmentally-friendly choice. Consider alternatives such as cork, which is made of re-growable bark peeled from a tree, or bamboo, one of the hottest eco-friendly trends around.
Friendly floors: Though not commonly considered a top-of-the-line renovation product, linoleum is made of natural materials, which has got some people saying it's making ""a comeback.""

Depending on the state of your garage, you may want to bribe family or friends to help out by offering food, beverages and live music. Make sure you set up a temporary space to put everything you take out of your garage.;
, Remove everything out of your garage including cars and pets. Place items in your temporary space you set aside. Clean the garage walls and floor with dusters and brooms. Scare away all the critters and take a look at your brand new space. Do not be afraid to paint your garage a bold color that will make you feel glad to return home from a long day at work or do laundry.

, Create a keep, sell/donate, recycle/repurpose, and trash pile.


Keep. Keep only those items that you need and use regularly. Visualize your nice clean garage if you are having trouble letting go of some items.
Sell/Donate. Sell or donate items that you have not used in the past year. You can sell or donate those ""to be fixed"" items if they are in fairly good condition and are not dangerous. Check out charities and local organizations that will pick up your items from home. You can also sell your items in a garage sale or on sites like Amazon, eBay, or Craigslist. Your garage may be where your year end bonus was hiding.
Recycle/Repurpose. Many items in your ""Trash"" pile, like metal, plastic, paper, wood or glass items can be recycled. Please help out mother earth and check out the following links for recycling old paint, hazardous chemicals, batteries and electronics. In fact, many cities have free electronics recycle days and many stores take back electronics and batteries. Check with your local government to see what items the city recycles and upcoming recycling events. Think of reusing items by turning them into lawn/garden art or totally re-purposing them into something new and useful around your house.
Trash. Trash items that have been labelled ""to be fixed"" but have remained in disrepair for the past year and are dangerous.

, Take a good look at your empty garage. Now visualize how you need to use your garage on a daily basis. Start placing the items, grouped by terms of use (e.g. all like things together or all activity based objects together). For example, place all gardening tools together in one place close to the door because you garden every morning. Some example categories include gardening, recreation/sports, hobby/craft, laundry/cleaning supplies, tools, holiday decorations, long term storage, etc. Think about the best way to store each group of items in terms of how often you need access and who needs access to them. Choose storage units that are the proper size and shape for each group of items.


Use the best organizational tools for your space and budget. Some suggestions are ceiling mounted storage, wall mounted peg boards, hooks, utility shelves, wall-mounted shelving units, or re-purposed furniture (like bookshelves, crates piled up or nailed to the wall, or an over toilet storage cabinet).
Line up bins and crates along the garage wall to set up your home recycling system. You can recycle as much or as little as your lifestyle allows. Some recycling category suggestions are to create bins for paper/newspaper/cardboard, bottles (if your state has a take back policy), plastic containers, electronics, batteries, or compost.
Label all storage bins on at least two sides, and face the labels out when stored for easy access to the items within.
Organizational materials can be found at any home improvement store, dollar store, thrift/antique store, or even around the house.
Be sure to think about the space you will need for your car and ensure there is sufficient room to open car doors.

, In order to maintain all your hard work, train each family member on the organizational system. It will take two or three or more times for each person to remember to return the items to their assigned space in the garage. Once everyone knows and helps with the system, keeping your garage space organized will be a breeze. Schedule a biannual declutter of the garage. If all else fails, call in a Professional Organizer.

Obtain a building permit.,
Get the necessary wood.,

Find the remaining supplies.,
Get the right tools.",How to Build a Pole Barn1," You will need to check with your local municipal and\or county building and\or planning and zoning to get a building permit before you do anything. Call or visit their offices to find out what you are required to do to get a building permit, and then go through the process and obtain your permit before you build anything.
, In order to build a pole barn, you will need to start with the right wood. The name “pole barn” can be slightly misleading, as you have the option of not only using poles but also square posts as well. You also are not limited to the construction of a barn, but any outdoor structure you would like including sheds, workshops, and garages.


You can use regular square posts, round poles, or old utility poles to build your structure. If you would like, you have the option of using logs you’ve felled or found on your own. Whatever wood you use, make sure that it is pressure-treated and rot resistant so that the integrity of your structure is not placed in jeopardy.
You will need 2x4s and 2x6s to frame the structure and add the roof trusses and lumber for the roof framing.
Use plywood to create the walls. You have the option of adding wood siding on the outside of the plywood to give added appeal to the appearance.

, Most pole barn roofs are made from metal roofing, because they are inexpensive, easy to install, and last a long time. A metal roof is also much better than shingles or rolled roofing if the structure is large, especially in areas where it snows. However if you don’t find metal roofing aesthetically pleasing, you have the option of installing shingles.


Make sure you have rust resistant roof metal for the roofing. You will also need a ridge cap to cover the center of the roof.

, You will need concrete to place around the poles in the ground, as well as gravel to create a level ground-layer and provide drainage. Use a portable mixer if you are placing many poles. You will also need galvanized screws, screw-in and straight roofing nails, and storm clips to keep your nails anchored. You can use bolted plates to attach the poles together instead of cutting notches in them as well.

, Part of the attraction of building a pole barn is the simplicity involved in putting it together. You don’t need a lot of tools, but have the option of buying/renting some bigger machines to aid in the building process.


You will need a tool to use to dig the holes for the poles. You can choose between using a post-hole digger or a tractor-powered auger. The latter is obviously less time consuming, although it is much more expensive to rent. Another option is to check for a truck mounted hole drilling service in your area.
You will need a laser-level and carpenter’s level, an electric drill with the attachment for roofing screws, a hammer, a miter or circular saw, and a hand saw.
You have the option of renting a backhoe for this project, although it is not required. You can also use a large tamper to help level the post-holes for the poles."

Check with your municipal or public agencies to make sure you have a free area to construct your French drain. In the United States, you can call the 811 ""call before you dig"" hotline, which will connect you to your local call center.Also be sure to plan your drainage route so it runs at least a meter away (39 in or about 3') from any walls or fencing, and try to avoid any posts, shrubs or tree roots.Other things you must take into account: the source of the water you will be draining, the greatest amount of flow you can expect to get, and if it is a hazardous or contaminated source.;
, Some municipalities have rules on whether you can build or even dig on your own property. Speaking with city and/or county officials and working together is in your best interest for this project. It can be frustrating to have to go through government channels to do work on your own yard, but you must remain patient and polite if you want to get this project done. Stay organized and develop a good relationship with these agencies.


In order to get your French drain project going, you may need to contact your local government office or board of officials. It may seem crazy, but even the smallest earth-moving projects can require complicated sign-offs by local government groups. Know the regulations and covenants in your neighborhood before you start planning anything.
You will also need to establish whether or not your French drain would cause hardship for neighbors in terms of groundwater runoff. Running excess water onto someone else's land could lead to a potential lawsuit.
Ideally the French drain should runoff in a relatively unused section of land, away from any buildings, into sandy soil which allows water to pass through easily.

, In order to work well, your French drain needs to be constructed on a slight downhill grade. This allows water to drain away from the problem area through the force of gravity.


If no natural downward slope exists, you can create a slope by digging progressively deeper as you work your way along the trench. Experts recommend a 1-percent grade for the French drain to be effective. In other words, you should allow for a drop of one foot per every hundred feet of drainage (roughly one inch per ten feet of run).
Use landscaping paint to mark out the path of your proposed trench line, then use a couple of stakes, a length of string and a string level to gauge the incline from one end of the trench to the other.If you're not able to figure out the right pitch for your French drain on your own, you can hire a surveyor or other professional to help pin down the right dimensions and placement for your drain. You can still do the work yourself, but you may be more secure in the knowledge that someone else has signed off on the plan.
Another option is to rent a transit level (if you know how to use one).
Remember that the ditch depth and grade doesn't have to be perfect, but you want to ensure that there are no ""bellies"" in your drainage, or areas in which water can pool and be held.

, In order to build a French drain, you'll need to stock up on a few basic tools and materials. You will need:



A roll of water-permeable landscape fabric: this will help to keep your drain pipe clean and avoid clogging by preventing soil, silt and roots from entering the drain. You can also purchase an ADS perforated pipe that has a fabric sock around it.

A perforated plastic drain: the diameter of the drain will depend on the extent of the drainage problem and the size of the trench. You can opt for either flexible drain pipe, or for rigid PVC drain pipe (which is more expensive but sturdier and easier to unclog). Make sure the pipe is big enough to carry all of the flow gathered along the run.

Washed drainage gravel: the number of bags will depend on the size of your drain. Use an online gravel calculator to get a rough estimate based on the depth and width of the planned trench. Some projects will require more than gravel by the bag. Reach out to sand and gravel companies and inquire about delivery if you need large amounts of rock and/or gravel.

Tools: If you plan on digging the trench manually, you will need a spade or digging hoe. Otherwise, you can rent a trenching tool or hire a backhoe operator. Make sure the backhoe can cut a trench that is deep and wide enough for your pipe — most walk-behind trenchers only cut a 4 to 6 inch wide trench.

, Digging the trench is the least complicated step in building a French drain, but it is the most labor intensive! Enlist the help of a family member, friend or neighbor if possible.


The width and depth of the drain you dig will depend on the severity of the drainage problem and the digging tool you're using. However, most standard French drains are approximately 6"" wide and 18"" to 24"" deep.Trenching tools will cut wider trenches (which is ideal for more severe drainage issues) and will cut the digging time in half. However, using a trenching tool will also increase your costs as you'll need to pay for the rental and buy additional gravel to fill the larger trench. Trenching machines can be very difficult to control and operate and are extremely dangerous. If you don't know how to use this equipment, it's best to allow a professional to do this or use a hoe. If you do use a trenching machine, ensure that no one gets close to the the chain when the machine is operating.
The same goes for hiring someone to cut the trench for you with a backhoe, as backhoes cut very wide and deep trenches and will incur both labor and rental costs.
Periodically check the depth of the trench as you dig, to ensure it is consistently sloping downwards.

, Once you have finished digging the trench, you will need to line it with the water-permeable landscape fabric.


Leave at minimum 10 inches (25.4 cm) of excess fabric on either side of the trench, if not more. Remember that this can always be trimmed later, and that the fabric will be pulled down when you fill the trench with rock. You want to ensure that you have enough fabric on the sides to fold over the drain rock so that it does not contaminate and plug the pipe.
Temporarily pin the excess fabric to the sides of the trench using pins or nails.

, Shovel approximately 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) of gravel along the bottom of the trench, on top of the landscaping fabric.

, Place the perforated drain pipe into the trench, on top of the gravel. Make sure the drain holes are facing down, as this will ensure the greatest drainage. , Shovel more gravel over the pipe, until there is 3 to 5 inches (7.6 to 12.7 cm) between the gravel and the top of the trench.


Then unpin the excess landscaping fabric and fold it over the layer of gravel.
This will prevent any debris from entering the drain, while still allowing any water to filter through., Fill in the rest of the trench with the displaced soil. At this point you can finish the trench in whatever way you like:


You can lay sod on top, reseed with grass or even cover with a layer of large, decorative stones.
Some people even build the drain pipe with a slight curve, so it looks like an intentional design feature upon completion.

Measure the space.,
Determine if there will be water and electricity going to the building.,
Remove any obstacles in the area.,
Level the ground.,
Create a string-line.",How to Build a Pole Barn2," Before you start building, it is imperative that you get an accurate measurement of your space. This will help you to buy an accurate amount of supplies and reduce the stress in building.


Walk around your space to decide how wide/long you want the barn to be. Once you’ve gotten a general space marked off, take exact measurements and keep track of them on a notepad.
Decide how high you want your structure to be. If you plan on using it as a garage or a storage shed, a minimum of 8 feet (2.4 m) is required. You can build it as tall as you would like though; just remember that you will have to work on the roof from the tops of the poles once they are in the ground.
Make sure that the area you choose has good drainage to avoid flooding in the rainy season.

, If so, then you will need to hire someone to set these up. You will also need to call 811, the national Digline to have utility companies come out and check for pipes and wires underground., Pull out any shrubs or trees in the space where you plan on placing your structure, in addition to a 5 foot (1.5 m) wide space around it. If you have grass down, use a sod-cutter to remove it and cut it away in pieces. It can be replanted in another area of your yard if you desire, or be used to start a compost pile.

, Make sure the area you are working with is level. It is easiest to use a tractor to do this, by moving soil from one area to another. You can do this manually though, especially when the area you are working on is already pretty level.


Check to see if any base rock is needed to build up the floor of the barn. If so, then add 4 to 6 inches of decomposed granite or a similar type of smaller, easily compacted gravel material for a dirt floor and drainage.

, You do this to mark the outline of the building you plan on making. This will make laying out the post-holes much easier, and help to keep the structure in perspective during the beginning stages. Put a small stake in each of the four corners of your building, and then wrap a long piece of string or twine between each stake."
"
Dig the holes.,
Mix your concrete.,
Even-out the height of the poles.,
Add the roof-support beams.,
Build the trusses.,
Add additional boards for support.,
Add the siding.,
Install the roof.,
Add doors or windows.",How to Build a Pole Barn3," For this, you can use your tractor-powered auger or your post-hole digger. Depending on how high you want to build your structure, you will need to make the holes at least 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 m) deep. Many experienced builders say the pole needs to have 1/3 of its length in the ground, especially for an open-sided pole barn.


You don’t have to build a foundation for a pole barn, but it is vital that your posts are stable so that even extreme weather conditions and accidents won’t move them. Be sure to consider the primary wind direction and build accordingly.
Measure your poles or square posts to see how wide you need to dig the holes. Make sure to add a few inches of width to the hole so that the posts are guaranteed to fit.
Keep your poles no more than eight feet apart. You need your structure to be strong by keeping these foundation poles close enough together that they aren’t each forced to subjected to too great of a load. However, you can also research larger pole barn plans, which may require placing the poles further apart than eight feet.

, You will need enough to add 12–24 inches (30.5–61.0 cm) in the bottom of each hole depending on the size of your poles. Tamp the inside of each hold to make the bottoms of each as flat and sturdy as possible. Drop each pole inside the holes into the concrete to add stability. Make sure that they are completely vertical before leaving them to set.


Make sure that you have staking and bracing material for two sides of the poles to keep them in place. It is important to prevent them from moving.
They will need to be left for 2-3 days to give time for the concrete to set completely. This way you don’t run the risk of accidentally knocking the poles over before they have been stabilized.
Make sure the corners are exactly square—at 90 degrees—and the spacing between the poles is exact, so that you won’t have problems completing your pole structure later.

, Even if your poles were all exactly the same height when you started out, because the holes are not all the same size your poles are likely uneven now. Use a laser-level to mark off the tops at the same height.


Use scaffolding or a sturdy ladder to climb to the top of each of the poles and remove the excess height. You can do this right before you install the roof support beams.
If you would prefer not to climb the poles afterwards to measure them, you have the option of inserting each pole in the hole before concrete, measure the distance on the base, removing them, and then cutting them to size. This requires a lot of labor hauling the poles in and out of your post-holes though., These are the first and most difficult horizontal boards to place. You can choose to cut notches to fit the boards in each of the poles or place them across the top using metal plates. Use your level to make sure the boards are parallel to the ground, and secure them with screws or lag bolts to make sure they are stable.


These are the boards that connect between each of the poles, making a giant rectangular shape.

, The trusses are the triangle-shaped roof beams that will be placed width-wise across the roof-support beams. These will have a board that runs parallel to the ground, as well as two additional boards that meat in the center at an angle. Measure the base-board to fit across the roof-support beams, and then choose the angle at which you want the roof to slope.


Miter the edges of the upwards-angled boards so that they meet flat together at the joints.
When they are put together, lift them up (with the help of others) onto the roof beams. Use metal plates to secure them to the base, lining them up over the poles.
Add a beam down the center for added support.
If you are building a larger barn, then check with a local truss company for costs of building trusses, delivery, and crane service for setting them.

, You will need to nail boards across the roof and between the poles for the siding to be attached to. Be sure to use a level to make sure they run perpendicular to the boards they are nailed to.


The number you use will vary depending on the size of your structure but at least one additional board should be placed on each section.
If you plan on adding walls, nail 2x4s along the perimeter of the structure at the base. This will give the siding something to attach to on the bottom.
Consider using one size bigger board that has been pressure treated and that is at least 6 inches off the ground to protect from rotting.
Add boards between the beams to act as studs for a door or window. Create a frame for a door by nailing together boards in the shape and size you want, and cutting out any excess pieces.
If you are going to build any stalls, feed or tack rooms, or feeding mangers with in ground posts, then use pressure treated boards for framing that can come into contact with ground.

, Although you can choose to leave the sides of your barn open, adding walls is easy. Take your plywood and cut to size. Nail it to the support boards along the outside edges of the building. To take it one step further, you can add wood siding on the outside to make the building look nicer.

, If you chose to use a metal roof, then your pieces should be cut to fit. Install them by tapping the screws in place over the struts, and then use the drill (with roofing attachment) to finish inserting the screws. If you use shingles, nail down plywood over the entirety of the roof, and then layer the shingles and attach them with 3-4 nails apiece.


You usually need to put down a felt or tar-paper underlayment before the shingles.

, If you added extra support and framing for a door or window, you can add it to the barn at this point. You can also choose to leave it as an open-air door or window, which is common for pole barns."

Be positive.,
Manage your time wisely.,
Get organized.,
Ask questions.,
Find you passion.,
Make your decisions.,
Find motivation.",How to Find a Path in Life," You need to look at your choices with a good frame of mind. If you don't look for a solution to your problem, it will be difficult to find it. There are many different ways to help you achieve positive energy. You can try yoga to clear your mind, go and bring a blanket to the beach and relax, read a good book while drinking hot chocolate, a nice bath,...etc. Whatever that will work for you to get your spirits lifted before deciding to make important decisions about your life. This is important especially because the consequences of making lousy decisions just because you felt upset or helpless when you made them-can be potentially dreadful.;
, As we all know, we don't have forever to live in this world. If there is a certain dream you want to follow, don't wait until your actions to fulfill your dream are to late to have an effect. I am not saying to be a daredevil, just that it is okay to test your abilities that you want to develop.

, If you have lots of ideas on what path you want to take in life, you are normal. You are definitely NOT alone. If you like writing you can buy a journal to help you organize your thoughts on paper. Sometimes it all comes to place when you can visually see your goals on paper laid out for you. If writing is not your thing, don't lose hope. You may find that by telling someone close to you about your indecision, you can clarify your choices and then make a decision easier. If it is a career that you question, do as much research on the internet or from the library as you wish.

, It may feel a lot better if you talk to someone that is knowledgeable about the specific goals you want to achieve before making final decisions. If this isn't possible, you can write down a list of questions you want to be answered regarding the goals you want to achieve. Who do I need to contact? What qualifications do I need for this path? Where do I need to start? Remember that the process it takes to find the answer is just as important as the answer itself.

, You need to love the path you are taking in order to be truly successful. Something that makes your heart feel warm and makes you smile. Don't dread over money and decide the path you take solely because of the income it would provide. If you will be miserable with that path, what does it matter if you got so much money from it? Money doesn't buy happiness. It could help, but it shouldn't solely decide your dreams.

, Eventually there always comes the time where you need to have your plans take action. What are you waiting for? Don't do something that you will regret later. Make a list that can show you the pros and cons of everything you've got to be familiar about. Take your time with this process. It is better to take a few extra hours to think it over well, then a few extra years to make up for a mistake.

, Motivation is not something you should overlook. Find what is best for you to get motivated. Listen to inspiring people, hear upbeat music, read, go out and visit interesting places...etc. Motivation comes from anywhere and yet it makes all the difference to see your dreams coming to life.

, Just because you want to go green doesn't mean you need to cut back on the good times. Green events still enable you to celebrate and be healthy and environmentally-friendly at the same time. You can even Have a Green Wedding!

, There are many, many things you can do to minimize the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Basically, the less we depend on fossil fuels, the better!

, If you have access to some land, maybe you can Practice Sustainable Agriculture. If all you have is a balcony, you can still grow things like beans and peas, tomatoes, and herbs in pots. And if all you have is a window, become a guerilla gardener: find a patch of dirt anywhere in your neighborhood and plant stuff there. Whatever you can't grow, support your local farmers and buy it at a farmers' market.

, Consider whether you can Live Without a Car. At first, you might think it's impossible, but there are so many other ways to get around these days. If you can't part with your car, consider buying a hybrid, using biodiesel, and hypermiling. Replace as much of your car use as possible with the following:


a bicycle

public transportation
good old walking

carpooling

, Look for ways to Save Water around the house, and encourage others to do the same. You can also save water outside the house with a sleeping lawn or by xeriscaping. In addition to using less water, take steps towards keeping the water we already have nice and clean: How to Reduce Water Pollution. If there are any leaks in the faucet, fix them immediately.

, In a consumerist society, it can be difficult go for even a day without buying anything. When you do buy stuff, try to make sure it's stuff that will last a long time and can serve multiple purposes; avoid buying disposable items when possible. Also, consider the ""greenness"" of the company that made it! Before throwing anything away, try to find creative ways to reuse it. You'd be surprised what you can do with old Altoids tins, socks, plastic bags, plastic bottles, and, well, everything.

, You can certainly be green without wearing green. The first rule is to never throw clothing away; always donate it to a charitable organization so it can be reused by someone else. But before you even part with a garment, try to think of ways you can revamp it and give it a little extra mileage. There are more than 20 ways you can give a t-shirt a makeover. A pair of pants can easily become a purse. So can a bra, for that matter. Even a trip to the tailor can turn a poorly fitted garment into a flattering outfit. When you do go shopping, favor thrift stores.

, Communing with nature is more resource-friendly than going to the movies or restaurant or mall. Instead of traveling with an RV, why don't you Go Canoe Camping? Instead of getting McDonald's or Wendy's, why don't you find nature's munchies? Instead of staying at a hotel, why don't you pitch a tent or a hammock?

, Consider downsizing your home so you have less space to heat or cool and less room to fill up with stuff you really don't need. If you want to be extra green, Start Living in a Tiny House, Camp As a Lifestyle, or Live in Your Car!

Understand that building a pole barn is straight forward and pretty much as simple as it gets.,
Build an 8 x 16-foot (2.44 X 4.88 meters) structure with a shed roof that is 8 feet (2.44 meters) high in the front and 6 feet (1.83 meters) tall in the back.,
Start building the pole barn by laying out the location of the posts on the ground that drains well and is relatively flat.,
Dig the post holes a minimum of 2 to 4 feet (.,
Set the treated 4 x 4-inch (10.16 X 10.16 cm) wood posts into place, bracing them to keep them plumb.,
Tamp down the dirt as you backfill.,
Attach a treated 2 x 6-inch (5.08 x 15.24 cm) wood skirt board around the bottom of the back and sides of the pole barn if you have it open in the front.,
Add another 2 x 4-inch (5.08 x 10.16 cm) grit on the side level with the one you placed against the bottom of the stringer at the back.

,
Use 2 x 6-inch (5.08 x 15.24 cm) wood for the roof rafters that sit on 4-foot (1.22-meter) centers.,
Fasten metal hurricane hold-down straps to the posts and to the rafters to prevent high wind gusts from pulling the roof off of the support posts.

,
Overlap 29-gauge galvanized corrugated roofing panel by 2 inches (2.12 cm) to the skirt board, stringers and grits.,
Finish with preformed foam sealer strips that fit between the roofing and joist.",How to Build a Simple One Horse Barn," It is built with poles that are 4 x 4-inches (10.16 x 10.16 cm). These protected posts, or utility poles, are set in a grid 8 feet (2.44 meters) apart.;
,


The barn, depending on your location, can be enclosed on 3 sides (or with half of the front covered).
Another choice is to open it on the side, facing the sun in winter. This way you will have prevailing winds for summer cooling of the horse.
Make the roof from fiberglass or sheet metal. Both of these come in varying lengths and are 26 inches (10.14 cm) wide. The wall cladding is the same material used for the roof.

, Make sure you keep the posts square to each other when you lay out the post locations. Remember, it is in 8-foot (2.44 meter) grids. You will need 6 post locations for an 8 x 16-foot (2.44 x 4.88-meter) shed.

, 61 to 1.22 meters) deep and 1 foot (. 3 meters) wide. Opt for the measurements to be 4 feet (1.22 meters) deep if your climate has a lot of freeze and thaw cycles. Moderate climates require 2 feet (. 61 meters).

, Pour a premixed sack of concrete into the hole around the post, up at least 1 foot (. 3 meters). Wait a couple of days for the concrete to set and then backfill the remainder of the way with dirt dug from the holes.

, Keep checking as you go to ensure your post is square. Use a string line run on the back and front to keep the center post in-line.

, Run a skirt board on one side of the front if the ban is to be closed off. This is usually an 8-foot (2.44 meters) section of the front.


Use 2 x 4-inch (5.08 x 10.16 cm) wood grits, or lattice board, 2 feet (. 61 meters) apart from the bottom of the skirt board to the top of the wall on 3 sides.
Opt for 2 x 6-inch (5.08 x 15.24 cm) treated wood board all around the outside of the pole barn for the roof frame to sit on the top grit.
Set the stringer top edge (on the side wall section) 6 feet (1.83 meters) from the ground. Now raise the front end up to the 8-foot (2.44 meters) mark on the front.
Cut the post off flush with the roof stringers.

,, Nail the 2 x 4-inch (5.08 x 10.16 cm) wood flat on 1 end.

,,


The holes are pre-drilled and use special #12 2-inch (2.12 cm) metallic steel hex drill-point roofing screws.
Cut to fit using a circular saw fitted with a metal cutoff blade on the sloped sides.

, Add doors to the front, if needed, by building a 2 x 4-foot (. 61 x 1.22-meter) frame. Use the same sheet metal as the roof and walls, and hang it from the post.

Pick a spot over the ditch where you would like to cross over.,
Figure out how wide you want your bridge.,
Purchase CCA treated lumber.,
Dig up the ground up to a foot (or more) where you marked the 4 corners.,
Cut your 2x4's to length, 3 or 4 foot (0.9 or 1.2 m), make sure they are even.,
Cover up the posts  and pack it tight.,
Test it out.",How to Build a Drainage Ditch Bridge," Try to find a spot where the two sides are closely even, level, and ""clean"". Also make the sure spot is less than 6 feet (1.8 m) across. If more than 6 feet (1.8 m), this bridge may not be for you.;
, A 3 foot (0.9 m) bridge is good for a walking bridge, but a 4 foot (1.2 m) bridge is wide enough for most mowers. Measure 1 foot (0.3 m) behind the ditch and mark the spot in 4 corners, measuring that all 4 points meet up with each other.

, Cut your 4x6x12 in half to give you two 6 foot (1.8 m) pieces. Purchase approximately 8-10 treated 2x4's, and deck screws. Have your level handy, and your post hole digger or shovel ready as well.

, You will then lay your 4x6's in the holes across the ditch. Try to dig at least 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) in the ground so that the posts are deep enough to be covered up with dirt.  This part can be tricky, as the posts need to be level with each other, and the ground itself. They also need to be even. Measure across, sideways, and add dirt or dig more to get yourself to where you are exactly even, level, and secure.

, Then lay them across the posts one at a time. Separate them about a pinkies length apart to allow for rain to drain through it. Screw two deck screws on each side, and continue laying boards all the way across. Make sure you are even, level, and the boards are staying put. You may need to remove weeds, dig into the ground to place the first and last board if it cuts into the ground, doing away with large gaps from the ground to the bridge.

, Level the ground with your feet or shovel before and after the bridge on each side and get a good flat entrance and exit.

, Walk over it, paint it, seal it, do whatever you want to with it. This bridge will last many years and should be very strong.

Use a bucket and scoop or dig trenches to drain away any excess water and mud.,
Use a mitre box or pipe cutter to cut away the affected pipe and/or fittings, making sure that the cuts are square with the pipe.

,
File away any rough edges on the end of the pipe where it was cut.

,
Place all of the component pieces together, without solvent or cement, to make sure they will fit together properly.

,
Apply primer to both the pipe and the fitting socket using an applicator that is at least half the diameter of the pipe.

,
Apply cement to the pipe end using the same applicator or another one of the same size.

,
Add a light application of cement to the fitting socket.

,
Apply a second coat of cement to the pipe.

,
Twist the pipe and the fitting socket together to connect them.

Fill and cover the repair area.

",How to Repair a Leaking Irrigation System," Wipe the area clean with rags. Keep the area as free of water, dirt, and mud as possible during the repair.;
,,,,,,,,, The minimum amount of time you should allow before testing the joint is 1-1/2 hours.

,,"
"
Isolate where the leak is.,
Dig a reasonable work space around and under the break, as you will want a bit of ""play"" or movement in the PVC in order to achieve a rock-solid tight fit with your repair.,
Using purple primer and the brush that comes with it, prime the outside of both of the remaining sprinkler pipe ends by painting a 1–2 inch (2.5–5.1 cm) wide strip around the outside of each pipe end starting at the lip/edge.,
Cut a piece of repair pipe to fit the length of the cut you made in the sprinkler line, minus approximately 1/2"" or more for each straight coupler used (the coupler adds approximately 1/2 inch to the length of the finished pipe).,
Fit the cut piece into the couplers dry, to be sure that the fit is correct and that the resulting pipe is not bowed,from the replacement piece being too long.

,
Disassemble and make any necessary adjustments, until the resulting fit is perfect.

,
Prime both ends of your cut piece, wait 5 seconds, then apply a light layer of glue to one end of the replacement piece and inside one of the straight couplers.,
Alternatively, use a ""repair"" coupling which does not have the inside center ridge; basically an over-sized section of pipe.,
Alternatively, you can cut a coupling piece in half, lengthwise.,
Watch the area of your repair for a few minutes before you cover your hole back up.

",How to Repair a Broken Sprinkler Line," This might require a little bit of digging, often where the water is coming out of the ground is not always the source of the leak. Once you have isolated the leak, turn off the water to that line, or area. Make sure you buy the correct diameter repair pipe and couplers. PVC pipe often has information about size and test-strength printed up and down the sides.;
, Clean out as much water, mud and dirt as possible. Approximately 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) on each side of the break, cut the pipe with a PVC cutter and be sure to wipe both ends clean of any mud (outside and inside). Paper towel can be stuffed into the end of the pipe to prevent dirt/mud from re-entering. If the pipe cracks when trying to cut it, place a small amount of PVC primer to the spot where the blade touches the pipe and let it sit for a couple of seconds before applying pressure to the cutter. This will soften the pipe and make it easier to cut without cracking. Remove the broken pipe but save for future subsequent steps.

, Prime the inside of 2 straight couplers. Attach a coupler to each pipe end by applying a coat of glue on outside of the pipe end and also to the inside of a coupler. Working quickly, firmly slide the coupler onto the pipe edge using a twisting motion, pushing hard until the pipe hits the lip inside the center of the coupler. Hold the coupler in place with pressure for 15-20 seconds. The clear glue dries in approximately 10 seconds and the blue glue in approximately 20 seconds so you must work quickly. Repeat for the other pipe end.

, To determine the length of the repair pipe, measure from the middle of one straight coupler to the other using a tape measure. If you don't have a tape measure, lay a piece of pipe down into the trench and measure it by eye, marking with a pen or pencil for your cut.

,,, Twist pipe hard into coupler until you feel it stop. Wait at least a full minute for that to dry then apply glue to the remaining pipe-end and coupler. With your final fitting, you may have to pull hard on the sprinkler-line pipe, either to the side or up, in order to get the replacement pipe to slip into the coupler. Don't worry, PVC is strong. Allow all fittings and joints to dry completely (3-5 minutes) before turning water back on in that line.

, With a repair coupling you can slide it all the way on the new pipe section, prime & glue the other pipe, and slide the repair coupling onto the old pipe.

, Grind down the inside center edge if it's a standard coupling. Then prime and glue one or both halves, depending on length of crack, and prime and glue the old pipe around the crack, and apply the half-piece(s) over the crack. Seals the crack and it's faster than cutting out the cracked section of pipe, especially if the cracked pipe is adjacent to another pipe or if it's simply hard to dig out enough.

Shut off the water supply.,
Attach a compressor to the mainline.,
Activate the furthest station.,
Close the backflow isolation valves and open the compressor valve.,
Activate the remaining stations.,
Shut off the compressor.,
Remove excess water from the system.",How to Winterize a Sprinkler System1," Turn the water supply off at the main water valve to prevent more water from entering the system. After completing this step, all you need to do is drain the water already inside the system.


The shut off valve for your sprinkler system should be located in an area that is unable to freeze over. Usually, it will be located inside the home, in a basement, garage, or utility closet.
In some cases, a stop and waste valve will be located underground. It can be as deep as 5 feet (1.5 m) down, so you may need a long key to turn it.;
, Hook up a small compressor to the mainline with a quick coupler, hose bib, or other type of connection, as determined by the connection located after the backflow device.


You will need a compressor with a CFM (cubic foot per minute) rating of 80 to 100 for any mainline with a diameter of 2 inches (5 cm) or less.Rent the equipment at an equipment rental yard.
Note that a small shop compressor will not have enough air to do the job right.
If you have the original layout for your sprinkler system and it shows the GPM (gallons per minute) running through each sprinkler head, divide the total GPM of each section or zone by 7.5. This calculation will give you the exact CFM you need to blow the system out.Do not fully charge the holding tank before releasing the pressurized air into the compensator as a way of compensating for less CFM. Only perform this method if you find a compressor with the right amount of CFM.
Make sure that the compressor valve is in the closed position as you attach the hose to the fitting. Both valves on the backflow preventer should be closed, as well.
Do not blow compressed air through the backflow device.
Take extra precaution when using highly compressed air. Compressed air can lead to injury and damage, especially if used improperly.

, This station should be on the controller that is in the zone furthest away from the compressor, or the sprinklers at the highest elevation away from the compressor.

, Once the backflow valves are closed, slowly open the valve on the compressor to slowly allow air to fill the sprinkler system.


The blow out pressure should always remain below the maximum operating pressure of the lowest pressure rated component in your system. It should also never exceed 80 PSI for PVC pipe systems, or 50 psi for flexible black polyethylene pipe systems.

, Work your way along the system, slowly activating each station or zone. Activate the stations furthest from the compressor first before working your way to the closest station.


You should activate each station until no additional water can be seen draining from the sprinkler heads. This can take about two minutes, if not longer, per station.
Consider using two or three short cycles per station rather than one long cycle. If it seems to take longer than two minutes to drain the water for each station, you may need to deactivate the stations early and repeat the procedure two or three times.
As soon as a station is dry, you should stop blowing air through the pipe. Blowing compressed air through a dry pipe can create friction and heat, which could damage the pipe.
Never run the compressor without having at least one station valve open.
You should only run air through one zone or section at a time. If you attempt to do more than that, the excess velocity of the air can add friction and heat to the pipe and fittings, which could cause them to melt.

, As soon as the systems have all been dried, disconnect the compressor from the system. Delaying can cause damage to your pipes.


Open the valves on the system to release any excess air pressure.

, If the sprinkler system has a backflow device with ball valves, open and close the isolation valves on the device a few times to force any trapped water to escape.


Leave these isolation valves open at a 45 degree angle and open the test cocks on the system.

Continue to learn as much as possible about the depletion of the world's fossil fuels.,
Lobby your local representatives for helping and funding research and development of alternative fuels.",How to Factor Falling Fuel Prices Into Your Household Activities," All the things that you do when fuel prices skyrocket should continue as your regular habit. This is good for your budget, good for your health, and good for the environment. Most of all, it means you are continuing to shape the habit of less reliance on fuel. So, keep:
Leaving the car at home unless you really need to use it



 


Walking to the local stores, clubs, sports activities etc. that are within walking distance






Preferring public transportation over your own car use






Cycling to and from work, school, studies, activities





;
, You will know how much extra your fuel cost you during a rise in prices. Try to put that difference into the bank account. Of course, if you were barely making ends meet during a price rise, you will need to focus on bill payments and grocery shopping but try to put aside any savings possible. This will become a form of future-proofing against the next round of fuel price rises.

, Keep on the plan to reduce the amount of cars in your household and trading gas-guzzlers for smaller models, or even for a hybrid. Think long-term rather than about the short-term benefits of a dip in fuel prices.

, This will be the ultimate price-driver as new fuels are barely in testing mode and are totally inadequate at this stage to take the place of oil derived fuels.

, A dip in prices can mean a boost in research money for the future. Encourage friends, family, neighbors and communities to demand wider availability and usage of alternative fuels. It is important not to become complacent and feel seduced by lower fuel prices - we need to be planning now to improve the viability of alternative fuels.

Clean the bottle thoroughly with water, and remove the label.
, Remove the cap and set it down on a piece of scrap wood. Use a drill or a nail and hammer to poke several holes into it. The more holes you poke, the faster the water will flow out. Place the cap back onto the bottle when you are done.Avoid making the holes too small, or they may get clogged up by the soil., You can do this with a serrated knife or a pair of sharp scissors. Plan on cutting the bottom inch (2.54 centimeters) off of the bottle.If your soda bottle has a molded line around the bottom, you can use that as a guide instead.

, It needs to be deep enough so that you can fit your bottle halfway into it.Plan on making the hole about 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters) away from the plant's stem. If you are digging next to an established plant, be careful not to cut through the roots., If you have not already, screw the cap back onto the bottle. Flip the bottle upside down, and insert it cap-side-down into the hole. Gently pat the soil down around the bottle.


You can insert the bottle deeper into the soil, but you will need at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) sticking out of the soil. This will prevent soil from getting into the water., Leave your drip irrigation to do its work. Make as many drip irrigation as you need for all of your plants.

Each area and water purveyor may have its own requirements, and some require a licensed irrigator and/or backflow tester to be present during the installation. These precautions ensure a safe installation that will prevent contamination from your irrigation system into drinking water.

If you plan on using the drip irrigation as a temporary system while your landscaping gets established, mention the expected time frame. The requirements may be lighter.
In many areas, including some U.S. states, proceeding without the proper permits or supervision can lead to fines, a court appearance, or even jail time.;
, Before you purchase your supplies, you'll need to know what exactly you need. Sketch a rough map of your garden, or the area you wish to drip irrigate. Divide the map into several regions based on one or more of the following:









Watering needs of each plant. Mark these heavy, medium, or light.
Levels of sun or shade. If most of your plants have similar watering needs, use sun exposure to divide your garden. Plants in full sun will need more water than plants in partial or full shade.
Soil types: Take this into account if your garden has major soil variation. See below for more information.

, A typical drip tube can reach a maximum length of 200 ft (60 m), or 400 ft (120 m) if the water enters the line at its center.If you need more than one drip tube, you can install a lateral line with two or more drip tubes extending from it at different points. For large gardens, use a pressurized mainline instead of the lateral line, and consider looping it in a full circle, which allows you to double its length to 800 feet (240 m) (240 m). Sketch the proposed layout onto your map.









Ideally, each drip tube should serve an area with similar watering needs.
""Distribution tubing"" is a smaller alternative to drip tubing. This can only reach a maximum length of 30 ft (9 m). Use only for potted or hanging plants to prevent clogging.Typically, the mainline runs along one length of the garden, or around the entire perimeter for large properties.

, Your drip emitters and tube diameter will determine the system's maximum GPH (gallons per hour). In order to meet your entire garden's water needs, you may need to divide your system into several zones. By installing a ""zone control valve"" in each zone, you can direct flow to one or two zones at a time.It's best to install each valve near the center of the zone, so it pushes water out at even pressure in all directions.

If the drip system will be permanent, it's worth the cost of an electric valve that hooks up to an irrigation controller. Manual valves are tedious to operate and often mistakenly left operating for longer than intended.
The equipment you buy should come with recommended maximum tube length and GPH. You can also calculate this yourself using hydraulic flow calculations.

, There are several ways to deliver water from the drip tubing to the plant. Determine which to use for each area in your garden:









Drip emitter: The most common option, this is a smaller diameter line attached to the main tubing. Punch holes using a drip irrigation hole punch anywhere along its length, so the water flows toward the plants. See below for information on types of drip emitters.

Pre-installed emitter lines: This drip tubing has evenly spaced emitters, suitable for crops, orchards, and vegetable rows. It also works for shrub beds and other densely planted sites, and even under turf if installed correctly.

Micro-sprinkler heads: Halfway between drip irrigation and sprinklers, these low-pressure sprinklers are less efficient but harder to clog, which may be useful in hard water areas.They work well in shaded area and for plants that prefer misting.

Porous pipe: This cheap alternative to drip tubing drips along its entire length, with no way to maintain water pressure or control rate. This is not recommended, as it clogs easily and may have a shorter maximum length. Never mix it with other types of emitters.

, If you decided to go with drip emitters, there are many types to choose from. Basic turbulent-flow emitters are a good default, but consider the following options in special circumstances:









Note: regardless of the time of emitter you choose, it should be self-flushing so it stays clear when the zone is shut off.
Use pressure-compensating (PC) drip emitters for changes in elevation over 5 ft (1.5 m). The ""PC"" label is unregulated, so look up product information and confirm it works with your desired flow rate before buying.
Adjustable drip emitters can be water wasting and prone to flooding plants if not checked often. If your plants have varying water needs, it's usually better to install several standard, color-coded emitters at different strengths (such as 1, 2, and 3 GPH).
Turbulent-flow emitters are a good, cheap option for all other purposes. Vortex, diaphragm, and long-path emitters will all work fine. These variations are less important than the differences described above.


, Now's the time to figure out how many emitters you need. Each emitter has a certain flow rate, usually expressed in GPH (gallons per hour). Here are some general guidelines based on soil type:








Sandy soil: This soil falls apart into grains when rubbed between your fingers. Space 1 to 2 GPH (3.8 to 7.6 liters per hour) emitters about 11"" (28 cm) apart.
Loamy soil: Quality soil, not too dense or loose. Space 0.5 to 1 GPH (1.9 to 3.8 LPH) emitters about 17"" (43 cm) apart.
Clay soil: Dense clay, slow to absorb water. Space 0.5 GPH (1.9 Lph) emitters about 20"" (51 cm) apart.
If using micro-sprinklers, space them 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) further apart than described above.
For trees or other plants with higher water needs, install two emitters spaced evenly around the root zone. Don't mix and match emitters with different flow rates on the same drip line.

, Besides the pipes and emitters, you'll need a plastic fitting for each connection, plus an end cap or flush valve for each drip tube. In addition, you'll need an ""air vent"" on the lateral line. This pops open when the zone shuts off to help flush the emitters. Read the instructions in the next section for additional equipment necessary to connect the system to a water source.









Compare all sizes and threads before purchasing. You'll need adapters to connect pipes of different size, or to attach ""hose thread"" to ""pipe thread.""
If using a lateral line, use black polyethylene tubing. (PVC irrigation piping is only rated for below-ground use.)
If using a mainline, choose piping made from copper, galvanized steel, PEX, sturdy PVC, or heavy polyethylene. Bury PVC to protect it from sunlight.The size and type of your pipe determines the maximum flow rate. For most homes, ¾"" Class 200 PVC pipe is large enough, supporting a flow of 10 gallons per minute.If your water supply has a higher flow rate than that, increase the size of your pipes and zone valves accordingly.

, Every irrigation mainline must be its own closed system, with backflow assemblies preventing any contamination back into the drinking water supply. Your backflow assembly must stop all backflow from both back pressure and back-siphonage, and comply with all laws and local code.








, If you want to water your garden automatically, install an irrigation controller to a convenient location. Wire this to each zone control valve using direct burial irrigation wire (type AWG-UF) and waterproofed wire splices. Sheathe any above ground wires in conduit.







, Drip tubing is easily clogged by rust, minerals, and other particles in the water. Use a mesh sized 155 (100 microns) or higher, and rated for twice your expected water pressure.







, Also called a pressure reducing valve, this reduces and regulates water pressure in your irrigation lines. Install this if your system has a water pressure above 40 psi (2.8 bars).







, If more than one drip line will run from this line, install your PVC lateral line first. Each drip line in the area will run from this pipe.









Don't forget to protect your lateral line from sunlight using aluminum tape.

, Use a tubing cutter to cut the drip tubing to desired lengths. Push each drip tube into a connector and attach the connector to your pressure regulator or lateral line. Lay out the drip lines on the surface of the garden.









Do not bury your drip lines, or they may end up chewed by rodents. Cover them with mulch if you wish to hide them — after you finish installation.
Add control valves before each drip line if you want to be able to adjust or shut them off individually.

, Secure the drip lines using ordinary garden stakes.








, If you are using drip emitters or micro-sprinklers, attach these along your drip lines. Use a small punch tool to pierce the drip tube, then insert the emitter tightly.









Do not use a nail or other improvised object, which may create a leaky, ragged hole., Attach a flush valve or end cap to each drip tube to prevent water leaking out the end. While you could just bend the tube back and crimp it shut, these tools make it easy to inspect and clean clogged tubing.








, Set the timer on manual and turn on the water supply. Adjust the control valves until the emitters release a slow, steady trickle of water. Once finished, set the timer according to your garden's needs. Check the whole system for leaks and repair if needed:









For metal to metal connections, either wrap the threads with Teflon tape no more than three times, or apply a small amount of pipe thread paste (""pipe dope""). Using too much tape or pipe dope can make leaks worse, especially with soft metals such as brass or copper.
Plastic threaded connections seal better than metal and are not designed to work with Teflon tape or pipe dope. Tighten them as far as you can by hand, then use a hand tool to tighten no more than one full turn.

The shut off valve for your sprinkler system should be located in an area that will not be able to freeze over. Oftentimes, the valve will be located inside, in a basement, garage, or utility closet.
In some cases, a stop and waste valve will be located underground. It can be as deep as 5 feet (1.5 m) down, so you may need a long key to turn it.

, These valves should be located at the end points and low points of your sprinkler system's piping. After opening the valves, the water in the mainline of the system should drain out on its own.

, After the mainline finishes draining, open either the boiler drain valve or the drain cap on the stop and waste valve. Open all the test cocks on the backflow device, as well.


Your system will either have a boiler drain valve or a drain cap on a stop and waste valve. It will not have both. The option it does have will vary depending on which option is used in your area, so you can check with neighbors or a local professional to find out which you can expect to find.

, If the sprinklers in your system have check valves, you will need to pull up on the sprinklers so that the water can drain out of the bottom of the sprinkler head.


Most sprinklers will have check valves. If yours does not, however, you will need to hope that the water can completely drain out of the other valves along the system instead.

, Turn one of the systems or sprinkler heads along the mainline. This will relieve the pressure within the system, thereby preventing any pipes from bursting or cracking.


Note that this method is used when automatic drain valves are located at the end points and low points of your system's piping. These valves automatically open and drain water once pressure in the piping is less than 10 PSI. As such, you need to prompt the pressure to drop before the valves will open, which is another reason for activating one of the systems along the mainline.

Get a plastic bottle.,
Poke holes in the sides of the bottle.,
Poke holes in the bottom of the bottle.,
Dig a hole into the soil next to the plant.,
Insert the bottle into the soil.,
Fill the bottle with water.",How to Make a Drip Irrigator from a Plastic Bottle2," A 2-liter soda bottle will work the best, but if you are only watering a small plant, you may be able to use a smaller one. Clean the bottle thoroughly inside-out with water and remove the label., Focus on making the holes in the bottom two-thirds of the bottle. You can make as many or as few holes as you want; the more you make, the faster the water will flow. If you are only going to be watering one plant, place the holes on the same side of the bottle.Make the holes using a nail or a metal skewer.
You may have to heat the nail or skewer up over a flame first.

, This is very important as it will allow the water from collecting in the bottom and growing stagnant. If your bottle has a segmented bottom (ie: most 2-liter soda bottles), you will need to poke a hole in each segment.The bottom of most bottles is typically made from thicker plastic. You will need to use a drill or a hot nail to do this.

, The hole needs to be deep enough to insert the bottle about two-thirds of the way, or where the straight walls start to curve into a dome., If you places the holes on one side of the bottle, rotate the bottle until the holes face the plant. Gently pat the soil around the bottle., Remove the cap first, then use a hose to fill the bottle with water; you can also insert a funnel into the neck to make filling easier. Leave the cap off, otherwise the water won't flow out.

If the water is flowing out too fast, you can put the cap on loosely. The tighter you close it, the slower the water will flow out.You can also cut the top, domed portion of the bottle off, invert it, and use it like a funnel.

Thread wire or sturdy string through each of the holes.,
Set the irrigator up an fill the bottle with water.,
Open the knob and make any adjustments, if needed.",How to Make a Drip Irrigator from a Plastic Bottle3," The hole needs to be big enough to fit the rubber gasket and the flexible aquarium tubing. You can create the hole using a drill and drill bit or with a nail.The hole needs to be about 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) up from the bottom of the bottle.
If you are using a nail, heat it up over a flame first, then make the hole. Widen the hole with a craft blade.

, The tubing needs to be only 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) long. You will be using this to attach the aquarium fitting to the bottle., The gasket needs to be big enough to fit into the hole, but small enough to fit around the tubing. If the gasket is too big for the tubing, you can cut a segment out of it to make it smaller, then wrap it around the tubing., Push the assembled gasket and tubing into the hole. Next, push the tubing into the hole that that about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of it is inside the bottle. The rest of the tubing should be sticking out of the bottle., Purchase a small tube of sealant meant for fixing aquariums, or other leaks. Pipe a thin band around the joint between the gasket and the bottle. If you need to, use a popsicle stick or a toothpick to smooth the sealant down. Allow the sealant to cure.You may need to seal the area between the gasket and the tubing itself.

, You can purchase aquarium fittings in aquarium supply stores and online. They look a little like a faucet, with an opening on each end, and a knob on top. One of the opens is usually pointed. You want to insert the non-pointed opening into the tubing., You don't really have to do this, but it will make filling the bottle easier. You can also cut it off only partway so that it's still attached to the rest of the bottle by a ""hinge."" This will allow you to partially close the opening., Use a hole puncher to punch 3 to 4 holes along the top, cut edge of the bottle. Make the holes straight across from each other so that they form a triangle (for three holes) or a square (for four holes).If you want to stand the irrigator on a table above your plant, fill the bottom inch (2.54 centimeters) or so with pebbles. This will help keep it stable., Cut 3 to 4 long pieces of thin wire or strong string. Thread and tie each string to a punched hole. Gather all of the strings together, then tie them into a knot at the other end.Skip this step if you are standing the irrigator up.

, Hang the irrigator from a hook above your plant. Close the knob on the aquarium fitting first so that no water leaks out. Fill the bottle with water.

You can also stand the irrigator on a table or wall above your plant instead.

, If the water won't reach the plant because something is in the way, cut another piece of aquarium tubing. Secure one end to the pointed tip of the aquarium fitting, and set the other end on top of the soil, right next to the plant.The more you unscrew the knot, the faster the water will flow.
The tighter you screw the knob, the slower the water will flow.

, (Just don't go out driving around wasting gas, remember that you want to keep this at zero dollars.) Look in the big open dumpsters for the 5 gallon (18.9 L) pails that drywallers and painters throw out.

, The plastic will become very clean and the old paint sometimes just peels away. Toss the refuse you've removed from the pails into a plastic bag and put that out with the normal trash.

, Use dish pans in your sink so that you can pour the water directly into the 5 gallon (18.9 L) pail(s). If the dishpan is hard to find, check the thrift stores or purchase one from home goods stores everywhere. Yes, there is a small expense in obtaining this but it will last for years. In the end, you will see a profit and not an expense! Repeat the washing and pouring process many times.
, Use the water straight from the pails that you have been filling.

, You can also scoop out the bathwater if you have baths now and then and even have shower water go into the pail. As well as saving costs on irrigation, you are now also saving the planet by using less water, using fewer harsh chemicals (automatic dish-washing detergents are very expensive and harmful to septic and sewer systems) and electricity (related to that dishwasher), taking some pressure off the septic tank or the municipal sewer system, and getting some exercise to boot.

Decide what kind of irrigation system will meet your needs.",How to Install an Irrigation System1," The types most often used in the home setting are drip, popup bubblers and popup sprayers. While each type will irrigate, each performs better in specific situations. You must decide whether one type or a combination will do the trick for you.


A drip irrigation system is exactly what it says and involves low water pressure and no aerial spray to achieve the goal of correctly watering your plants. It is made of perforated water hose or pipe laid on, or just below, the surface and runs to a controller. This system works best for flower or garden beds.
The bubbler irrigation system relies on moderate pressure that causes a popup head that, rather than spray, allows the water to ""bubble"" out and soak slowly into the ground. This arrangement is attached to small water lines that run from a controller, or valve, activated as needed. It is intended for deep watering. Bubblers are used for, and around, shrubbery or trees.
Popup sprayers pop up and deliver a pressurized aerial spray that uses a zone system to irrigate flower and garden beds as well as lawns. Popup sprayers are often the reason water runs off into streets and drainage systems. This is all due to over watering and their ability to put out more water than the ground can soak up.;

Flush a clogged emitter.,
Open the emitter and manually clean it if necessary.,Turn your drip system on and off several times to send water to the emitters and push debris through.,
Check your system's filters for clogging.,
Add household bleach to the water-filled drip lines.",How to Clean a Clogged Drip System,"

Turn on your drip irrigation system.
Hold your finger over the clogged emitter's outlet for a few seconds and let the water flush back to clean the emitter.;
, Check if your irrigation model requires this.,, Some filters catch sand and could need frequent cleaning. Try backwashing the filters with the drip system's own water or manually remove and clean them., The bleach's chlorine can reduce calcium carbonate buildup from hard water running through the lines.

Introduce the bleach during the final 30 minutes of an irrigation cycle or however long it takes to fill all the drip lines with water.
Enough bleach should be added so that by the time the irrigation cycle ends, the residual chlorine at the end of the system would be the same amount as found in 2.6 oz. (78 ml) of bleach mixed in 1000 gallons (4000 l) of water.
Use a metering pump to add a food-grade phosphoric acid to the drip lines to keep their water's pH at 7. Injecting acid for a short period of time, then rinsing it through the lines, should not harm the drip system.

",How to Fix a Broken Sprinkler Pipe," Nothing is worse than having to run to the hardware store in the middle of a project. See the list of things you need below.;
, Usually a soggy area of grass, but sometimes it is a geyser.

,, Not the whole pipe, just the section that is broken. Carefully remove the section of grass above the pipe, trying to keep it intact. Do this by cutting a circular section with the end of your shovel above where you are to dig then carefully lifting it off. Dig up the dirt above the bad pipe with a shovel (you will probably also need a hand trowel to dig up the dirt under the pipe). You will want to have at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) on each side of the break clear and enough room for you fist underneath the pipe. If the hole fills with water, you will either have to wait for it to dry or bail it out (the latter is recommended).

, Get a hacksaw, PVC or metal pipe cutters (depending on what type of pipe you have, older sprinkler systems are usually metal, while newer ones tend to be PVC). Cut the broken section out so that you have clean, undamaged pipe on both sides.

, It should probably be 1/2 "" to 1"" shorter to allow room for the connectors. Or you can buy a PVC fitting from most home improvement stores that has one pipe sliding inside an outer barrel with an O-ring inside. It will extend almost 3"" in length. I have seen in stores 1/2"" to 2 1/2"" in diameter sizes. One end is a female slip and the other is a male that needs a coupling, elbow, or tee to connect to complete the repair.

, Some water will come pouring out at first, you could try to catch it, but it is easier to bail it out. Once the water stops coming out, clean both ends with a rag.

, If you are lucky enough to have PVC then you just put the PVC primer and glue on the outside of the pipe and inside of the straight connectors and slip them together. Work quickly because the glue sets fast. Then put the section you just glued in the gap you just created, repeating the gluing procedure. If you have metal pipes you will have to thread the outside of the pipe to fit the connectors rather than gluing them.

, Turn the sprinklers back on and make sure it is sealed properly.

Tie into a water source, and then run your lines and sprinkler heads as you need from that point out.,
Inspect your landscape for the best locations for your system and sprinkler heads.,
Backfill your trench and pressure test your system by slowly turning on the water.,
Adjust the heads for maximum coverage, and look for water seeping up from loose joints.",How to Install an Irrigation System2,"


The water source can be as simple as an outside water hydrant that you can attach a hose to. You will need to find the source of your water for your garden for more complicated tie-ins.

, Lay out the system using water-based spray paint.


The lines will be either just below the surface or laid on top of the ground if you are installing a drip or soaker irrigation system. This will require minimal excavation or trenching for the supply lines. It only involves laying or unrolling a small diameter line on top of flower or garden beds. Secure the line to the ground using a stake, which is easily available from an irrigation supply house.
Popup bubblers or aerial sprinkler systems will require trenching for the supply line locations of sprinkler heads.
Begin installation of the lines using PVC pipe and fittings (tees) at the locations of the sprinkler heads. Use glue and sleeves to make the connections. Cut the lines to the correct length using a PVC saw or snips.
You can begin installing your sprinkler heads and cutting the extension from the tees once the irrigation lines and tees with extensions have been installed. Use PVC glue for this.

, Increase the pressure on the line slowly as you go. Your sprinkler heads should be working at this time.

, Uncover and repair the line if you see water seeping up from the ground.

Decide whether the cost and labor of a temporary system is cost effective in your situation.,
Decide how and where you can connect to a water source.,
Lay out the area you will be watering to determine the number of individual sprinkler heads you will need, and the amount of pipe and other materials required.

,
Choose the type of sprinkler heads you will use, then use the manufacturer's literature to determine the spacing and water requirements for each head.,
Connect to your water source, using utility approved devices to control backflow and to meter water usage if required.,
Run mains, the larger pipes that provide water to branch lines and individual zones (if you need to break the system down or branch it for efficient watering) along edges of sidewalks or buildings.,
Install adapter tees where you will install your sprinkler heads, spacing them according to the design or manufacturer's coverage literature.,
After installing the piping system and sprinkler head adapter tees, flush all the pipes with water to remove trash that would otherwise stop up the sprinkler heads when they are installed.,
Check the system for obvious leaks while the system flushes.,
Install the heads to the adapter tees using suitable connectors.,
Preset the rotation (of rotating heads) to cover the amount of radius needed to cover the area you are watering, and to avoid spraying adjacent buildings or pavements where the water is at least wasted, if not damaging.

,
Turn on the water, doing so slowly to avoid water hammer or other shock to the equipment.,
Readjust any heads that are not covering their full area, and look for dry spots that often occur where the radius of two heads meet.,
Keep in mind that since this is a temporary system, the materials, including the valves, pipes, and heads will be on top of the soil or grass.",How to Install a Temporary Irrigation System," Even a minimal system can be expensive, and you may need to add the cost of the water if you are connected to a public utility or other water provider.;
, Drilling a well may be an option, but the additional cost can be prohibitive. Connecting to fire hydrants may be possible if the utility the hydrant belongs to permits use for this purpose, but you will likely be required to use a backflow preventer and water meter, and to disconnect the system when you are not on site.

,, Many home centers offer computer assisted design (CAD) services free of charge if you buy the materials from them.

, Make sure you can valve off your sprinkler lines to control water flow after the system is installed. You can use standard ball or gate valves for this purpose, or invest in electrically operated irrigation valves if you choose to install a timer or controller in your system.

, This ensures that their presence doesn't impede mowing, traffic, or other activities that will take place in the irrigated area.

, An example would be a gear driven Rain Bird R-5000 head which can cover a 32 foot (9.7 meters) radius using 3 gallons (11 liters) of water per minute at 22 pounds per square inch pressure.

, Allow enough water to run through the system to clean sand or other heavy material from within the pipes. For long runs with multiple heads, you may have to begin installing the heads closest to the water source to create enough pressure and velocity to flush the lines further down the run.

, Temporary irrigation such as those used by contractors often reuse components, including pipe and fittings, and these may be damaged during handling and while in storage. Even new pipe may have invisible damage that will appear when the system is operating, and repairing leaks before the heads are installed will prevent the need to re-flush it later.

, Make sure they are stable, and stake each head if necessary to prevent them from becoming loose or breaking off during use. Use nylon zip ties to anchor the heads to the stakes.

,, Watch the heads as they prime up and begin to operate, to make sure they are functioning as anticipated.

, Allow the system to run long enough to determine the amount of water you are applying is sufficient. You can place buckets or cans to collect water for a specified period of time, then measure to calculate how much is being applied, often measured in fractions of inches or inches (or millimeters).

, This means that they are exposed to hazards, so make it a routine to inspect the system regularly, preferably before each watering cycle, as busted pipes can cause flooding or erosion problems, as well as wasting water.

Check your local codes by calling local officials or searching online.;
, Septic tanks, muddy areas, sewers or animal pens can all potentially contaminate wells. Waste matter leeches through the soil, all the way down to the water reservoir: anyone who drinks water from a well drilled near these areas could get sick. Drill at least 50 feet away from any of these areas., If you live in a populated area, you will want to check with your local utility companies before you drill. Many electricity, gas and telephone companies run conduits underground, so any drilling could interfere with or strike their lines. Call your utility providers to find the location of any cabling running under your property.

, Different factors on your property will give you information about how much water to expect to get from underwater reservoirs. Soil type, topography, information about your water table and vegetation can give clues about where to dig.Areas with heavy sand and gravel deposits often yield water. The larger the pieces of gravel or sand, the more water is most likely beneath the surface. These areas will be harder to drill, however, because of large boulders that may exist in the path of your drill.
Vegetation can tell you the location of water. In arid climates, locations with greater number of plants growing indicate water below the surface. Look for groups of trees or shrubs to locate a good place to drill.
Topography can help you make your choice. Areas of lower elevation, such as the bottoms of valleys or hills often yield more water. You may also have success drilling near rivers or other bodies of water like ponds or streams.
It may also be helpful to call your county survey office or other planning organization and ask for groundwater maps. Many county offices can provide you with information about the location of water tables and places where others have successfully dug wells.

, The well screen is the most important part of the well: it attaches to the bottom of the long PVC well pipe and lets the water in, filtering out debris and sand. The well screen has hundreds of small slits that filter out the debris, keeping your water clean., There will be a 4 inch (10.2 cm) space between the bottom of the 8 inch (20.3 cm) PVC pipe where there are no slits. This 4 inches (10.2 cm) gap will connect to the the PVC pipe., Mark three slits circumferentially around the 8 inch (20.3 cm) pipe. The slits should be approximately 7 inches (17.8 cm) long and should be equally spaced apart. The gap between each slit should be approximately 1.4 inches (3.5 cm). Make sure your slit does not connect all the way around the pipe. Leave a small gap between the ends of each slit.

, Draw three more slits two inches above the first set of slits. Again, make sure that the slits don’t wrap all the way around the screen, but instead have a gap of two inches between ends of the slits.

, Keep drawing sets of three slits, all two inches apart. You can stop when the the screen reaches 6 feet (1.8 m) in length. The length of six feet will allow a great deal of water to come through the pipe and be filtered.

, Using a hacksaw, cut out the slits according to the lines you drew. Carefully saw each line, making sure not to cut all the way through the pipe. Continue sawing until you have made a slit for every line.

, You’ll need to find a PVC cap to the end of the well screen. Make sure that it fits the well screen snugly. Any leakage here, and your well will not filter properly., The primer will help hold the end cap onto the screen and prevent any leakages. Apply the primer liberally to avoid any leaks., Once you’ve applied the primer to the end cap, turn to the well screen. Apply the same amount of primer around the mating portion of the well screen. The double portion of primer will help both pieces to hold together.

, You’ll have to work quickly here, as the cement dries quickly. Paint over the exact area that you primed., Again, work quickly. Hold the end cap onto the screen for fifteen seconds to allow the cement to dry. Let the pipe rest for several minutes to ensure that the glue has dried completely.

, The foot valve is the mechanism that allows water to be drawn in but does not allow water to escape back out. There are two foot valves used in this well. The first one is at the bottom of the six inch PVC pipe and the second one is at the bottom of the 4 inch (10.2 cm) PVC. These mechanisms will allow the water to be drawn into the 6 inch (15.2 cm) pipe on the upstroke of the well, and it well push water through the 4 inch (10.2 cm) pipe on the down stroke, when water is pushed out of the well., There are several choices when it comes to boring your well. You can use a hand auger, a well point, or a DIY drill. Each method involves different equipment, but all will require a lot of physical labor. Note that these methods will only work well in soil, soft gravel or other softer land types. Rocky terrain or soil with a high clay content may require a professional drilling rig.Reach your required depth. Using your chosen method, work until you reach the depth you want for your well. If you want to check to see if you’ve reached water, tie a small rock to a string and feed the string down the hole. When you feel the rock reach the bottom of the pipe, pull it back up. If the string is wet, you’ve reached the water line.

, For the hand auger method, you will need an extendable auger and a lot of patience. Depending on how deep you want your well, you may need many extendable attachments for the auger.Turn the auger in a clockwise direction into the ground. This will move the earth and create the beginning of your hole. Continue to turn the auger to displace the earth.
Remove the auger when full. Once the auger is filled with dirt, you will need to empty it. Pull the auger out of the hole and dispose of the earth. Start a pile for your dirt and continue to empty the dirt into this pile for easier cleanup.
Continue to bore into the ground. Continue drilling deeper, always moving clockwise. Empty the dirt into the same pile and work the auger until it you can’t reach any further.
Extend the auger when it becomes too short. Add a drill rod to the auger when it can no longer reach the bottom of the bored hole. It may become difficult to detach the auger once you’ve added many extensions: to overcome this, use a spanner to catch the auger while you install or remove the auger in pieces.
Drill until you reach your desired depth. Depending on how deep you want your well to be, continue to add extensions to your auger as you drill to that depth. Once you’ve reached the bottom of the well, stop drilling and remove the last bit of dirt. You’re now ready to bail the well.

, This method can be easier than the auger method, and requires less specialized tools. You’ll need your PVC well pipe and a sharpened “well point” attached to the end of the well screen.Start a pilot hole. Using a post hole digger or shovel, dig a hole two feet deep. This will give you a good starting point. It will also give you a good idea of the softness of the soil, and let you know how hard it will be to dig.
Install your well point. Well points are generally made of steel or any other hard metal, so that they can withstand being driven deep into the ground. They are available for sale in a variety of sizes that will fit onto the end of your PVC pipe.Begin driving the well point. If the soil is soft enough, you can use a rubber mallet or other heavy hammer to strike the end of the PVC pipe section, driving the pipe into the ground. If the earth is harder, you can use wrenches to turn the pipe, screwing it as you would a screw into wood. Be careful not to apply too much force to the PVC with either a hammer or wrench: it can shatter.Add each extension of pipe. The end of the pipe that you are striking or screwing into the ground will continue to get closer and closer to the ground. As it becomes level with the earth, add the next length of pipe, screwing the joints together. Then continue driving the pipe into the hole.

, There are ways to construct your own drill that will make digging faster and better for permeating hard soil. However, these methods take some mechanical know-how and can be dangerous. They’re also more expensive than an auger or well point. Research methods online, or ask mechanically-handy friends.


Use a water drill. This type of drill works by forcing water into the ground. The high pressure of the water acts effectively as a drill bit, moving dirt out of the way. There are many resources online that can help you build a water drill, but the process is time and labor intensive.Use or modify a digging machine. If you have a tractor or other small farm machine, you can use or modify a post hole digger or mechanical auger to dig the hole. Be aware that these methods require a large financial investment if you don’t already own them. They may also only be able to dig a hole up to 10 feet deep, requiring modification that can be dangerous if you don’t know how to use the equipment., Bailing the well will remove dirty, non-potable water that has been sitting at the bottom of the well. A bailer is a thin, hollow rod on a string that you’ll lower down your PVC pipe. Once it reaches the water line, it will fill up with the dirty water. Draw it back up out of the well and dump out the water. Repeat until the water runs clean.

, The tripod acts as the pump for your well, so you’ll want it to sit directly over the hole in a stable position. Make sure that the feet are on even ground and that it doesn’t rock back and forth., If you used the well point method, your PVC pipe will already be in the ground. However, if you used the auger method or another drill, you’ll need to place the well screen over the outer foot valve pipe, then lower it into the ground.

, Again, if you used the auger method, you’ll need to lower the inner foot valve pipe into the outer foot valve pipe. It may be easiest to screw all of the pipes together before inserting them into the hole.

, The hand pump will create the pressure that draws water out of the earth, so you’ll want to make sure that it’s firmly connected to the PVC pipe. Screw it in all the way and attach the handle.

, Draw up some water from your new well to make sure it works. Before you drink or use any of the well water, you’ll want to have it tested to make sure there is no bacteria or other contaminants in the water. Many labs test water quality, so search in the phone book or online for a facility that can help you.

Cut through the lawn surrounding the sprinkler head, about 6 inches (15.2 cm) all the way around, using a serrated knife or dirt shovel with a point on the end.,
Pry up the section of turf using a hand trowel or small shovel (about 2-3 inches thick) and set the turf aside to replace later.

,
Carefully dig away the dirt surrounding the sprinkler head.,
Once you have cleared all the way down to the riser (a short vertical pipe connected to the water-supply pipe), unscrew the old sprinkler body and remove it.,
Take the old sprinkler body to the store, and buy a new sprinkler body that is the same size as the old one.,
Wrap a thin coating of Teflon tape around the threaded male end of the riser (Teflon tape is available in the plumbing section of any home-improvement store).,
Turn on the sprinkler line for just a moment to blow out any dirt that may have fallen into the line.

,
Turn off the sprinklers, then using the flush-plug ring, pull up the riser, unscrew the flush-plug, put in the plastic filter screen and screw on the nozzle.

,
Twist the nozzle to align the spray pattern so it sprays onto the lawn, not the surrounding area.,
Replace the dirt back into the hole, packing it down around the sprinkler body.

,
Replace the turf and push it down around the sprinkler head.

,
Turn on the sprinklers to check that everything is spraying correctly.",How to Repair a Pop up Sprinkler Head," (Be cautious not to dig too deep so as not to puncture the water line.) Please note that if you have a 6 inch (15.2 cm) pop-up or greater, there is a good chance that the piping has been run to the side inlet of your head (only a few inches underground). Pay special attention to avoid slicing the tubing to this side inlet.;
,, Set the dirt in a pile nearby; you'll need it later to refill the hole. Dig down carefully until you reach the water-supply pipe (about 6-8 inches below the grass).

, Be careful not to let too much dirt fall into the opening of the riser (plug it with a small piece of cloth). The riser may become unscrewed from the supply pipe while remaining attached to the sprinkler. Simply unscrew it from the sprinkler being careful not to damage the threads at either end. It is sometimes helpful to shove a sharp hunting knife into the end of the riser, and twist to remove the riser from the sprinkler. The edges of the knife dig just slightly into the riser, allowing you enough contact to twist and remove the riser.

, The foolproof way is to buy exactly the same brand and model as the old. If not, be sure that the new one matches the old in 2 ways: (1) same diameter female opening at the bottom, and (2) same overall length. Different brands are different lengths, and if you get one that is too long, it will stick out of the grass after you install it. Another consideration: if possible, buy a sprinkler body that has an orange flush-plug top instead of a nozzle, which will make it easy to flush dirt from the line after installation.

, Screw in the new sprinkler body until it is hand-tight.

,,,


Before re-filling the hole, run the sprinkler and check for leaks around the riser. Tighten the sprinkler as necessary (or add more Teflon tape) to eliminate the leak.

,,, You may need to twist the nozzle slightly to adjust the pattern

,
Turn the power back on and test your new pump.",How to Replace a Well Pump," Before embarking on any of the following, ensure you have determined the pump to be at issue, by properly troubleshooting and checking the other components in your well system first, based on the presenting symptoms. No water does not always equal no pump. When in doubt, always consult a professional. Be sure to follow any and all applicable laws and codes.;
,


Determine what type of pump you need. Submersible pumps are used in deeper wells and will be beneath the ground in a well casing, while a jet pump is used in shallow wells that are less than 25 feet (7.63 m) deep and will be above ground.
Find out the power ratings, the gallons (l) per minute pumped and the well size before you install a new pump.
Locate well pumps at a water supply retail store, hardware store or online. When replacing well pumps, be sure to purchase the correct type of pump.

, A circuit breaker controls the flow of electricity to your house, and the well should be on a separate switch. Pay attention to the voltage assigned to the breaker (110/120,240v) as you will need this information to troubleshoot your pump issues, and correctly set up your new pump.

, When you install a new pump, you need to drain the water from the pumping system.

,,,, When replacing well pumps, you need a good seal to prevent water leaks.

,


Screw the pipe from the well, or inlet pipe, to the inlet pipe on the jet pump with a plumber's wrench.
Screw the pipe that brings water to the house, or outlet pipe, to the outlet pipe on the jet pump with a plumber's wrench.

, Tighten the wires to the electrical terminal with a screwdriver. Check that the pump motor is wired for the same voltage as what is being supplied from the circuit breaker. If the voltage is not the same, rewire the pump motor to the appropriate voltage configuration per the manufacturer included instructions.

, Jet pumps need to be primed before use. Do this by filling the pump with water through the outlet pipe coming out of the top of the pump or an available access hole that may be located on the pump. Pour in water until the pump is full. Proceed to the next step. If pump loses prime, doesn't pump at a sufficient rate, or doesn't pump water after being primed and run, it may indicate other problems with the water system (i.e. bad check valve) or the well itself ( i.e. hole in drop pipe, plugged point/jet). A problem of this nature may have been the causation of the old pump failure and may not make itself readily apparent until this point.

,, Before starting you will need to have the following materials:


an assistant
high-powered flashlight (something on the white light spectrum)
two pipe wrenches
multimeter
wrench/socket set
knife
soft-set pipe dope (preferred) or Teflon tape
submersible pump wire splice kit
wiring pliers
wire nuts
electrical tape
propane torch
T-handle (parts to build listed further on)
2 pipe dogs/pipe clamps
short handled sledgehammer
petroleum jelly
3ft. of 2"" Sch.40 PVC
Torque arrestor (6-8"" wells)

, If the drop pipe and wire come up through the well cap, and is piped together above ground it is most probably a well seal or a Morrison head. If this is not the case, it is probably connected using some type of pitless adapter, or in rare instances direct piped through the side of the casing with a galvanized tee.


One last point of mention: this is not to be embarked upon lightly. While this article tries to be as informative as possible, and cover a variety of situations, there are inherent risks and circumstances beyond control that may lead to the loss of the pump and pipe down the well, and possible serious injury to persons involved in this activity. If you are uncomfortable with any of the aforementioned and aforementioned processes, please consult the appropriate professionals.

, The well cap is on the round piece of metal sticking out from the deep well, and will give you access to the submersible pump.


Take off the hex nuts that hold the cap in place with a socket wrench. 7/16"" is a common size for many caps. On some older caps it may use small hex bolts, mounted horizontally (same as the system used with 4"" metal vent caps).

If your jurisdiction requires vermin-proof well caps, and your cap is not, replace with a compliant well cap.


Lift the well cap off the well housing.
Pull up the extra wire and wire nuts. Inspect nuts for tightness and wire for damage. If a nut is loose in a way that the wires are no longer connected, or a wire is broken, rectify issue and test for pump function. If not resolved, or no issue found , proceed to undo the wires, paying attention to which wire connects to which. At this point, have oneself or the assistant turn the power back on to the well. If there's a control box, be sure to hit the reset button. After this, use the multimeter to test the wire supplying the well (not the pump wire). If there is not 240v (give or take a few volts) there, it indicates a problem on that end. Diagnose and rectify the problem, before reconnecting and retesting for pump function. If this is not the issue, proceed to the next step. Be sure power is off again.

, Use the high-powered flashlight to look inside the well casing.


In colder regions, where freezing is an issue, the pitless adapter is usually located 4-8 feet below the top of the well. In warmer regions, it may be located nearer to the surface.
The pitless is the brass fixture on top of the drop pipe. You should be able to see the threads where the T-handle threads into it. Depending on the type of adapter, these may be male or female threads.
There may be a pipe that extends from the top of the pitless, to the top of the well casing or slightly past, with a bar (for lack of a better description) that spans the top of the casing, or that has a coupling on the end with or without a plug in it. This is called a hold-down. It stops the pitless from unseating during pump operation. Sometimes, the hold-down is tack welded to the side of the well casing. This can be undone with a hammer blow, or a grinder if necessary. Undo the bar, plug, or tack weld, and thread a short T-handle to the end, after the next step.
Try to ascertain the size of the adapter (either 1” or 1-1/4”). If there is a hold down, the diameter of the hold-down pipe should be sufficient information provided it is at least 1”. This information is critical to the next step.
If you have a 7” well with a donut shaped pitless that fills the well casing, you have a Whitewater pitless. Due to the notorious difficulty involved in pulling and resetting this type of pitless, it is strongly advised that it is left to professional care.
If it appears like you may have just a tee, piped through the side of the casing, consult a professional.

, Using the information obtained in the previous step, construct a T-handle using galvanized steel pipe and fittings corresponding to the size of your adapter (1” or 1-1/4”). Do not substitute the specified material for PVC (not strong enough) or other metals (more expensive).


For a short T-handle use:

1 tee
3 pieces of pipe 12” long, or 6 6” nipples joined together with 3 couplings.
Construction is simple. One foot of pipe in each side of the tee. Tighten all joints completely. Do not cross-thread.


For a long T-handle:

1 tee
2 pieces of pipe 12” long, or 4 6” nipples joined together with two couplings.
1 long piece or no more than two pieces of pipe joined together with a coupling, of a length equal to at least the distance from the top of the pitless, to the top of the well casing, plus one foot. Longer is ok, shorter is not. Construct by putting the 12” pieces in the sides of the tee, with the longest section going in the bottom of the tee. Tighten all joints completely, do not cross thread.


Thread the T-handle into the pitless or the hold-down. If you are unable to determine whether your pitless is male or female threads, keep a coupling of the appropriate diameter handy. Attach to the end of T-handle and attempt to thread, if male threads don't connect. If you are unable to determine the diameter of your adapter, build a 1"" T-handle, keep an 1-1/4-1 reducer and a short nipple handy. Try those combinations needed. If your T-handle connects but fails to thread, stop and consult a professional. The threads in the pitless may be damaged or fouled and an insufficient connection will lead to the loss of the pump and pipe. If you have made a successful connection, hand tighten as tight as you can, and give two more turns with a pipe wrench to complete. Do not cross-thread. Proceed to the next step.

, A winch or derrick has the strength to pull the submersible pump out without damaging the casing or yourself. The method for pulling the pump that will be described here is a variant of the ""double dog"" method, and while not the standard method of pulling well pumps, will most likely be the easiest method for the equipment and skills available to the types of persons using this guide.


If the pump is 3/4hp or less on 100' or less drop pipe, and the drop pipe is Schedule 80 PVC or HDPE (black poly)you may consider pulling it by hand, if you and your assistant are strong enough. If it is HDPE, pulling by hand is the primary option, since it does not have jointed sections, other than possibly a hold-down, or a short section of galvanized steel pipe below the pitless.
If you have a well seal or Morrison head, undo the connection between the drop pipe and outlet line that is above ground. On a well seal, use a wrench or ratchet to loosen the bolts on the seal. After you do this, pull the drop pipe up through the seal a foot or so, and attach a pipe dog, using the guidelines below to properly set the tightness.
Preset the tightness of your pipe dogs using the T-handle as a guide. The pipe dog is set correctly when it takes a moderate or slightly more resistance to close it around the pipe. If your drop pipe turns out to be Sch, 80 or HDPE, you will need to adjust a bit more when the moment comes to use it. Be sure to not overtighten with these materials, as they may deform or break. Do not under tighten, as the loss of the well pump and pipe may result.
Attach the winch or derrick line to the T-handle or around the pipe dog. Do this with a chain, in a way such that the it will not come off the T-handle or pipe dog, and the handle of the pipe dog will not be accidentally released.
Unseat the pitless by tightening the winch or derrick line and using it to pull the T-handle up. Use a small sledgehammer to tap up on the bottom side of one of the T-handle handles to assist with this. Do not pound on it forcefully. You will know the pitless has unseated by the sudden release of tension, and you will most probably hear water gush out. Guide the pitless out of the side of the well casing and straight up, stopping when the pitless is approximately 18 inches (45.7 cm) above the top of the casing Clamp with a pipe dog, ensuring to set it on the top of the casing, and to not pinch the wire, release the tension from the cable and remove the T-handle. If the pitless will not unseat, stop, and consult a professional.

Check that the pitless has its O-ring(s), and that it(they) are in good shape. Replace with an exact replacement if necessary. Replacement with anything not an exact replacement may result in the pitless not being able to seat properly, or leaking.
During this process have the assistant hang on to the wire, guiding it out of the casing, cutting where it is taped onto the pipe(taking care not to nick the wire), and feeling for any defects or bare spots there may be on the wire.
If you have a well seal, this step is pulling up 18 inches (45.7 cm), unseating the well seal with a prybar or flathead screwdriver, raising the seal so you can clamp the second pipe dog on below the well seal and then taking the well seal off the pipe.


Proceed to pull the pipe and pump by attaching the chain under the pipe dog in a way such that it cannot come off. If you are using a winch, you will only be able to pull it in small increments. If you are using a derrick, and the boom is long enough, you may be able to pull entire sections of pipe. If not, pull in smaller increments.

If your drop pipe is galvanized steel, it comes in 21 feet (6.4 m). lengths,typically. If it is Sch. 80 PVC, it is in 20 feet (6.1 m). sections. If it is HDPE, it does not come in sections. As mentioned earlier, pulling HDPE by hand is the most viable option, and should be attempted first.
In 4-5"" casings, rust buildup on the inside may cause the pump to hang up, or not allow a new pump to go down. If this is the case, consult a professional to work out a viable solution to the problem. Do not force the pump and pipe to go anywhere it does not want to, as the consequences can be dire.
Pull the pipe and pump up out of the casing. With a winch or short boom derrick, pull a couple (5 for the short boom derrick) feet at a time, attach the other pipe dog, at the top of the well casing or slightly above, set down, undo chain, and upper pipe dog. Reattach chain to lower pipe dog, same as before. Repeat until you have reached the first coupling. At this point attach the pipe dog below the coupling. If using a derrick with a long enough boom, this is the first point where you stop and clamp the pipe.



, Unscrew the pipe out of the top of the coupling. Do not unscrew the coupling off of the pipe below.




If the pipe is galvanized steel pipe, inspect each section for rust. If the pipe is rusty, and/or covered with blisters of rust, do not reuse the pipe. Replace with new galvanized, or Sch. 80 PVC. Take extreme care with the pipe in the air, as you unscrew it as it is heavy, and serious injury or damage may result to persons or property hit by the pipe as it comes to the ground.
Take care with Sch. 80 PVC to not over extend the pipe, as it will break. Take care to not damage the threads on the pipe or couplings.
Use the piece of 2"" Sch. 40 PVC as an extension to give yourself leverage if you're having trouble getting the pipe to come unscrewed.


Repeat the process until you have the pipe and pump out.

,


Run a continuity test on the wire you just pulled with the old pump, if no obvious defects were found. If there is continuity, reuse. If not, replace the wire.

The wiring kit should have three butt connectors, and three shrink tubes. Slide the shrink tubes onto the pump wires before connecting the wires. Crimp well, so the wire doesn't pull out of the butt connectors, and seal by centering the shrink tubes over the connections, using the propane torch to shrink


If you have a 6"" or larger well, there will be a torque arrestor(it looks like a rubber football with four pieces missing) Make sure it is in good condition. Replace if needed. If there is not one, put one on, with the bottom about 6 inches (15 cm) above the pump. ""Balloon"" the torque arrestor out so it is about the same size as the well casing or slightly less. Not having it enough will make the torque arrestor ineffective.

, When installing well pumps, debris and rust is stirred up in the casing, and bacteria can get in through the top, which can cause problems.

, Be sure to tape the wire well, and use enough pipe dope on the threads. Lower the submersible pump into the well casing with the winch or derrick line. Stop when the pitless is 18–24 inches (45.7–61.0 cm) above the casing. Clamp with a pipe dog.

, Do this by wiring the pump wire back up to the other wire, and turning the power back on. The pump will pump the water out and onto the ground.


After the completion of everything, you may choose to continue to run off more water through an outside garden hose bibb. This will flush the water through the pressure tank.

If you have any filters, screens, or softeners, beware that they may become plugged up by small flakes of rust stirred up by the pump replacement procedure. Running it over the top a bit longer can go a long way towards prevention, but, is not 100 percent effective.



, Use the high-powered flashlight to see down the casing to help you.


This step can be very difficult. Make sure to get it right. or get help to get it right.
If you have a horizontal-seating pitless (i.e. Mass J-Series or similar) tap the top of the T-handle to seat the pitless the rest of the way.
If you have a vertical-seating pitless(Advance or similar) and it was on galvanized steel pipe, and was replaced with Sch. 80, add a hold down before turning on pump. Due to the difference in the hanging weight, a pitless of this type may unseat otherwise.

,, Normal water service should be restored.


In spite of chlorination, it is required in many jurisdictions to submit a water sample for bacteria testing. Treat the water as unsafe for drinking purposes, pending the results of the test.

Use a pressure tank without a diaphragm.,
Attach the top of the tank to a tee along the incoming horizontal supply water line.,
Next, continue the water supply line by attaching a nipple then an elbow and then continue to the bottom of the tank, through a union.,
In the middle of the tank, mount the air volume control.,Continue the house plumbing at the other side of the tank at the bottom.,There is one remaining hole in the FP7230 which is a 1/4""NPT connection, one may plug it or attach the pressure switch there, such as in this figure.,
Leak test and operate the system.",How to Install a Pressure Tank for a Morrison Head System," In this example, the Flotec 42 gallon (159.0 L) epoxy lined water tank FP7230 was used. Use such a tank because the air must come out the top of the tank to purge the line which goes above ground at the Morrison head, preventing it from freezing. One cannot set up a precharged tank according to this diagram. N.B. If a precharged tank is used, the system will not work and the Morrison head will freeze. Please refer to the image.

, This way, the momentum of the travelling water will help it to continue travelling past this tee whose purpose is to allow air from the top of the tank to pass back to the well. To attach the top of the tank to this tee, install elbows, piping, and a recommended union, plumbed as appropriate for the placement of the installed water supply line and the size of the tank to be used. Do not use a check valve to try to sort the air from the water, it is costly and unnecessary. Two 24"" pipe wrenches are necessary to remove the plug at the top of the tank, since it is affixed so well., At this point, one may tee to a drain valve or a relief valve. For the FP7230, the relief valve should operate at 75psi with a flow rated at the pump's capacity. No relief valve is shown in this image; the relief valve is only necessary if the pump can supply more than 75 psi., In this example there is a Johnson Controls' F93B. Air is constantly pumped into the tank by the Morrison head system, and this air volume control bleeds the excess out of the system. Without this control, the system will work but with much air in the outgoing plumbing. The pressure gauge or pump pressure switch may be mounted on this control using 1/4"" NPT. Brass or copper fittings may be used here since the F93B is non-conductive.,,, If there is a blow-down connection for compressed air as in this diagram, leak test can be done using air and soap bubbles."

Consult geologic and topographic maps.,
Ask people who live near the property.,

Get whatever well-drilling permits you need.",How to Drill a Well1," Drilling a well involves a higher initial cost than connecting to a public water supply, as well as risks of not finding enough water or water of sufficient quality and ongoing costs to pump the water and maintain the well. However, some water districts may make residents wait years before they can be connected to a public supply, thus making well drilling a viable option where there is enough groundwater at a reasonable depth.;
, You'll need to know the section, township, range and quarters to access land and well records through your state's geological survey or from your State Watermaster.

, Geological survey records or state well drilling reports will record the depths of previous wells in the area and whether or not they found water. You can access these records in person, by telephone or online. These records can help you determine the depth of the water table, as well as the location of any confined aquifers.


Most aquifers are at the depth of the water table; these are called unconfined aquifers, as all the material above them is porous. Confined aquifers are covered by nonporous layers, which, although they push the static water level above the top of the aquifer, are more difficult to drill into.







, Although less useful than well-drilling records, geologic maps can show the general location of aquifers, as well as the rock formations in an area. Topographic maps show the surface features and their elevations and can be used to plot well locations. Together, they can determine whether an area has sufficient groundwater to make drilling a well viable.


Water tables are not uniformly level, but follow ground contours to some extent. The water table is nearer the surface in valleys, particularly those formed by rivers or creeks, and is harder to access at higher elevations.

, Many older wells have no documentation, and even if records exist, someone who lived nearby may remember how much water those wells produced.

, Your state's geological survey personnel may be able to answer general questions and direct you to resources beyond those mentioned here. If you need more detailed information than what they can provide, you may need the services of a professional hydrologist.


Contact local well drilling companies, especially ones that have been established for a long time.
A 'Dowser' or 'Water Witcher' is a person who uses willow branches, brass rods or similar items to search for water. If you want, you might employ one to help you find a good site.

, Consult the appropriate municipal and state agencies to find out what permits you need to obtain before drilling and any regulations that govern drilling wells.

Determine whether you need to call a pro.,
What purpose will your well serve?,
Select your proposed site.,
Find the correct pump.,
Constructing the bore.,
The top few feet of the annular space outside the pipe should be sealed with bentonite or neat cement to keep the well sanitary.,
The well must be decontaminated with a chlorine solution, your pumping system installed, and the well pumped again.,
Follow these instructions and with luck you will construct a well that will serve you for many years into the future.

",How to Construct a Water Well," If you have no experience in well construction and your strata/formation is rock, your best option is to call a professional for you will have to have very expensive equipment to construct a well under these conditions. That being said, if your strata/formation is unconsolidated (that is not rock) you have a good chance of constructing a well on your own.;
, Do you plan to use your well for home use, or do you wish to flood a rice field? The intended use will dictate the size necessary to serve the purpose. If you plan to flood a rice field, call in the professionals.

, Locate your well where it is least likely to be contaminated by waste from septic systems or barnyards. Check your neighbors wells as well. Find out what type of wells and the depth of neighboring wells. This will give you an idea of how your well will need to be constructed.

, If the static level (the level where water stands while the well is not being pumped) or the pumping level (the level where water stands while the well is being pumped) is 26 feet (7.9 m) or less, you can use a centrifugal pump to produce water from your well. If the water level is deeper, you will have to use a different pumping system such as a deep well jet, a sucker rod action piston pump, or a submersible pump. For home use where the water is shallow a centrifugal pump is well suited and economical and you can use a 2 inch (5.1 cm) pipe and screen for your well. However, if your water is deeper, you will have to use a different pumping system which will require a larger pipe and screen in most cases. A 4 inch (10.2 cm) pipe and screen is adequate for most home wells. A deep well jet, a submersible pump, or a piston pump can be installed inside a 4 inch (10.2 cm) well.

, This can be accomplished in several ways such as drilling with an augur, jetting the pipe into place, or washing the well down. I prefer the wash down method as follows. Dig two holes about 3 feet (0.9 m) in diameter and two feet deep. Pile the material from the holes around the outside creating a berm. Construct the holes as level with each other as practical and dig a shallow trench between the holes. One hole will be used to pump from and the other will be used to capture the cutting from the well bore. Use a one and one/half inch steel pipe coupling and weld two blades (one on each side) to it and secure enough one and one/half"" schedule 40 PVC pipe to reach the depth of your neighbors wells, which are located at your well site elevation. Cut the pipe into 5 foot (1.5 m) sections and solvent weld male and female threaded fittings to opposite ends of the sections. Construct a ""tee"" handle of one and one/half steel pipe consisting of a ""tee"" and two 6 inch (15.2 cm) nipples. Cap one end off of a nipple with a pipe cap and install a camlock fitting on the other end of the handle. Secure a trash pump (at least a 2 inch discharge) and suction hose with a strainer, and discharge hose with fittings to connect to your tee handle. Attach the cutter you constructed from the steel coupling to the PVC drill pipe section (tight) and screw the tee handle to the opposite end and connect to the discharge hose from your pump. Fill the two holes full of water and keep them full at all times while you are constructing your well. The weight of the water serves to keep the bore from caving--hopefully! Start your pump and begin boring your well by jetting down the drill pipe located just outside the edge of the settling hole (but inside the berm). Turn the pipe with the tee handle as you jet to assure the hole is round. Cut loose the material from the bottom of the hole. When the tee handle reaches the ground, let the well circulate for a while to wash the cutting clear of the hole (it will take longer each time to accomplish this as the hole gets deeper.) When each section is down and the hole is clear of cuttings, stop the pump and remove the tee handle, attach another joint of drill pipe and replace the tee handle. Start the pump and repeat the process until you have reached the required depth. Remember: Keep the holes full of water and remove the cuttings from the setting hole. If the pipe descends too fast, the cuttings will ""bridge"" between the cutter and the surface causing you to lose circulation. This will cause your drill pipe to stick in the hole and you probably won't be able to remove it--so take your time while drilling. Let the hole wash out clean. Check the material coming out of the hole for sand and small rock which indicates water bearing strata in most cases. If you're at the depth of your neighbors wells and you are recovering sand and/or small rock you probably have a well. Have your screen ready with a cap installed and ample pipe to reach the bottom of the hole. After the hole is washed clean of cuttings, remove the drill string as quickly as possible, then install the screen and pipe in the hole as fast as you can keeping the hole full of water at all times. Slowly pour a mixture of course sand and pea gravel down outside of the casing pipe to gravel pack the screen (water will flood out of the pipe while this is being done until the screen is covered.) Do not fill with gravel to the surface as that would allow surface water and foreign matter to enter the well.

, This can be done after the well is pumped off (preferably with a large air compressor) which will clear the drilling fluid and materials from the well. The well should be pumped until the water is clear.

, Then and only then, you should have the water tested to assure that it is safe to use. Remember: seal the well to keep it clean.

Drill the well away from any potential contaminants.,
Decide how you want to drill the well.,
Finish the well.",How to Drill a Well2," Animal feedlots, buried fuel tanks, waste disposal and septic systems can all pollute groundwater. Wells should be drilled in places where they can easily be reached for maintenance, and located at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) from building sites.


Every states has regulations regarding where wells can be located as well as setbacks that you must follow. The well driller should be very familiar with these.

, Most wells are drilled out, but wells may also be dug or driven, if conditions warrant. Drilled wells may be bored with an auger or rotary tool, smashed out with a percussion cable or cut with high-pressure jets of water.


Wells are dug when there is sufficient water near the surface and no intervening dense rock. After a hole is made with shovels or power equipment, a casing is lowered into the aquifer, and the well is then sealed against contamination. Wells no deeper than 20 feet (6.1 m) are usually classified as 'Ground Water.' As they are shallower than driven or drilled wells, they are more likely to go dry when drought lowers the water table. They are often contaminated with chloroform or E. Coli bacteria, so it is important to have them tested regularly.






Wells are driven by attaching a steel driving point to a stiff screen or perforated pipe, which is connected to solid pipe. An initial hole wider than the pipe is dug, then the assembly is pounded into the ground, with occasional turnings to keep the connections tight, until the point penetrates the aquifer. Wells can be hand-driven to depths of 30 feet (9 meters) and power-driven to depths of 50 feet (15 meters). Because the pipe used is of small diameter (1.25 to 12 inches, or 3 to 30 centimeters), multiple wells are often driven to provide sufficient water.






Augers can be either rotating buckets or continuous stems and can be turned either by hand or with power equipment. They work best in soils with enough clay to support the auger and don't work well in sandy soil or dense rock. Auger-bored wells can be drilled to depths of 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) by hand and up to 125 feet (37.5 meters) with power augers, with diameters ranging from 2 to 30 inches (5 to 75 centimeters).






Rotary drills exude water based drilling fluid such as a bentonite clay slurry to keep the hole open. They may use an additive to reduce heat, clean the bit, and remove debris. The high-pressure compressed air in a rotating bit make drilling easier while pumping out the drill cuttings. Typically the driller will use an oversized dual or tri-cone roller bit to drill down through softer strata until it reaches a solid strata formation. A smaller steel well casing is inserted at this point. These can drill to depths of 1000 feet (300 meters) or more, creating holes from 3 to 24 inches (7.5 to 30 centimeters) wide. While they can drill faster than other drills through most materials, they have trouble drilling through rock in boulder formations. While the drilling fluid makes it tough to identify material from water-bearing strata, the drill operator can use water and air to flush the well and determine whether or not the aquifer has been reached.






Percussion cables work like pile drivers, with bit or tool moving up and down on a cable to pulverize the ground being drilled into. As with rotary cable drills, water is used to loosen and remove intervening materials, but it does not flow from the drill bit. Rather, it is added from the top manually. After a while, the cutting tool is replaced by a 'Bailing' tool. Percussion cables can drill to the same depths as rotary drills, albeit much more slowly and at higher cost, but they can smash through materials that would slow rotary bits. Often when drilling in more solid rock formations, a cable tool rig may be more efficient in finding small fissures of water than a rotary air machine as the rotary air drill seals off such fissures with high air pressure.






High-pressure water jets use the same equipment as rotary drills, without the bit, as the water both cuts the hole and lifts out drilled material. This method takes only minutes, but jet-drilled wells can be no more than 50 feet (15 meters) deep, and the drilling water needs to be treated to prevent it from contaminating the aquifer when the water table is penetrated.







, Once the well is drilled, casing is inserted to prevent the water from wearing away and being contaminated by the sides of the well. This casing is usually narrower in diameter than the well hole itself. The most common type for domestic installations is 6 inches (15 cm) in size. They are frequently made out of steel or Schedule 40 PVC. They can be sealed in place with a grouting material, commonly either clay or concrete. To prevent ground water contamination, a bag to filter out sand and gravel is inserted in the casing, then the well is capped with a sanitary seal. Unless it is an Artesian Well and the water is already under pressure, a pump is attached to bring the water to the surface.


Sometimes for the steel casing, a perforator tool is inserted and slowly pulled up to determine the the depth of the water. Using the drill's compressed air at low volume, it drives a wedge out into the casing multiple times, cutting an opening for water to flow into the casing.
In sandy soils, a solid piece of casing 5–10 feet (1.5–3.0 m) in length may be used. These have a steel laser-cut slotted screen in a 10 feet (3.0 m) section welded to the top of the casing or a solid casing welded to top of a slotted screen. For extremely sandy soils, a 4 inch PVC pipe and screen is inserted inside the steel casing. Small 'pea' gravel is slowly poured outside of PVC liner casing but inside of the steel casing. This improves the filtration of sand.

Contamination sources are the most important thing to keep in mind for any new well.,
Find out the local rules for the minimum safe distance from the contamination sources that you've found.,
Locate all the areas on your property that meet or exceed the recommended distances from nearby contamination sources.,
Locate the highest ground within the acceptable area, as this is usually the safest spot to construct a well.,
Do your homework.,
Ask around for referrals to certified well-drillers, and always research a contractor before hiring them.",How to Choose a Well Site," You must locate all potential contamination sources on or near your property. These include, but aren't limited to:


Septic tanks and septic leach fields.
Stockyards and livestock barns.
Petroleum tanks and other chemical tanks, both above ground and below ground.
Fertilizer storage and/or application sites (croplands).
Manure stacks or effluent pools.
Saltwater intrusion from the coast.
Any streams, rivers, or lakes that have flooded any part of your property in the last 100 years.
Natural deposits of metals/minerals (like arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, selenium, or fluoride).
Call your county health officer for a list of contamination sources relevant to your area.;
, State/county websites are a good source of information, as is your county health office. Most places have several layers of regulation, so it's important to check with the most local regulating body to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and guidelines.

, Remember that further is better.

, Groundwater flows downhill and towards discharge locations (rivers and lakes), so choose a spot where the groundwater is probably not flowing from a contamination source (ranch, farm, sinkhole, landfill, neighbor's septic system).

,


Find out about wells in your area.
Become acquainted with the basic hydrology of your region - groundwater availability and safety is heavily determined by your local soils, geology, and water table.
If your neighbors have a well, ask how deep it is, what testing they have had done, and if they will let you see the results - or offer to have their water tested for them.
If you can, talk to someone at a local water testing lab or talk to a local university hydrologist.

, Once you have located a well-drilling company you can trust, listen to what their experts say about your property and best potential sites. It may be that the site you have in mind isn't viable for any number of reasons, so it's always best to leave your options open and not get too attached to any one location.

Plan the shape of your berm.,
Determine the slope and height.,
Consider the drainage.,
Break up the soil lightly.,
Build the base from affordable materials .,
Add the topsoil layer.,
Compact the soil lightly.,
Plant on the surface.",How to Build a Berm1," A berm looks most natural when it follows a curve or sinuous shape, blending into other curves in the landscape.As a guideline, keep the berm about 4 to 6 times as long as it is wide., To minimize problems with erosion, water runoff, and mowing difficulty, keep the maximum gradient below 5:1 (five times as wide as it is tall). 4:1 is possible but risky, and anything steeper requires specialized plants and erosion control.Most berms in home gardens are no taller than 24 inches (61 cm).An asymmetric appearance improves the aesthetics, with an off-center peak and a variety of slopes along the berm's length.

, Berms can act as miniature dams, altering the water flow in your garden. You may need to dig swales between the berms, build a culvert running through the berm, or regrade your garden.You may want to discuss this with a professional landscaper if you are building a tall berm (especially above 24 inches / 61 cm), or if you live in a rainy climate.A flat top reduces runoff and provides more water to plants growing on the side of the berm.While building your berm, do your best to avoid compacting the soil at the base with heavy equipment. If it's already compacted, loosen the soil by digging 8 inches (20 cm) deep to improve drainage., Dig into the surface of the area along the path of your berm. This creates a stronger bond with the next layer of soil., With a shovel or bobcat, pile on fill dirt, compacting it periodically. Shape it according to the layout you decided on, except 1 ft (30 cm) smaller on all sides. Rake it smooth and get all proportions as exact as possible.Well-compacted clay soil is recommended for steep or tall berms. Loam will typically collapse at slopes steeper than 35%.Gravel is cheaper, but the soil tends to wash through it — and it is not compliant with some local codes. If you use it, cover it with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of compacted clay., Spread out a layer of topsoil over the entire berm, mixing it with the top 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) of clay.Pile on more topsoil to form a layer 1 ft (30 cm) thick.

, Roll an empty lawn roller over the top layer of soil, or tamp it down with your feet or a board.The berm will settle over time as water seeps through it, but a light compaction should be enough to minimize erosion.

, Establish a lawn over the berm, along with shrubs and trees in a pattern that doesn't interfere with mowing or walking. Add mulch while the plants are establishing roots to prevent erosion.

Plan the shape and location of the berm.,
Clear all organic material from the area.,
Build a retaining wall if necessary.,
Tamp down a thin layer of dirt.,
Direct water off the trail.,
Build the berm up in layers.,
Perfect the surface.",How to Build a Berm2," Also called an inslope turn, a berm is a turn with a surface tilted toward the inside of the curve, helping bikers navigate it smoothly without losing speed. Whether your berm is a slight curve or a full semicircle, keep the radius between 10 and 15 feet (3–45.m). The slope of the berm can be as gentle as a 7% slope, but steep downhill turns require a steeper angle.Building the turn around a tree, large rock, or other obstacle discourages bikers from short-cutting the turn. Make sure the obstacle doesn't block line of sight, and that it's not close enough to hit someone's head when they lean into the turn.
For your first berm, avoid a sideslope (slope between the two sides of the turn) steeper than a 4:1 gradient (25%). Steeper slopes require a turning platform, which takes a lot more work.

, This includes topsoil, which will decompose and crumble if used on your trail. Build your berm with bare, mineral soil only., Steep berms and berms built onto steep slopes require a retaining wall to prevent collapse. This is a big job, so consider working with experienced builders, or building a berm with a gentle slope instead (10 degrees, for instance). There are two approaches if you decide to go this route:


Flat, square stones weighing at least 50 lbs (23 kg) make the best retaining walls. Lock the stones together with smaller rocks and ""deadmen"" logs extending into the bank to prevent wobbling, then backfill each layer with small rocks and mineral soil.Wooden retaining walls take less labor, but rot over time. Use pressure treated wood rated for ground contact (""heavy duty"" or ""extreme"" ground contact in wet climates).Lay deadmen logs into the bank, attached to the wall with notched log cabin construction., To support mountain biking without eroding, the berm must be extra sturdy. Lay down 2–4 inches (5–10 cm) along the turn in the trail, and compact it as hard as you can using a McLeod rake or hoe. Trying to compact the whole pile of dirt at once will create a weak berm that won't hold together for long.The soil must compact and cohere well. If it is too loose and sandy, mix in clay fill.Powered compaction tools are difficult to use for this project, since they flatten the curve of the riding surface.

, As you build, incorporate a wide drain at the downhill edge of the turn to direct water off the trail surface. Add a slight grade in the opposite direction before and after your turn for the same reason., Rough up the surface of the berm a little, add another 2–4 inches (5–10 cm) of soil, and compact again. Repeat this to build the berm to the desired shape and height.


The rough surface helps the layers attach to each other, improving strength. A light sprinkle of water also helps.You can incorporate small rocks in the lower layers, but the top surface should be pure mineral soil only.

, Once your berm has reached the desired height and shape, make the surface as smooth as possible, with a constant slope. Give the berm a test ride and make adjustments until the turn feels smooth. For instance, if the turn feels too abrupt, you may need a wider radius, or a longer lead up into the berm."

Place a 55 gallon (208.2 L) drum next to the casing pipe on the side with the longest run of road or open space. If possible, put a few loops of baling wire around to tie it to the casing pipe.






Fasten the flange onto the hitch ball of a car or truck, or to the rear bumper.
Have the car move slowly forward until the pump is out. If the flexible pipe starts to heat up due to friction against the drum, slow the car, or pour soapy water onto the barrel as a cooling lubricant as it's being pulled.


Brute force method:
Two or more muscular people take turns pulling. Once you start this method, there's no resting until the pump is all the way out, though it does get easier the closer you get to the end.



, Likewise, be sure to sanitize the pump, pipe and electrical cabling before replacing it into the well."

Don't allow the well to run dry.",How to Chlorinate a Well," It is a good idea to chlorinate your well at least once a year, preferably in the spring. Outside of that, there are several other circumstances under which chlorinating your well becomes necessary:


If your annual water test results show that bacteria is present.
If you notice a change in the color, smell or taste of your drinking water, you should test for bacteria and will need to chlorinate the water if the test comes up positive. You should also determine the water constituent that caused the change in water quality and take measures to treat the water to remove anything unpleasant or unsafe. Your local environmental agency will be able to provide direction in this endeavor.
If the well is new, or has recently undergone repairs, or new pipes have been added.
If the well has been contaminated by flood water, or if the water turns muddy or cloudy after a rainfall.When you are preparing to abandon the well or if it is a well that is new to you.;
,



Chlorine: Obviously you will need chlorine in order to chlorinate your well. You could use HTH chlorine tablets or granules, but this article assumes that you are using a 5% solution (or greater) of regular household chlorine bleach. Just be sure to use an unscented variety. You may need up to 10 gallons (37.9 L) of bleach, depending on the volume of water within your well and the strength of the bleach.

Chlorine test kit: A chlorine test kit can be used to precisely measure chlorine levels in the water, rather than relying on scent alone. These test kits are usually used for swimming pools and can be found at any pool or spa supply store. Make sure to get OTO liquid drops instead of the paper strips, as the paper strips only indicate chlorine levels in the range that is ideal for swimming pools.

Garden hose: To recirculate the water in the well, you will need a clean garden hose. Some sources recommend using a hose with a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) diameter, rather than the standard 5⁄8 inch (1.6 cm) size. If you can get the larger hose through the wellhead casing and past the wiring and piping, it may be a better option, as it will provide a larger flow of water. You should cut the male end of the hose at a steep angle.

, In order to determine how much bleach you will need to adequately disinfect your well, you will need to calculate the volume of water it contains. To do this, you will need to multiply the depth of the water column (in feet) by the gallons per linear foot for your well. This depends on the diameter of the well or casing (in inches).


To get the depth of water in your well, you will need to measure the distance from the bottom of the well to the waterline. First, shut off all power for the wellhead at the breaker. Remove the well cap or access the wellhead through the venting opening. Use a strong flashlight to inspect down the casing. Using a fishing line and a moderately heavy weight, drop the line into the water. The line will remain taut until the weight hits the bottom, at which time it will go limp. Once this happens, retrieve the line and measure the wet portion of the string with a tape measure.
You can also mark the line at the top of the well casing and measure the total depth of the well, then subtract the distance from the top of the casing to the surface of the water within the well. This can be found by tying a short stick securely to the line, lowering the stick into the well, marking the line when it goes slack, and measuring the length of the line from the stick to your mark.
Alternatively, a rough measurement should be stamped on a plate affixed to the slab poured around the well casing or you can contact the drilling company who constructed the well. They are required to keep records on all of the wells they've worked on in most jurisdictions. You can also check with the State Water Master or Governing Licensing Board of Well Drillers and Pump Installers.
The number of gallons per linear foot is related to the diameter of the well casing. This number should appear on the well log. Drilled wells will usually have a diameter between 4 and 10 inches, whereas bored wells range between 12 and 26. Once you know the diameter of your well, you can use this table to figure out the gallons per linear foot of water within your well.
Now that you have measurements for the depth of the water in the well (in feet) and the amount of water per linear foot in gal/foot), you can multiply these numbers by each other to get the total volume of water in your well. You will need to use 3 pints of 5% chlorine bleach for every 100 gallons (378.5 L) of water in your well, plus an extra 3 pints to treat the water in the household plumbing.

, The process of chlorinating a well takes time, usually one to two days. During this time you will be unable to use water from the well for daily household tasks, so it is important that you plan accordingly. A good time to chlorinate is right before you leave for a weekend getaway or a more lengthy vacation.


During the chlorination process there is more chlorine in your water supply than a swimming pool, making it unsafe to consume. In addition, if you use too much water, the chlorine will end up in your septic tank and kill the bacteria necessary for decomposing waste.
For these reasons, you will need to use bottled water for drinking and cooking, and refrain from using any sinks or showers. You should also try to keep toilet flushing to a minimum.,, Depending on the type of well, you may need to open the vent pipe in order to pour in the chlorine.


The vent pipe should be located on the wellhead, it's usually about 6 inches (15.2 cm) in length and 1/2 an inch in diameter. Open the vent by unscrewing the pipe from the seal.
Alternatively, you may be able to remove the cover from the top of the well, which may require removing a few screws.

, Once you have access to the well, carefully pour the correct amount of bleach through a funnel into the access hole, avoiding any electrical connections.


You may want to wear protective gloves, goggles and an apron when handling the undiluted bleach.
If any bleach should get on your skin, rinse it off immediately with clean water.

, Attach the female end of the hose to the nearest spigot, then run the male end (cut off at an angle) into the hole left by the vent pipe, or directly into the well.


If the hose is not long enough to reach the well, connect additional hoses.

, Double-check that all electrical connections are waterproof before turning on the circuit breaker, then the water on at full volume. Leave it to recirculate for at least an hour.


The running water from the hose forces the water at the bottom of the well to flow to the surface, distributing the chlorine evenly.
This ensures that any bacteria in the well water will be exposed to and killed by the chlorine.

, After the water has been recirculating for at least an hour, you can test for chlorine in your water supply. You can do this in one of two ways:


Pull the hose out of the vent and use the chlorine test kit to test for the present of chlorine in the water coming out of the hose.
Alternatively, you can run an outdoor faucet to see if you can detect the smell of chlorine in the water.
If the chlorine test comes up negative, or you cannot smell chlorine in the water supply, continue to recirculate the water for another 15 minutes, then check again.

, Once you have detected chlorine in the water, re-insert the hose and vigorously swirl it around to wash any chlorine residue from the well casing and pump piping. Once you've done that for 10 or 15 minutes, turn off the hose and replace well lid or reinsert the vent pipe.

, Go inside and test for the presence of chlorine at every sink bath and shower, using either the test kit or your sense of smell.


Don't forget to test both the hot and cold faucets and also remember to run any addition outdoor spigots until chlorine is detected.
You should also flush each toilet in the house once or twice.

, Leave the chlorine to sit in the water supply for a minimum of 12 hours, but preferably 24. During this time, do your best to keep water use to a minimum.

, After 24 hours, your water will be completely disinfected and you can begin the process of removing chlorine from your water supply.


To do this, attach as many hoses as you have outdoor spigots and tie the ends around a tree or fence approximately three feet off the ground. This makes it easier to monitor the water flow.
Don't run the water anywhere near the septic tank or leach field, as you don't want to expose these areas to the chlorinated water.

, Turn on each of the spigots and run the water as hard as possible. Try to direct the stream of water into a ditch or somewhere the water will be somewhat contained.


Just make sure that the ditch does not lead to a stream or pond, as the chlorinated water will kill off fish and other animal and plant life.

, Periodically check the water coming out of the hoses for the presence of chlorine.


Use the chlorine test kit for this, as you may be unable to detect small quantities of chlorine by smell alone.

, Boring as it may be, it is important to keep an eye on the water flow at all times, to ensure that the well doesn't run dry.


If the well runs dry, the pump may burn out, and these can be very expensive to replace. If it looks like water pressure is dropping off, turn off power to the pump and wait an hour before resuming the run-off. This gives the well a chance to refill itself.
Only stop the water flow when all traces of chlorine have been removed -- this may take as little as two hour or much longer, depending on the well.

Solidify the ring.,
Fill in the edges.,
Fill the center.,
Add a decorative edge.,
Enjoy your pit!",How to Build a Backyard Firepit1," The hole should be 1.5' deep and 5' wide. Get it as flat as possible on the bottom.;
, Buy a bunch of firebricks (used to line fireplaces). There should be enough that you can make a circle to your desired size with the bricks standing on their ends. Form the circle in the hole by standing the bricks on end and putting one next to the other.








, Use concrete, cobb, clay, or other fire-resistant materials to join the bricks together into a solid, strong ring. Let this material dry completely before continuing.








, Fill in any space outside the circle with dirt. This is so the ground leads right up to the top edge of the brick.

, Pour a layer of river rocks into the central pit.








, Get some paving stones or garden stones (the kind you usually use to make a path with) and use them to form a ring around the fire pit.

, Be careful not to let grass overgrow the stones and get too close to the fire.

Light your fire!",How to Build a Backyard Firepit3," These are sometimes referred to as tree rings. The edging will need to be made of stone, clay, or brick and can be scalloped or straight across the top. You will need to purchase 4 pieces of 14"" inside diameter bricks and 6 pieces of 24"" inside diameter bricks.

, Clear an appropriate area for your firepit and then lay out the first two 14"" pieces to form a circle. Use three of the 24"" to form a larger circle around the first one. You can use a bit of concrete to help the pieces stay together, if you want.

, Use the remaining pieces to set out the second layer, on top of the first. You can put a layer of concrete between the two stone layers, if you want to. If you use scalloped bricks, put the second layer upside down, so the scalloped edges are touching between the two layers.

, Fill the gap between the circles with river rocks until the brim is reached. Alternatively, you can fill it most of the way to full and then put down a thinner layer of more aesthetically pleasing rocks, like glass pebbles.

, Put a small layer of river rocks or other fire-friendly material in the bottom of the pit.


Alternatively, you can find a grill bowl with the same diameter (or very slightly larger) as the central circle and place it there.

, Set up a wood fire in the central pit and enjoy your new fire pit. Put a circular grill surface over the hole to use it as an outdoor cooking pit!

Know the building and zoning codes for your area.,
Choose a location that's well drained.,
Check which way the wind blows.",How to Build a Barn1," These will determine what kind of barn you can or can't build and provide a starting point for planning your barn.;
, Ideally, you want to build a barn on a site with enough slope for water to drain away, but not so much slope that it takes soil with it.

, Spend time at your prospective site studying the wind patterns to find which way the wind usually blows the strongest from. Once you determine the prevailing direction, plan the barn layout to be at a 45 degree angle to this direction so that you'll have excellent air circulation without turning the barn's center aisle into a wind tunnel.


If the wind blows equally strong from all 4 directions an equal amount of the time, consider building a barn in a square layout with an entrance on each side. You can then open and close entryways as needed to provide adequate ventilation.

Drill a 1/2"" diameter hole in the rock about 18"" deep.,
Clean out the hole.,
Pour about 3/4 of a fluid ounce of gunpowder into the hole using a small funnel.,
Place an appropriate length of cannon fuse in the hole.,
Backfill the remaining hole by balling up modeling clay into 1/8"" balls, dropping them into the hole, and tamping them down with a 1/4"" wooden dowel.,
Place sandbags tightly around the hole.

,
Make sure that nobody is in the area, light the fuse, and then EVACUATE.

,
Notes: You can adjust the hole depth, powder charge, and hole distance from the rock face to meet your requirements.","How to Blast, or Break Rock With Blasting Powder, Gun Powder"," The hole should be placed so that it is 12"" - 18"" in from the rock face that you are trying to break. Use a hammer drill with a masonry bit to do this.;
, You can get it mostly cleaned out with the drill. For better results, attach a 24"" long, 1/4"" diameter aluminum tube to a bicycle pump. Stick the tube in the hole and blow it out by pumping the bicycle pump.

, A graduated cooking shot glass works well to measure the powder.

, Be sure to know the burn rate of the fuse, and use more than you think you'll need to get out of the area! Also, be sure that you have good fuse / powder connection by corkscrewing the fuse into the powder by an inch or so.

, Tamp down the clay every 5 to 10 balls.

,,, A good blast will just crack the rock. Too much charge or placing the hole too near a rock face will result in 'air burst', where rock flies into the air. This is dangerous and wasteful. Too little charge, or placing the hole too far away from a rock face will result in almost no rock breakage. This method works well when you can drill a hole straight down, or close to straight down. It will not work for placing a charge in overhead rock.

You may always receive on-the-job training to help you obtain a career as a landscaper., Landscapers need to utilize the space and land to make an attractive setting. You must work with the conditions to bring about the best arrangements. Your responsibilities will typically include:


Meeting with clients to discuss the project
Plan and work with garden designers or landscape architects
Order the supplies by creating a budget
Prepare the interior soil or the outdoor grounds
Seed and turf lawns
Prune and plant shrubs and trees
Plant new plants
Install features such as rock gardens, water features, paving, and pathways
Construct gardens with water and rock borders

, The title Landscaper may apply to a number of positions including maintenance worker, groundskeeper, landscape architect, landscape gardener, landscape designer, and landscaper. Research the difference between titles and the requirements for each. You may find that you are passionate about only one area of landscaping and you can focus your time and resources fulfilling the requirements.You may also specialize in interior landscaping such as shopping centers or office buildings., If you are able to find an entry level job, learn as much about landscaping as you can. You may also research online or find landscaping groups via social media. Learn things like trimming, planting, and operating machinery.

Remember that there’s no substitute for experience so if you can’t find something paid immediately, try volunteering your time in exchange for a learning opportunity.

, Research what schools offer programs related to landscaping. Depending on the school, you may earn a certificate in horticulture, landscape design, or other related fields. You may need a certificate if you want to move up to a management position.Make sure you have the time and money to complete the program. You can also take classes part-time. Most employers and clients will expect some level of knowledge and experience in horticulture. Depending on your location, you may be able to get a diploma in Horticulture at a local college.It’s easier to get formal education to understand design drawings, improve your knowledge of plants, and learn how to manage projects. You must learn these skills as well as hone creative skills if you are pursuing a career in landscaping., There are various certifications that your are able to get from a number of organizations depending on your location. Research online what is needed in order to obtain a professional accreditation.For example, you may receive a Tree Care Industry Association Certificate if you are focusing on safety, regulations, and professionalism for tree care. The Professional Landcare Network (PLANET) also offers a certification for numerous areas of landscaping including managers, interior/ exterior specialists, and technicians.
Depending on your location, you may get certified in Practical horticulture or horticulture., You should be able to follow directions and complete projects on your own and as part of a landscaping team. You should also strengthen your body and stamina because you need to be physically able to handle the rigours of landscaping. Be motivated, able to work well with others, organized, dependable, and detail oriented.

, There are apprenticeships available in different areas. Research online or ask local nurseries or landscaping companies if they participate in an apprenticeship or mentorship program., You will need to work enough hours to cover the cost of doing business. You need to be able to maintain your equipment and spend a lot of money upfront to purchase the essentials like a lawnmower. The beginning of your business will be filled with long hours as you try to cover the initial expenditures so be prepared to balance the rest of your schedule around your work.The advantage of building your own business is that, as it grows, you can create your own schedule and work as little or as much as you want as long as you continue to make a profit.

, Depending on your location, there may be cold seasons of several months that you will be unable to work. Make sure you have done enough work during the rest of the year to cover these lean months.For example, if you live somewhere with cold climates, you may only want to rent your more costly equipment so they don’t collect dust during the winter. You may also want to adapt to year round service by offering driveway shoveling or Christmas tree delivery and disposal.
Two thirds of of the U.S. has downtime during the winter so you must market aggressively to maintain a healthy April through October. The winter will shift to services including raking leaves, winterizing lawns, and establishing new clients and revenue streams.

, Purchase your tools depending on the scale of your business. For example, if you will be landscaping yourself, you may only want to purchase a single lawnmower. You may also want to apply for a bank loan or use your credit card to make these initial expenditures as you will only have to pay a very small amount to maintain them throughout the years.Make sure to do your research to purchase quality tools and equipment. You don’t have to purchase top of the line equipment unless you have the capital and know that you will be able to cover the cost within a reasonable amount of time. Find equipment and tools that are durable and capable of accomplishing what you need. You don’t want to waste money on extra functions that will never be used. For example, you won’t need to purchase a riding mower if your clients don’t have large properties. A walking mower is significantly cheaper, easier to transport, and cost less to maintain.Don’t purchase expensive office equipment. Instead, direct your funds to things you’ll use everyday. You may use your home printer or commit to working out of a shared office space once a week. Landscapers are expected to be constantly on location so don’t worry about leasing an office space or setting up an elaborate home office. You’ll basically need a computer, printer, and a filing system to organize invoices and other administrative collateral.

, If you want to command market value or above, you must be more adept at landscaping than your potential clients or competitors. Investing in classes for gardening basics and landscaping techniques can pay dividends later. Learn basics like pruning, trimming, and mowing.There are certifications and even degrees that you can achieve. Depending on your location, you may need certifications to handle things like heavy machinery.

, Landscaping is usually done outdoors which means you will enjoy the sunshine. Don’t be tempted to get in a round of golf or take your family to the lake unless you have budgeted for that time off. You must be diligent when you attend to your clients’ needs to ensure their loyalty. You don’t want to unexpectedly lose a client especially if your margins are thin.Like any service industry, your landscaping business will be built on your reputation. If you work hard and put your clients’ needs first, you can reap the rewards of referrals and sustained business.

, Landscaping can be hard on your body especially if you’re lifting heavy equipment and moving awkwardly shaped rocks and trees all day. Take care of you health by tending to any aches and pains. A nagging injury can develop into something much worse.

While you think you can work through the pain to make money in the short term, you may lose everything in the end if it develops into chronic pain that’s debilitating. There are official workplace protocols that may need to be followed when operating heavy machinery or hazardous chemicals. Make sure you completely understand the proper procedures and follow them exactly as stated. Especially when dealing with something for the first time, you not only want to avoid injury to yourself but you also want to avoid damage to your client's property.

, If you’re working on your own, you may need to learn marketing strategies, targeted advertising, cash flow administration, and budgeting software. You may be able to hire a staff immediately or outsource things like accounting if you have the initial capital to cover these costs. Don’t be afraid to take classes or hire a consultant as the initial expenditure will be worth the investment.While trial and error can work, you don’t want to waste valuable time and resources especially when working in a competitive market.

, There are many different clients who seek landscapers and lawn care professionals. A startup landscaping business can typically have between 20 to 30 residential clients a week. These clients may receive anything from fertilizing, chemical application, and landscape installation, to mowing and lawn maintenance.Potential landscaping clients will include: homeowners who want you to design their landscaping because they don’t have the tools or creativity that you possess, new homeowners who want to update their landscape, homeowners who are looking to sell and want to enhance their home’s curb appeal, both residential and commercial builders without an in-house landscaping team.
Potential lawn care clients include: homeowners who travel frequently, retirees who don’t have the capacity to care for their lawn themselves, “snowbirds” who leave for warmer climates during the cold months, golf course managers, rental property or condominium association managers who need property upkeep, and facilities managers of public green spaces. Public green spaces include cemeteries, universities, government entities, and universities.

, You may offer a variety of services but be sure that you have enough resources to cover everything you offer. For example, if you offer pest control, you may need special certification for animal handling. This certification will require additional training and you may not have the money and time to cover it.Services may include: lawn maintenance/mowing, hydroseeding, sod installation, landscape care, weeding, fertilizing, landscape maintenance, pest control, landscape design, landscape architecture, or contracting services. Most begin with mowing and begin to add other services as they gain more experience.

, Come up with an hourly rate for both you and your employees to establish a baseline for your services. This will not be shared to your clients but will help you give your estimates for any requested service.You may ask friends and family to contact competitors to see how much they offer their services for and then set your prices to compete. You may also figure out how much it would cost you to complete a project and then divide the price of the materials with the amount of hours it would take you to complete the project.
You may also figure out your rates based on how much you want to make in a year. For example, if you want to make $40,000 to start, this will roughly be $3,334 a month. Next, divide that by the number of hours you want to work in a month. So if your want to work 35 hours a week in a four week month you would be working 140 hours with a rate of $23.81/hour. You can add a profit margin. The cost of doing business, including tools, administrations, and materials, is billed to your clients on top of your hourly rate.
Your rate must, at the very least, cover the bills of your business and personal expenses including food, mortgage, medication, etc. This will allow you to survive but will not give you any profit for savings or investing back into your business.

, Clients will want to know the upfront cost of your service. There are software packages including CLIP and LandPro that can help you with this tricky proposition. You don’t want to give an estimate that’s too high that it seems unreasonable, or too low that it makes the project seem like a waste of your time and resources.You must determine what your costs will be including material and labour. Then you can add your profit margin after you have covered the resources. Materials may include topsoil, mulch, and plants. You may be able to find these at wholesalers that will give you greater value. You can then mark up the price to gain a profit. You may also work with subcontractors and rent equipment if it allows you to work with more clients and offer different services. Keep in mind business overhead as well. For example, take into account the cost of gas as you must drive from location to location.
Your estimate includes the exact services that you will be providing, the materials needed, and any other details specific to the project. It is the landscaping industry standard to provide an estimate as a free service.

, Instead of collecting the grass clippings in a regular bag, you can leave it on the lawn for microbes and earthworms to eat. This can help keep your lawn healthy and green. You can also collect the clippings and place them into compost.Rake up a light layer of leaves and go over them with your lawn mower. Leave the discards on your lawn to limit popping up weeds as the leaves break down.

, Take different perspectives to view your landscape. After you view your landscape from the street you should also view it from inside the home to make sure it looks well groomed from multiple angles. You should also view it from rooms with large windows that look out to it., Allow your plants and flowers to have adequate space to grow and flourish. Don’t try to cram every inch of your landscape because you will find it extremely difficult to prune and weed next spring., Red mulch has been found to have harsh chemicals, including arsenic that is harmful to pets and children. Don’t let harsh chemicals contaminate your soil. Read labels and choose organic or natural fertilizers., Local agricultural agencies are able to test your soil to see what nutrients it needs if you send a sample to them. Collect two cups of soil in a sample bag by digging about six to seven inches deep into the soil. Research your closest agricultural agency and send your sample.There will be a charge to send the sample. Be sure to contact them before hand to ensure you know the proper procedures and wait time.

, If there is a particular flower that you like you should buy several and plant them in groupings. You may plant them in clumps of five or seven in one area, or create a unified look by planting these odd numbered clumps throughout your landscape., Don’t make your planting beds too narrow. Make sure not to place them too close to the house by placing them around a third to two thirds the height of the house., Weed fabric can be a waste of time and money because weeds will continue to grow on top of it in the long term. No matter how many layers of weed fabric you lay down you will still have weeds grow in the long term, so don’t waste your resources., Avoid using lawn fertilizers that have 30 percent nitrogen. Use time-releasing water-insoluble nitrogen only twice a year. Your lawn will need less fertilizer if it is older and well-irrigated.For example, only use fertilizer on Memorial Day and after Labor Day.

, Do your research and make sure not to include any invasive species in your garden. Talk to nurseries and research online to be sure that you don’t include any species that will spread and kill other plants.For example, nurseries still sell purple loosestrife. It is inexpensive and produces a lovely flower but will spread and choke out your other plants.

, Water your lawn with one inch of water every week. Depending on your soil and the heat, you may need to water your lawn once every five days. Create a stronger plant with infrequent watering that forces the roots to grow deeper to find ground water.Remember to check water restrictions during extreme heat.

, Use a colour wheel to determine opposite colours. Choose what colours work best together and find the flowers that match.For example, purple and yellow work well together.

Put in a good floor.,
Build wide center aisles and stalls.,
Provide plenty of air and light.,
Have adequate access to water and electricity.,
Provide adequate cleaning stations.,
Keep tack and feed rooms separate.,
Use the right doors.,
Provide rooms for your own convenience, too.",How to Build a Barn2," Place the task rooms so that the tasks you do the most are clustered together and those you do least are furthest away. Clustering animal stalls together also makes it easier to clean the stalls and dispose of the manure in an efficient manner.


If you have a large number of animal stalls, cluster them around the tack and feed rooms.

, Using slab concrete for the base floor provides a smooth surface for doorways and makes sweeping easier, while making it harder for animals to dig under stall partitions. However, concrete can be hard on animal hooves, so it should be covered with asphalt or rubber pavers on the center aisle and layers of gravel and clay in animal stalls.

, At a minimum, center aisles should be 12 feet (3.7 meters) wide, although 14-foot (4.2-meter) wide center aisles allow added room for moving animals and equipment. Stalls should be at least 12 feet square, and preferably 14 feet square, with the rafters at least 10 feet (3 meters) off the floor to give animals adequate room to exercise without walking in their own excrement.

, Good air flow keeps farm animals healthy, while good lighting discourages flies from congregating and makes the barn a better place for people to work in. Build your barn with adequate vent windows, placed out of the animals' reach, and add 1 or 2 exhaust fans to help move the air. Supplement the light from the windows with individual stall lights and rows of fluorescent lights in the center aisle.

, Ideally, light switches, electric outlets and water spigots should be clustered between each pair of stalls, allowing you to fill water buckets conveniently and not need to use extension cords.


You should have at least one 220-volt outlet in addition to 110-volt outlets, for such things as hot-water heaters, clothes dryers or other specialized equipment requiring them.

, An outdoor wash stall needs little more than an enclosure and running water to clean animals, while an indoor cleaning stall can be set up to clean yourself, your boots and animal equipment as well as the animals themselves, along with storage cabinets to provide ready access to animal brushes and cleaning gear.

, Keeping tack and feed rooms separate keeps the tack from being covered with feed dust. It also allows for putting storage cabinets in each room to hold related items.


You can also put a small refrigerator in the tack room to store animal medications that require refrigeration, as well as a sink for mixing those medications.
The feed room should have a week's worth of grain and a day's worth of hay, with the rest stored in a separate building. (Storing more hay than that in the barn may raise your fire insurance premium; some insurers won't cover barns used to store hay.)

, For the main barn doors, paired sliding doors that open the width of the center aisle will last longer without sagging, while admitting light even when closed. (If the barn is being built in areas where flies are a problem, hinged screen doors inside will help keep the flies out.) Stall doors should be hinged, and feature wooden lower sections and ventilation bars above.

, A separate utility room to store stall cleaning tools will help keep the tack and feed rooms cleaner, while a restroom will save you and your farmhand the trouble of running back to the house and tracking mud there if you need to go while working in the barn.

Place the rock in the hole.",How to Make Fake Rocks with Concrete," You can use a variety of materials to create the shape of your rock. There are several common items you can choose from:


Styrofoam
Cardboard
Crumpled newspaper;
, Cut the cardboard or styrofoam to the shape you want your rock to be. Combine different materials with glue to create oddly shaped rocks.


Use a plain cardboard box for a roughly square shaped rock.
A hot wire foam cutter works well to shape styrofoam.

, Use a metal mesh to wrap the rock shape. The metal gives strength to your artificial rock and provides a structure for the cement mortar mix to adhere to.Use wire twist ties to secure the wire frame to your rock base.

, To make the most natural looking rock, bend and shape the wire form around your rock shape. Natural rocks have dips and creases; simulate these shapes by pushing your wire form in various places to create uneven surfaces.

, Mix 3 parts sand with 1 part portland cement. Add all the ingredients to a wheelbarrow or concrete mixer, depending on the size of rock you are creating and amount of mortar you are mixing.


You can reduce the sand, and add 1 part peat moss to create a more porous artificial rock.If you want to use the fake rocks in an area exposed to water, use a hydraulic cement mix instead.

, Slowly add 1 part water to the dry mixture; you may need to add more or less water depending on humidity and temperature. The mixture will turn into a thick paste as you add the water.


Stir the water into the mortar mix as you add it.
Watch closely as you add the water so your mixture does not get too wet.

, For small amounts, turn the mixture over in the wheelbarrow repeatedly, or stir with a paddle attached to an electric drill. For larger amounts, use a concrete mixer. You will need to mix the mortar to the consistency of cookie dough.Ensure the mixture is fully mixed and uniformly wet.
Add more water if necessary to get the consistency of a thick paste. You do not want the mixture to be runny.
Unmixed blobs of sand will cause weak spots in the finished rock; be sure to mix everything completely.
Keep track of what you added and adjust until you reach the desired consistency. Write down the formula you find that works best. Follow this formula and use the same measuring device for the water each time to keep a consistent mix from batch to batch.

, Use a flat pointed trowel to apply a 2-3"" layer of mortar to the wire frame.Build the rock from the bottom up.






Make a layer of mortar around the base of the rock and work upwards around the wire frame.

, Create a realistic looking rock by adding contours and patterns to the surface of the mortar.


Use your trowel to create dips and creases in the surface of the mortar.
Press a real rock into the mortar to make imprints of the rock's texture.
Press a sea sponge or scouring pad into the rock to create pock marked look.
Wrap a plastic bag around your hand and press it into the mortar to give a wrinkled look.

, The curing process is a result of a chemical reaction, not the cement drying out. Although 75% of the curing is completed after one week, it may take up to a month for cement to cure completely.


Mist the surface of the rock every few days as it cures.
Keep the cement out of direct sunlight to prevent cracks.
Cover the rock with plastic sheeting as it cures.

, Use a scraping stone or a hard wire bristle brush to rub the surface of the rock. Scrape off any sharp or pointy edges that exist on surface of the rock.


Allow the rock to cure for a week prior to scraping to prevent crumbling.

, Thoroughly rinse the surface of the rock. Brush the surface with a wire brush while washing to remove any loose bits of mortar. Make sure to flush out any creases or dips in the rock to get rid of rock dust.

, Use a penetrating concrete stain to cover the surface of the rock in the color of your choice. You can apply multiple colors to provide the most natural look. For a more obvious design element, shiny aggregates or even glow in the dark powders are also available to add to the mix.


Brush the stain on rock with a paint brush.
Add depth to the coloring by using more than one color.
Apply more stain in some areas for darker contrasts.

, Use a water or solvent based concrete sealer to protect your artificial rock from the elements. Some sealants provide a glossy finish while others have no sheen but still provided protection.


Brush on 3 coats of sealant. Wait about 15 minutes between coats.
Maintain the sealant by reapplying a coat of sealant every 1-2 years.

, Decide which side is the bottom of the rock, and cut it open so you can remove the inner structure. The rock's shape and strength come from the mortar and wire frame; the inner materials do not provide structure after the concrete has cured. Removing them will prevent them from decomposing.

, Fake rocks can be used as a part of a water feature, lining pathways, or as garden accents. Determine the best place for your rock based on its size and appearance.


Unless you used hydraulic cement mix, keep the fake rocks away from water. Standing in water or heavy water splashing can cause regular cement to break down.

, Place the rock in place and trace the edge of the rock with a stick or shovel. Dig a 1-2” pit in the shape of the rock. Placing the edges of the rock underground will provide a more natural look of a rock outcropping.

, Push dirt and other small rocks against the edge of the rock to integrate it with the landscape. Build multiple rocks to create elaborate rock landscapes.

Install spotlights to dramatize large, dense tree foliage.,
Use a closely spaced spotlight to accent a tree's form.,
Light narrow trees from directly underneath.,
Position lighting within the tree's foliage for elegant down-lighting.,
Create dramatic silhouettes by lighting trees against walls.",How to Accent Trees With Outdoor Lighting," To highlight a tree that has a large amount of dense foliage, you can use above-ground spotlights. Position the spotlight (you can use 1 or several) a good distance away from the tree's trunk and aim it upwards towards the foliage. This will create a dramatic, looming effect that accents the tree's size and grandeur.;
, Another technique that allows you to highlight a tree with large, bushy foliage is to position the spotlight very close to the trunk and aim it almost vertically. This effect, rather than dramatizing the foliage, highlights the texture and form of the tree's trunk and branches. Use this technique when you want to accent a tree with an interesting trunk shape.

, Small, spindly, or narrow trees will often not appear as dramatic when lighted using the above spotlight technique. Instead, use in-ground lights positioned directly by the tree's trunk and facing upwards. This technique gives small trees like palms a dramatic impact that belies their diminutive size.

, If you have a tree with lots of loose foliage, consider placing a spotlight facing downwards directly onto one of the tree's branches. This will cast enchanting shadows of the tree's foliage onto the surrounding ground, creating an elegant moonlit effect.

, If you have a tree that is placed near the wall of your home, try placing a bright spotlight in front of it and aiming it towards the wall. This will cast a dramatic shadow of the tree's form onto the wall. This technique is especially suited for trees with interesting shapes as well as shrubs and topiary.


Because this technique provides a wash of light over the wall of your house, it also contributes to the increased security of your home.
If lit from below, trees will cast a dramatic shadow up onto the wall that appears larger than the plant's actual size. For a more subtle effect, try lighting from above or using multiple lights to soften the individual shadows.

You can actually create a playground for children with just a few easy tweaks. You can make use of old chairs or tires and turn them into swings. You just have to make sure that you use sturdy ropes as well as tie them appropriately to a tree for safety.
, If you would want to have a dramatic effect on your yard, you can place some lights and just activate them if you have visitors. However, a saving tip would be to make use of solar lights. Rather than using ordinary light bulbs, consider these excellent alternatives since they are regarded as inviting yet cheaper than the traditional light bulbs., You can make use of old wine or soft drink bottles as decorations. How? You just hand them to your fences and put flowers or plants in them. Ensure that you use colorful flowers to make them more appealing. Apart from that, you can likewise use these bottles as torches – they are indeed quite handy at night., When you do not own a swimming pool and that you do not have sufficient budget for its construction, you can be creative by constructing water bed slides with plastics or perhaps even tarp. But in case you have extra money, you can purchase splash pads. They will certainly be a great addition to your property. Most importantly, children will certainly have fun on it., If you have a tree stump in the middle of your yard, you need not to be worried about it as a hindrance to your backyard party. You can actually make it to your advantage. You can use the tree stump as legs and turn it into a table. Apart from that, you can decorate it with old fabrics or perhaps flowers to make it more appealing."

Make sure your entrance is accessible.,
Have a clear access path to the door.,
Make sure the entrance is well lit.,
Add decorative features on the walkway or near the entrance.,
Have a nice front door.,
At the front door, add features to make it look like a home.,
Make the front entrance a living space.",How to Make Your House Look Welcoming from the Outside," That means cleaning up the front yard, porch and entrance-way to allow visitors to get to the front door without stepping through or over obstacles. On the actual porch, clear away boxes, boots and shoes and anything else that doesn't belong there (these sorts of things can go at the back or family entrance).


Clean up the walk from the street, sidewalk, or driveway. Remove brush, thorny plants, overhanging branches, toys, or other hazards.
Make sure the walkway path itself is usable. Try to have cement, flagstones, gravel, or even a wooden walkway so people aren't stepping in water, snow or mud.;
, When visitors approach from the street, drive or other public area, can they see which way to walk? They must be able to open the gate, for example. An archway, trellis, or other landscape feature is a good way to announce the entrance.

, This means from the initial road entry through to the front door––anyone entering should be able to see their way clearly, both in dim light and dark night. To improve poor visibility, replace any broken or dim bulbs and clean and polish the light fixtures. You might even consider adding new light fixtures to improve both visibility and appearance.


Porch areas need at least 60- to 75-watt globes. Lower wattage will be too dim.
Garden lights can be used to line a pathway or steer visitors off your lawn and toward the entry.


, These could include potted plants, benches, paving stones, planter boxes, signs, statuary, bird baths, fountains, flowers, artwork, or decorative plants.


Even a simple straight path from the street can be made more interesting with cheap, used or free items. Visit yard sales or flea markets and see if you can find anything colorful that can sit in the outdoor weather and attract the eye.

, This could be as simple as giving it a good scrub and wash down. Or, if it has faded over the years, repaint it to a vibrant new color. Almost anyone can paint a door if they are willing to try! If the door is in really poor condition, it might be time to replace it completely, both for the sake of your sense of security and for improving the appearance of the front of your house.


Oil any squeaky hinges and polish up any metalwork on the door, such as brass numbers.
Don't forget the molding and framework around the door. If it's flaking, then it needs repainting too.
Check the floor beneath the door. If it is chipped, dowdy, dull, then clean it and polish. You might need to paint, varnish or redo the floor, depending on its make and style. Don't neglect this aspect, as it adds to the overall impression.

, You might have a small chair and table, a bowl of rocks or shells, a potted plant, a sign, a place for shoes or boots, an umbrella stand, hooks for hats or wet clothes, a brush for muddy shoes, a bin for walking sticks or canes, or some shade for hot days.


A decent, pretty doormat should be both functional and welcoming. Remove tatty doormats and either spruce them up or buy a new one. The doormat doesn't have to spell out welcome in letters (although some do), but it must make the visitor feel welcome.
Chairs or seats at the front door can become dull and discolored over time. If you have these, check that the condition of the wood or other material is good; if not, clean it up and redecorate it to look like new. And replace worn and faded cushions to make it all feel better again.

, If the front door is a place to sit and visit, to meet and greet visitors, to live in, it will definitely be more welcoming. Putting some chairs nearby in a conversational circle would be one way. Or just inside the door, make a space for visitors to transition into the house, with other chairs or benches to change clothes or shoes, to hang coats, set bags down, even to stop and admire a piece of art, a plant, or other decorative feature.


Don't allow obstacles at the front door. Don't make visitors step over a pile of shoes, the family dog, children's toys, or other things on the floor to get inside. This isn't welcoming.

,


Put on a paper mask to protect yourself from the fine dust that is released during the dis-assembly process.
Use the single edge razor to speed up the dismantling of the old chair. Make quick strokes across the threads, not worrying too much about ruining the old material which will be thrown away, then pull the pieces apart.
Again, take images whenever you come to a section where two pieces are connected, or wherever there is a complicated seam; this way you will know exactly how to re-sew the new fabric.

, This is so you don't have to sew into the very strong reinforcing ring material, especially if your sewing machine can't handle it.


Be sure to make your pattern piece to incorporate these sections.
Retain any of the old packing foam or other unusual parts needed later for re-assembly.

, Once everything is dismantled, take one of each unique piece and trace it on the brown packing paper:


Poke holes in the paper wherever you may need to make guidelines later.
If you are sewing without double fold bias tape, as shown in these images, then you will need to add the appropriate extra ""folded-edging allowance"" on to your pattern. In the project shown here, that meant 1 centimeter (0.4 in) folded either two or three times, equaling 2-3 additional centimetres being added to each pattern piece.

, You will need to note:


Which direction is the front, back and top;
The number of the piece you will need to cut out; and
Which other pieces connect to each side of the piece.

, It is important to make sure that you plan which way the fabric's nap or material print direction will run for each piece you plan to cut out. For instance, the example shown first appeared to have no noticeable print or nap direction, however, when the fabric was turned at 90 degrees, the optical sheen changed from a warm tone to a cool tone.


Try to picture in your mind which way you will be viewing each piece of the pattern piece before laying them out and cutting them.

, Basting and pinning each section is the best way to avoid fighting with holding pins or ending up with visibly uneven seems.


The contrasting colour of the thread will make it easier to pull it out afterward
Follow the photos that you took initially to know where to sew the pieces together.
A finished corner.

, Sewing will be slow with this project. Work your sewing machine by slowing turning the hand wheel by hand and giving just enough power to move over these sections very slowly. The upholstery thread is very thick, so to make things go faster, fill up several sewing machine bobbins with your upholstery thread, so you do not constantly have to un-thread and refill the same bobbin.


Increased thickness of fabric, at corners or fold seams, requires that you wear your safety goggles while stitching.

, Once everything is sewn then simply reassemble to the original metal frame. In this example, there were screws holding the armrests and top back sections to the metal frame:


Assemble all the pieces out on the floor to check that you have sewn together everything. If anything is missing at this stage, be sure to make it!
Slip the pieces back on in the order required. This means that pieces that serve as the base or foundation will need to be in place first, then pieces that slip over the top are fed back into place next. The order will depend on the style of the chair.
Screw the fabric pieces back into place securely.

Select pavers that mesh well with the color of your home.,
Use pavers as a new color pallette.",How to Choose Pavers," As you create your budget, call around to identify the price of parts and labor. Purchasing pavers and labor together will make the process faster, but is not a necessary step in the process. To keep costs down, you can purchase pavers on your own, and pay for labor separately.Don’t be afraid to haggle! Prices are rarely set in stone.
Concrete pavers are usually cheapest, while brick and stone cost more.
To get the most for your buck, try to find discontinued pavers. These are usually marked down to a significant degree and are wonderful for a small budget.;
, Brick is a porous substance, and may break down more quickly than concrete in areas with a lot of rain, heat, or wind. If you live in a moderate climate, however, brick is likely to weather well. Concrete and stone hold up better in harsh climates.If you live in a harsh climate but love the look of brick or limestone, go for it! You may simply need to work paver replacements into your yearly house budget.

, If your paving space is exposed to sun or weather, you will need to use a strong material, such as stone or concrete. The sun is powerful and can cause premature wearing on all types of pavers, but will quickly degrade delicate material such as limestone., If the area you are hoping to pave is covered, your paving material will not need to be as hardy.

If you are worried about sun exposure (when living in a desert climate, for instance), you may want to roll the price of a canopy or other sun shade into your budget

, Before committing to a paver choice, take the other materials in the area into account. Wood, for instance, is extremely versatile and works well with virtually everything. On the other end of the spectrum, metal is better suited for concrete or stone. Your existing outdoor furniture will also come into play when deciding how you want your space to look.Metal and concrete lend themselves to an industrial look, while wood and brick are more cozy.

, Concrete offers an abundance of options in terms of both shape and color, and is going to be the best choice if you’d like the freedom to choose a wide host of colors or shapes. Conversely, brick is a classic look, but is limited in both color and shape, and is typically only found in red, black, and gray blocks., The width of your space will help you determine what types of paver shapes will work well in your yard. A narrow yard, for instance, is not going to do well with wide pavers, as it will create the illusion of an even smaller space. A large yard may not do well with small shapes and patterns, as putting them in will be both labor and time intensive.If you have a large space, you can ease some of the financial burden by spacing your pavers and placing gravel or wood chips between them. The result is polished, but not quite as expensive.

, Look at your yard and home. If you favor rounded shapes, you may want to use circles, spirals, or scalloped edges in your yard. If you tend to gravitate toward angular shapes, simple brick pavers will work well with your space, as will octagons and pentagons.Your space does not have to match. If you like a more chaotic, free-spirited look, you can mix and match rounded and sharp edges.

, The more elaborate the shape is, the more expensive the pavers are likely to be. Before deciding on brightly-hued spiral pavers, check in with your budget. Make sure you can afford the cost of parts and labor for the initial install and replacements in the future.If your budget does not allow for your ideal pavers, try to find used or leftover pavers on sites such as Craigslist or at yard sales. This can be especially useful if you are paving a smaller area.

, The sun exposure in your yard must be factored in before making a decision about color. High sun exposure will not only break down materials, but will cause color fading over time, making once-vibrant hues dull. If your home has a lot of sun exposure, opt for neutral or natural tones, instead.The staining process can also be taken into account. If your pavers are dyed concrete, fading will be difficult to coer. If your pavers are painted or coated, replacing color may be easy.

, Your home’s color should also play a role in your decision regarding your pavers’ color. If your home is a neutral color such as white or beige, most paver colors will work well. If your home is a more distinct color, such as forest green or a deep gray, you will need to be more selective with your pavers.You can also use multiple paver colors to tie in your home color and your vision for your paved space.

, If you cannot find a color scheme you like that works with both your pavers and your existing home and yard colors, use your pavers as the template for a rehaul of your home. This will allow you to experiment with colors and shapes without worrying about your existing decorations."

Make a plan.,
Check with your local utilities company before starting any construction.,

Seal your pavers.",How to Install Pavers," A good plan is essential to a successful paver project. Think about where you want your path, driveway, or patio, and then use graph paper to make a scaled drawing of the immediate area. Draw in your paver project. You'll have to play around with your design a bit, so be sure to use pencil and keep your drawing neat. Your project will need to have adequate drainage if you want it to be safe and durable. You'll also want to make sure that it slopes away from your house and other structures. To ensure adequate drainage, you should have a slope of at least 1/8"" per linear foot (1/4"" slope per linear foot is often recommended).






;
, Installing pavers may be easy, but it's necessary to check with your local utilities company before beginning to ensure that you don't accidentally strike or obtrude any cables or pipes. You can do this by calling 811, also known as the Digline.When you call, you can request to have your local utility companies come to your site and mark the areas where there are pipes and wires.








, You have a lot of choices in the pavers you use. Most are brick or concrete, but you can find a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors. Find a style that is to your liking and that fits your budget either online or at your local builders supply store.









In general, if your project area isn't too irregularly shaped, you can safely calculate how many pavers you need by simply measuring the square footage of the footprint and adding 5%. If your design has a lot of curves, get an extra 10% over your best square footage estimate.
You should order a bit extra because you'll almost certainly end up having to cut some of the pavers to get the right fit. The fancier your outline, the more pavers you'll have to cut.

Keep in mind that pavers are extremely heavy. It is best to have them delivered for this reason. There may be a pallet fee as well.

, White marking paint works well and helps the locate service see exactly where the work area. Another option is to outline the project area. You can use string or garden hose to outline your project. Drive stakes to hold the outline in place and use a triangle to make clean corners.









, To avoid water pooling on your pavers, you want your pavers to be slightly above the surface of the surrounding ground at all points. Thus, when planning the slope, begin with what will be the highest point. Typically, this is the point at the bottom of the front door or otherwise closest to the house.









Drive a stake at the high point, and mark the correct height where the pavers will meet the door or structure. Tie a string around the stake at that height.
Drive a stake (if there isn't already one) at the outer boundary of your project. This will be your lowest point. Attach a line level to your string and then tie the loose end of the string around the outer stake at the height at which the line level tells you the entire string is level. Now from that line move down the stake at least 1/8"" per linear foot (e.g. if it is 8 feet from your front door to the outer edge of your patio, move down the stake 1""), and draw a new line. Move your string down to this line. String cross-lines down the length of the project to ensure you mark the correct depth across the entire project.
If your project area has a variety of slopes, or if your design is irregular, you'll need to repeat this process in several points. It is absolutely critical that you get the slope right, so the more stakes, the better.
You may want to consider hiring someone who know how to use a transit or laser level and measuring rod. They can achieve the same results in less time.
Make sure to remove the string before you start digging, or you may end up tripping on it.

, Spaces which will be exposed only to foot traffic generally need 4-6"" of base material, while driveways or projects in very wet soil may need as much as 12"" of base. Figure out how deep your base will need to be (consult the manufacturer or your building supply store), and add about 1-1.5"" for the sand layer, plus the thickness of the pavers (this varies by brand and style but is typically 2 3/8"" or 3 1/8""). The sum of the depth of the base, the sand, and the pavers will be how deep you need to excavate your project area. Be sure to excavate 6-12"" beyond the boundaries of the project to give you ample space to install your edge restraints. This is important.









Also, try to level and smooth out the soil where the paver edging will go. You can also spread the base material a little past where the edging will be and then flatten it out using a compactor or hand tamping tool. Then, install the edging firmly.

Measure the depth of your excavation from the string you used to track your slope, not from the surface of the ground.

, Base material is usually coarse, crushed stone with sharp irregular edges. The two most important things about base material is that it remains strong when compacted (to serve as a base for your pavers) and that it drains properly. Poor structural integrity and poor drainage can ruin an otherwise perfect paving project.









, Add no more than 6 inches (15.2 cm) at a time to the entire excavated area, and then compact with a hand tamper (for very small projects) or a mechanical plate compactor. It's essential that the base be well-compacted. Repeat this process until you have a base of the correct depth. Now is your last chance to properly adjust the height of the finished project and to ensure you don't have any dips or bumps. Slightly increase or decrease the thickness of the base as necessary, taking frequent measurements from your strings to the base.









Be sure to lay base material beyond the planned boundaries of the pavers. Laying the base outside the boundaries of the pavers will make your project more stable.
Continue adding base material and then compacting every 2 inches (5.1 cm) until you are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from your desired finish height. When compacting, be sure to maintain a gentle slope — usually away from your house.


, Edge restraints will help hold the shape of your project over the years. Place these restraints, usually made of plastic, aluminum, or steel, around the perimeter of the project and secure them into the ground with 12"" spikes. If your design is irregularly shaped, you'll need to cut the restraints in order to follow the edges of your design.









, The sand is the material that holds your pavers in place. Use coarse sand and screed it smooth to a uniform depth of at least 1 inch (2.5 cm), but no more that 1 1/2 inches (5.1 cm). If your project is large, lay down 1"" screed pipes and then pour the sand in between the pipes, screeding the sand in small sections (50-100 square feet each). Remove the pipes and then fill in the gaps with more sand.









Check to see if a weed barrier or weed blocker fabric will be used first. Most often these materials are placed on the soil before the base goes down.

, Luckily, laying pavers is easy compared to all the work you've just done. Begin laying pavers at a 90-degree corner, preferably one that abuts the house or another structure, and continue extending the pavers along the longest straight side. Be sure to pull from several pallets of product in order to have a good blend of the colors. Pavers are made from natural materials that can cause slight changes to the appearance of the colored pavers. Working from several pallets will help to blend these slight differences into the surface. Work out from there, keeping your pavers in straight lines. Lay pavers by placing them straight down in the sand --do not slide them along the ground or kick them into place and disturb the sand. Slide each paver straight down the edge of the adjacent paver. Keep the pavers as close together as possible. If there are wide gaps between the pavers, then you will need much more polymeric sand to fill the gaps. Periodically check to make sure the pavers are flat, using a string or a level to check each row for straightness.








Use a level on top of the pavers often to make sure the correct slope and level is maintained from row to row.

Do not walk on your prepared sand. Stand on the pavers you have already installed and work your way out. Don't get too close to the edge of the pavers you've installed, or you might disturb the sand in front of them.


, You'll almost invariably need to cut some pavers to fit the edges. Don't try to curve your pavers to fit the edging. Instead, lay all the whole pavers you can in each row and then go back and cut pavers to the correct sizes to fit the edge. Use a masonry saw (wet saw that you can rent from a local tool rental company) or a guillotine-style splitter to make good, clean cuts. If you gave yourself plenty of pavers to work with in the beginning, you should have more than enough materials to accommodate even a few mistakes!









, Once the pavers are all placed according to pattern, use a plate compactor to tamp the pavers into the sand. Once all the pavers are installed, run the plate compactor over them at least three times to ensure they are snugly pressed into the sand.









If there are any gaps between the pavers, then you can sweep polymeric sand into all the joints until they are about half full. This will keep the pavers from shifting during plate compaction. If the pavers are loose when you are compacting them, then they may become uneven.
When you are compacting the material and pavers, always try to go in different directions or patterns.
Be sure to use a protective covering, such as a heavy gunnysack, over your plate compactor when you compress the pavers in order to avoid scuffing.

, Fill the joints between pavers with coarse sand like you used earlier, or use slightly finer sand, such as bagged silica (available at paver outlets). Pour it onto the pavers and sweep it into the cracks until they are completely filled. This sand ""locks"" the pavers in place. Make sure the sand is dry.









Use a large push broom for a large area, or a small push broom for a small area. Sweep in many different directions.

, For added durability and lower maintenance, seal the pavers with an appropriate sealing product. Look for a non-toxic (vegetative safe) paver sealer, and don't forget to clean the pavers beforehand.










Don’t use too much water when cleaning the pavers and make sure that they are completely dry before applying the sealant.

Before you start digging the path, be sure there are no utilities or irrigation lines in the area where you are putting your path.,

Once the area is excavated, be sure the soil below is slightly damp and compact the soil using a heavy flat object or the plate compactor.,
Place at least two pipes directly on the compacted soil.,
Place a border course of pavers around the entire edge, then place the rest in the desired pattern.,
Compact the pavers using something heavy and flat.,
Spread dry joint sand over the surface and sweep some into the joints.",How to Build a Small Garden Path," If you are making a winding path, a garden hose makes a nice flexible line, but you can also use spray paint directly on the ground or stakes and string.;
, Determine how much material you will need. One way, if you use found materials like rocks, simply keep collecting it and laying it out on the proposed path until you have enough. If you are buying pavers, the home and garden shop has calculators for figuring the number you need. Always figure a minimum of 10% waste when ordering the pavers. A bag of sand from the home improvement store contains 6-7 square feet of sand 1-inch thick. (Read the label!) Divide your square footage by 6 or 7 to find the number of bags. If you need it in tons, ask the distributor to figure it for you, keeping in mind that your sand bed is 1” thick by the square footage of your path. However you buy sand, add extra for leveling the path and filling between the stones. Mortar sand, which is finer grained than all purpose sand, is good for filling joints, especially tight ones.

, Be sure to call the “Call Before You Dig” number from your local utility company especially if you are adding a compacted base and will be digging quite a way into the dirt. You will have to locate your own irrigation lines.

, Keep in mind the thickness of the paving material you are using when determining the depth to which you have to dig. You will need 1-inch for the sand bed plus the thickness of the paver. If you are using a compacted base, don't forget to add that in. You will need 1 in. thick sand +~2 3/8 in. thick pavers =~3 in. depth for excavation since there will be slight settlement of the sand when the pavers are compacted into it. Be sure to get rid of the excavated soil etc. so that the ground will drain correctly. Don't pile it up around the path.

, Check the slope if you are putting your path directly against your house to be sure water will drain away from the foundation. For every foot, there should be a 1/4 in. drop. Adjust slope as needed.

, Place them apart and parallel to each other. Spread moist but not saturated sand between the pipes. Use a shovel and rake to smooth out. Pull the straight piece of wood across the pipes several times until sand is perfectly smooth. Do this for the entire area. Remove the pipes and fill the indentations with sand. Level these areas with a square trowel. Don't walk on or disturb the leveled sand.

, Continue to place pavers on the sand, but don't drag them into the sand. Use the other pavers on the sand as means to locate the one you're placing. Cut pavers as needed.

, (a plate compactor should definitely be used for large surfaces to be sure that you don't end up with tripping hazards.) Jumping up and down on the pavers until they are level works fine in small areas. Make at least four passes over all the pavers, starting at the outside of the pavement and working around the edges toward the inside. Then compact back and forth like mowing the grass. If you want to, you can remove and replace any pavers that crack or chip. Adjust joints. A large screwdriver is good for aligning paver joints.

, Vibrate and compact the sand into the joints, sweeping and compacting as you go. Filling the joints with sand will take several passes. After compaction, the sand in the joints might settle, especially after a few rainstorms. Apply some extra sand to fill these joints as needed. Remove excess sand by sweeping. Apply a sealer if you want.

",How to Install Tactile Pavers," Tactile pavers come in sizes and shapes similar to patio type pavers, in varying shapes and sizes. For a public facility in the United States, your selection will need to meet ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements, and a specification should be provided by the civil engineer or architect who is responsible for the project design.;
, Since the pavers are embedded or surrounded by a concrete curb, you will want to make a recessed block-out in your sidewalk for them to set in. Here are the points you will want to consider when doing this.


Size the blocked out area so an equal number of pavers will fit, without requiring border cuts. Typical pavers are cast with an eight thousand PSI concrete mix, and cutting them can be time consuming and difficult. Measuring the actual size of the pavers and dividing the overall size of the paver bed, then adjusting the dimensions will make it possible to fill the space within reasonable tolerances without cutting any border pavers.






Measure the thickness of your pavers, then make the recess concrete block out about one to one and one half inches deeper than this thickness, to allow for a setting bed of compacted sand.






Make sure the border curb that surrounds the paver bed meets the construction requirements of your job, if applicable. Usually, the pavers will be immediately adjacent to a street, so you may expect vehicles to occasionally drift onto the curb. For this reason, the border curb should be structurally constructed to support these errant vehicles. Typically, forming the concrete 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide and 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) deep, and adding reinforcing bars will support this traffic load.







, Be careful to have all form surfaces on a flat (not necessarily level, as the sidewalk approach to a street is often sloped) plane. This will enable you to keep the pavers flush with the concrete surface when they are laid in. Place and finish the concrete.

, Take care not to damage the edges of the concrete, so the joint between concrete and pavers is clean and neat.

, You may use crushed limestone or fine gravel, or set the pavers in a bed of masonry cement mortar, but the pavers in the example pictures are laid in clean sand. This is the manufacturer's suggested setting technique for these particular pavers.

, Here, an actual paver is used to establish the depth of the setting sand. You may also make a gauge block or measure down from the surface of the walkway with a ruler or tape measure to get the desired results.

, Damp sand is especially suited for this purpose, since it compacts to a good, solid density easily.

, This should lay down any humps (high spots), and some more sand can be placed in the low spots and repacked.

, Stack them with the dimpled side up, close enough to be within easy reach of the place they are to be laid. This will usually mean stacking them in groups of ten or fifteen, around the perimeter of the blocked out, recessed area.

, Here, a two by two cross hatched pattern is used. This is the simplest pattern, resulting in few, if any cuts. Hound's Tooth is another pattern, as is a simple diagonal and staggered design, but these will require half cuts around the border to complete.

, Make sure the joints remain tight, and square, since the interaction between the individual pavers keeps them from working or shifting around after they are set.

, Because it is necessary to allow some space for fitting the pavers, you should end up with about a 1⁄4 to 3⁄8 inch (0.6 to 1.0 cm) outside joint around the pavers. A flat bar or narrow screwdriver will usually work for this step, but for very large fields of pavers, a large pry bar or wrecking bar may be required. Keep all joints as closely balanced and aligned as possible.

, You may find you have to pull a few pavers that are setting too high, so that a small amount of your base material can be scooped out to re-level them. Pavers that are too low, or appears to have sunk down, will need some additional setting material underneath them, as well.

, Use a broom to sweep the sand back and forth, tapping the pavers to help settle sand deeply into the joints.

Clean up.",How to Install Geopavers," If you don't have a set of plans created by a civil engineer, you'll need to design your own project. Consider the following points before you invest your time and money in the project:

Soil conditions. Geopavers need a stable subgrade material with at least moderate drainage to be effective and structurally sound.
Topography of the location. Geopavers are best suited for fairly level, flat surfaces. Special conditions may require the use of a geotextile fabric to insure the stability of the finished project.
Permitting. Local government agencies may have specific permitting and engineering requirements for surface pavements, including geopaver installation.
Accessibility. Heavy materials must be installed at the location you choose, so make sure you have a means of handling them safely and effectively.;
, They come in various sizes and configurations, so contacting potential suppliers will give you ideas of what is available and what is suitable for your project. Always check the manufacturer's installation instructions, if available; this article details a specific product, and other products may have requirements that differ substantially., Geopavers come in a number of configurations, including the 16 inch by 24 inch (40cm by 60.9cm) pavers shown in the illustrations. Multiplying the width times the length of your project area, then dividing the result by the size of the pavers will yield the approximate number of pavers the project will require. In the example in the photographs, an irregularly shaped area about 75 feet by (average width of) 30 feet (22.8 meters by 9.1 meters) meant about 1800 pavers were required. Also consider the following materials you will need:

Subgrade fill. This is the additional soil (or a quantity of soil that needs to be removed, if an excess amount is present) to give you a subgrade that is prepared for installing base.
Base material. This is a stable material that gives the finished project the desired structural properties. For heavy duty use, like the fire department access ramp in the illustrations, crushed concrete base material was installed over compacted fill to a depth of 8 inches (20.cm), then packed to a 95 percent density using a plate compactor.
Setting sand. Clean concrete sand is placed on the base material at a thickness of about 1 inch (2.cm), to allow the individual pavers to be leveled when they installed.
Fill material. Usually, clean sand is used to fill the joints and cells of the pavers, but the engineering requirements for the project in the photos meant filling them with #57 limestone aggregate.

, Do this after you've calculated the quantities, requested prices, and established the exact materials you'll use to meet your specific needs., Remove plants, large rocks, and other items which will interfere with installing the pavers. Relocate any underground utilities that may be affected, such as phone and cable television lines and lawn sprinkler pipes and heads., This can vary according to the amount of base material you need and the thickness of the geopavers you choose., Compact the base material with a plate compactor (or even a vibratory roller, for large projects), then recheck the grade., This material should be approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) thick, and must be leveled and compacted so that the pavers will set flatly on it. Using an asphalt rake (or landscape rake) makes leveling the sand easier. If you don't have an experienced eye for leveling the material, use a straightedge and screed the sand flat., Square it up, using a stringline if no appurtenance is located to that location for you to abut to., Lay it down the same way, making sure it is aligned with and flush to the first paver. Make sure the joint between the two pavers is kept tight, and continue laying pavers along the edge until you come to the end of the pavement area., Proceed in the same way followed in the previous step, keeping the side joints tight, and the top of the pavers level., Geopavers may vary in shape and size significantly depending on the manufacturer, and these differences may result in accumulative gain in individual rows of pavers if not addressed as they're installed.

Wear a respirator to protect you from being contaminated by the paver dust.

,, Tap down any pavers that aren't flush to the adjacent pavers with your rubber mallet. If possible, avoid raising low pavers, as the addition of setting sand to accomplish this will not be as stable as it should be., Generally, clean masonry sand or concrete sand is a good choice if no overriding conditions mandate the use of other materials., Sweep the sand or other fill material into the paver joints and cells with a push broom, allowing plenty of excess so all voids will be filled completely. You may use water to wash the material into the joints, especially if fine sand is used."

When you see the flagstones you will notice that they are of many sizes and shapes, being a natural material. Select stones enough for the surface area you plan to cover. Avoid those with a very uneven contour on either side. If there is an unbalanced contour on the bottom it can provide a place for the stone to break in half under traffic, and if the irregularity is on the top someone may trip on it. None, however, are smooth as concrete. Consider having them delivered.;
, Curved paths are more inviting because the eye does not see the destination immediately, rather a discovery process is enjoyed as one travels a curved walk.

, The grass can be planted as sod in another area, or composted.

, Use coarse ""washed"" sand, which lets rain percolate through, instead of clogging up.

, Fit the flagstones together jigsaw-puzzle style, but put the best walking stones in the center of the path. Space the stones according to the stride length of the average person who will use the path.

, Done!!

Take into account the soil, how much rain you get in the area and how much traffic goes over the surface. The principle is to place enough rock and gravel that will be able to hold the rainwater load long enough for the soil underneath the rock to absorb the water. Gravel and sandy soil drain water the best or the fastest and clay soil drains the worst or the slowest. So if you have an area with a lot of rain and clay soils, the rock and gravel with have to be very deep to be able to hold the rainwater while it slowly seeps into the soil. If you live in an area where there is little amount of rain and very good draining soil like sand and gravel, the depth of the rock and gravel might be very shallow, only 8 inches (20.3 cm). The next factor to consider is the traffic flow. The more traffic, the deeper the base. If it is a residential driveway used only to park cars, the depth of the base would be far less than a commercial street. There is software program available from Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute that contractors and engineers can use to get the correct depths and stone sizes.;
, This is usually done with a jackhammer to break up the existing driveway, and a bobcat or the like to remove the pieces.

,,, The purpose to the geotextile is to keep the soil from mixing with the rock and gravel base. Without the geotextile, the rock would work its way into the sub soil, decreasing the effective depth of the base material.

,,,,,, In this case we are using a concrete bond beam that the border pavers are set into when the concrete is still wet. This prevents lateral movement.

,, All water should be absorbed with zero run off.

",How to Build a Concrete Driveway," You will want to consider a number of things so that the driveway is functional, aesthetically pleasing, and durable. Here are some considerations.


Where will you turn your car around to enter the street? If your home is near a blind corner where oncoming traffic can be hazardous, you may want to create a circle drive, so you have the advantage of facing the street when pulling from your driveway, or make the drive wide enough to turn your car around when pulling out.
What is the lay of the land? If you are building on a hill, you will need to pay special attention to drainage to decrease soil erosion, as well as being careful that the contour is not so steep that you will bottom out your vehicle.
What obstructions are in the way of your project? Large rocks or trees may be difficult to remove without heavy equipment, and often it is desirable to leave these in place, so determining the path of the drive so it can either curve around obstacles or bypass them is essential.;
, To do this, you will have to calculate the amount of concrete you will need, the type of forms you will use, and any reinforcement material you will incorporate in the concrete slab. You should also estimate the cost of any equipment you will rent for grading or finishing, and the cost of labor if you intend to hire workers to help with the project.

, Since you are most likely abutting, or tying into, a residential street, you will probably have to egress on municipal or county right-of-way, which could impact buried utilities, stormwater runoff, or other existing conditions.

, Soft, loamy soils or loose, sandy soils need amending to support your drive. This can be done by adding clay to sandy soils, sand or gravel to loamy material, or possibly by mechanically compacting the existing material. If you are in doubt, consult an experienced builder or even a civil engineer before proceeding, since an unsuitable base will lead to failure of the concrete after your investment of time, labor, and money.

, You can do this by driving small wooden or metal stakes at points where the drive will egress the street, then at the end point near your home, then tying builder's line on them, to help you visualize the path of the driveway.

, This may be an appropriate step to consider the width you will build in. A minimum width for a typical residential driveway is about eight feet, but even for a single lane drive, ten or twelve feet is better. For two lane drives, sixteen feet should be considered minimum.

, Note, again, if the soil is particularly soft or unstable, you will want to remove enough so that a suitable fill material can be placed under the driveway as you build. Note that in very cold climates, a capillary fill material like crushed stone or gravel is desirable, to prevent cracks from forming and enlarging due to water expansion during freezing conditions.

, Some typical ones might be conduits for outdoor lighting or power, water lines for irrigation, as well as telephone lines or potable water lines for you home. Your property may also slope in such a way as to require an underground stormwater drainage pipe to transfer surface water from one side of your drive to another, or you may abut the street where water flows perpendicular to the new drive, requiring a culvert pipe to be installed so this flow is not impacted.

, Typically, these will be 1x4 or 2x4 nominal lumber, anchored with wooden stakes sufficiently to support the form boards. These stakes are driven into the soil with a sledgehammer at a spacing to keep the form boards on grade and straightly aligned. For curving drives, Masonite or plywood that is strong enough to support the concrete load, but flexible enough to bend for radii may be needed.

, Usually driveways are at least four inches thick; for heavier vehicles or difficult to stabilize soil conditions, thicker concrete is suggested. Grading is done by placing a straightedge or tying a string across the top of your forms and measuring down to the soil, to the correct depth. Remove or add fill material with a shovel. You may also want to thicken the edges, or make them deeper, for additional strength and to decrease the likelihood of cracking. Often, these small, monolithic footings, are eight inches deep and eight to twelve inches wide.

, You may be able to compact the soil by driving a vehicle back and forth over it, taking care not to become stuck if it is particularly soft when you begin. The important thing to note, is that the compaction of the soil is what will support the weight of the concrete, as well as the subsequent load of vehicles using the drive, so the importance of having compacted, stable fill material cannot be overstated.

, This can be a mat of steel reinforcing bars tied in place, typically number 4 rebar on 12 inch (30.5 cm) centers, or 6X6 welded wire reinforcing wire fabric, available at building supply stores. Another option is to have polypropylene fiber reinforcing added to the concrete mixture at the concrete plant.

, You will need the proper tools for the job, sufficient help to do it, and access for concrete trucks or an alternative method of placing the concrete in the forms. Wheel barrowing the plastic concrete the length of a substantial driveway is labor-intensive, so if you cannot get the concrete trucks in a position to discharge their payload directly into your forms, consider hiring a concrete pumping contractor to place the material for you.

, You will want to get the surface as flat (note, this does not mean level) as possible to avoid bird baths, or standing water, on it. You will also want to make sure the finish is not too smooth or slippery for traction for your car. A broom, or sack finish is often used. Either of these is created by dragging the aforementioned item (a push broom, or burlap sack) across the concrete while it is still slightly plastic, leaving a rough texture on its surface.

, This is done by creating a moisture retaining barrier on the concrete's surface, either with a layer of plastic sheeting, or by applying a chemical curing compound to prevent the concrete from drying out too quickly. You should protect your concrete drive from extreme weather conditions for at least three, and preferably seven days, so that it achieves its maximum strength.

, After allowing the concrete to cure sufficiently to support your vehicle...a minimum of three days, preferably more, drive your car on it to test its usability.

Make your garage suit you.",How to Choose an Exterior Finish for Your Garage," If your garage is going to be directly joined to your house, then it might be a good idea to match it up, as best as possible, with the exterior finish and material of the home. In some cases this won’t always be possible, or there might be a slight difference between the worn effect on your house, from older brickwork, and the brand new finish in place on your new garage. Depending on the look you are going for, you might want to think about using the same finish so that there isn’t a dramatic contrast.;
, If the garage will be built away from the house, then you might want to use a completely different exterior finish. Autumn red brickwork, Cotswold stone, or a textured style such as magnolia are just some of the options available to you.

, If you are getting your garage built by a supplier, then ask them if they have a brochure which details all of the personalised features. Alternatively, if your garage is going to be built by a team of people, then ensure you find a recommendation for a supplier who can provide the brick or stonework before the work takes place.

, Your garage doesn’t have to conform to traditional design as there is a range of choice available in the market. Do your research first and find a suitable design style for the exterior of your garage.

, You might be tempted to obtain a finish such as Cotswold stone, but if this goes over your budget allocation when planning for your new garage then it might be wise to reconsider and choose another design. Going over budget isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as long as this won’t cause a big dent to your finances. If for example you have a strict limit, whereby choosing one design would take you over by £1,000, then it’s probably going to involve a little readjusting in terms of planning and choosing a suitable design. If it fits in with your budget, looks good aesthetically, either from a standalone point of view or because it matches your home, then you have probably come to a reasonable decision.

, Remember, it’s all down to personal taste, as well as practicality, so take care to ensure the finish is something that you will enjoy now and for many years to come.

Determine the function of your shed.,
If you don't have much planning and building experience, you can purchase blueprints for your shed.,
Plan your own design.",How to Build a Storage Shed1," What you intend to use your shed for will affect the size, shape, and materials you will need. Here are some common shed uses:









Lawn and yard equipment. This is the most common use for sheds, and requires the least amount of work. These sheds are typically small and basic.
Household storage. Similar to the yard equipment shed, household storage may require more elaborate temperature and humidity control based on what is being stored.
Workshop. Workshops typically need to be bigger than a storage shed, so that you have room to move around and work on projects. With the addition of work benches and storage closets, these can be quite a bit more complex.
Car storage. A car storage shed will be one of the largest sheds you can build. It will require solid foundations and plenty of room, as well as car access to the front.;
, Several websites offer a variety of blueprints, most of which can be had for less that $30. Here are a couple places that you can find plans for sale:

Storage Shed Plans

My Backyard Plans has several free plans available voted by community members.

, If you'd rather build the entire shed from your own design, be sure to plan everything out from the start. You will need a blueprint for each of the following:

Foundation. The foundation needs to be solid, and the plywood on it able to hold up the weight of what you're storing without stressing or cracking.













Back wall. Each wall is constructed separately and then raised.






Front wall with door. You will need to leave room in the frame for a door. The size of the door is dictated by what you are using the shed for, and what you need to move in and out.






Side walls with window. If you aren't wiring your shed for electricity, then windows are your only source of light. Try to face your windows east and west to maximize the amount of sunlight that can enter your shed. Also keep in mind that windows effectively prevent you from using that portion of the wall as hanging storage space, so avoid putting windows in every available spot.






Roof rafters. A sloped roof will help prevent any water damage, and keep debris from resting on top of the roof. Rafters can be utilized for storage as well.






Roof decking. The most common types of roofing for sheds are asphalt or cedar shingles, though tin or sheet metal can also be used.

Once you have bolted all the timbers together and have an assembled bent it is time to raise it into place.,
Before painting or sealing your barn with any finish allow your barn to season.",How to Build a Post and Beam Barn,"


Clear any brush from your site.
Have an excavator come in and level your site. Or rent the equipment and do the site prep yourself.;
, There are many options when choosing your foundation type. Post and beam barns can be constructed on most conventional foundation systems. The most popular type of foundation is poured concrete piers. However your barn kit can also be constructed on poured wall foundations, concrete wall foundations, and slab on grade foundations. Check your local building codes to see what is required.

, Depending on the size of your barn kit more than one Truck may be arriving at your site. Be sure that you have a 5,000 lb capacity or larger forklift on site for unloading the truck. It is a good idea to rent a Tele-handler type forklift with a 35' or more reach.


A forklift like this will be a great help not only in unloading but also in raising assembled bents and lifting material to workers on your barn.

,


Be sure to stack all lumber off the ground, try not to open the banding until you begin building.
Do not cover your material with tarps. Doing this will lock moisture inside the cover. Store your wood in a shaded area if possible. Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause your wood to discolor. The less wood to wood contact during storage the better.

, Arrange them according to their joint labels. Use bent jacks to support the timbers off the ground if you have them. Otherwise heavy duty saw horses can be used.
Bolt the posts and beams together with 1/2"" x 7 1/2"" Hex head bolts and steel T plates.
Determine the exact length of your posts according to your plans and trim them to length.
Use a drilling jig to drill two 9/16"" holes through the bottom of your posts to accept your U brackets.

place the U bracket on the bottom of your post and mark the location of the holes.
Drill two starter holes about 1/2"" deep.
Place 2 bolts in your drilling jig and slide it over the holes until they drop into the holes you drilled, this lines up your jig for drilling. (the jig keeps your bit square to the post)
Clamp the jig securely to the post. Remove the bolts and drill the holes through the post.
Remove the jig and bolt the U bracket in place.



, (Note: bents wider than 20' will need to be erected in smaller segments)


Raise your bent and brace it securely. It is very important to adequately secure and brace your bents. Use 2x6 boards nailed or screwed in a criss cross pattern to the posts. Do not remove any bracing until all the bents are raised and secured together with girts and purlins.
Place the U brackets in their proper locations on your foundation. Drill into the foundation through the holes in the flange.
Drive wedge anchor bolts into the holes and tighten them.
As your bents are raised into place it is time to attach your 3x6 purlins and 2x6 girts. Attach purlins with 6"" screws or nails, and girts with 4"" screws or nails. Refer to your plans for proper spacing. Be sure to leave an overhang on the gable ends.

Here is a drawing showing the correct placement of your board and batten siding. Try using 2 1/2"" ring shank exterior grade nails. Be sure to use careful cutting procedures to minimize waste.

Here is a drawing that shows how your roof sheathing should be installed. Be sure once again to cut carefully.



, Avoid painting or sealing until after 6 months or more. It would be best to allow your wood to go unfinished one full winter. This allows your wood to fully season and prevents moister from being trapped inside the wood. The suns ultraviolet rays may discolor the wood during this time period. A simple way to correct this is to power wash the barn a week before applying finish. Do not hold the power washer nozzle to close to the wood, you could damage the wood fibers. Make long sweeping motions across the surface of the wood. This discoloring is only cosmetic and no power washing is needed if color is being applied.

Figure your roof area, and calculate how much felt you will need for the job .,
Clean the roof decking of any debris, protruding nails, or other objects or materials that will damage the roof felt.








,
Make sure the surface is dry.,
Replace any damaged or rotten material on the roof decking.








,
Begin at the bottom of the decking, on one end, and roll the felt length way, along the lower edge of your roof.,
Allow the lower edge of the felt to overhand the eave about 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) so water will drip off without wetting the decking underneath.








,
Tack the end of the felt where you begin rolling it to hold it in place while the rest is unrolled.








,
Pull the felt tight from the opposite end, taking care not to rip it, but making sure it lies flat on the roof surface.








,
Nail the felt with simplex or plastic cap felting nails.,
Cut the felt at the opposite end of your roof, and roll felt back in the opposite direction, allowing about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of overlap to the first layer.,
Overlap the ridge of your roof about one foot, then apply the material in the same manner on the opposite side.








,
Cover all nail heads with a roofing mastic or tar if this is going to be more than a temporary waterproofing measure.








",How to Attach Roof Felt on a Shed," One roll of 15# (pound) felt has 432 square feet, but you must allow for overlaps on joints, In most cases this will leave 400sq ft net coverage.






;
,, Never apply roof felt over wet or damp decking, as this condition will cause the decking to warp or buckle, and possibly rot.








,, For hip type shed roofs, begin at the hip, allowing a foot or so of the felt to hang over the hip.








,,,, These should be spaced at about 12 inch (30.5 cm) centers along the bottom edge, and 30-36 centers along the top, since subsequent overlaps will be nailed through the top of the last layer applied. Be careful to drive nails flush and not penetrate the felt, or you will have a leak.








, Most roof felt has guide lines stencilled on it to ensure you apply it in straight, parallel lines.

Check your local zoning laws.,
Plan where to build.,
Assemble your tools and cut your lumber.",How to Build a Storage Shed2," Most areas require a permit if a building is being constructed over a certain size, so be sure to check and see if you can legally build without a permit.









If you need a permit, then you will most likely have to work with a building inspector. You must have a working set of plans for the shed in this case.

, There are multiple factors to take into account when building a shed. Be sure to give careful thought to all of them in order to avoid a serious hassle once you've finished. Here are some things to keep in mind:

Location of utility lines. Get in touch with your local utilities to find out where gas, electricity, and water lines run through your property. In the US, you can call 811 for the National Digline. Building over these lines can make any repairs that need to be done to them overly difficult or impossible, and can be dangerous to people in the building.













Property lines. Make sure that the entirety of your shed is on your own property. Ensure that the eaves of the shed do not hang over into your neighbor's property.






Moisture. Avoid building the shed in a low area of the yard where moisture collects, and always install a proper drainage system. The ground around your shed will always be soggy. Moisture can also rot wood, rust hinges, and deteriorate whatever you're storing.






Ground angle. You want your shed to be as level as possible. Adjust the ground yourself if you have to by digging out the flat spot and filling in any holes. If the ground cannot be leveled, you will need to build your foundation so that the structure will still be flat.






Surrounding trees. Try to leave a few feet of space on all sides of the shed. This will make the shed easier to access and reduce the growth of mold and mildew. Build your shed in direct sunlight if possible to further reduce growth.














,









The average 8'x8' shed will require almost 100 pieces of wood precisely cut to construct. Use cedar if allowed in your area as it does not change size very much through temperature changes.
Rafters and trim require wood to be cut at a 45° angle. For this you will need a miter.
Remember the adage ""measure twice, cut once."" Take your time cutting your materials to avoid wasting time and money. Alternatively, many major home supply stores offer lumber cutting services. Take your plans with you and have the cuts made in the store when you purchase the materials.
Besides the wood, you will need several pounds of nails, roof tacks for the shingles, hinges for the doors, and prefabricated windows for the walls. You will also need gussets (triangle pieces of wood) for the rafters.

"
"
Lay your foundation.,
Build your walls.,
Raise the two remaining walls.,
Build the roof.",How to Build a Storage Shed3," Without a solid foundation, the shed will not last.









Level the ground as much as possible. Clear any rocks or protruding roots. Fill in any potholes. Call an excavator if the build site is beyond your capacity to prepare.
The average shed can be supported by a foundation of concrete blocks or pressure-treated wood skids. Use solid concrete blocks for the foundation. Larger sheds will require a permanent concrete foundation much like a house. You will need to contact your local building department to find out the precise foundation requirements for your area.
Use pressure-treated lumber, especially in the foundation. Treated lumber will resist rotting much more than untreated.
For a solid, rigid floor use 3/4"" pressure-treated Tongue and Groove plywood. The plywood locks together, and the pressure treatment prevents rot from excess moisture. You may need to install floor joints to support plywood.
If possible, build your shed several inches above the ground to allow air and water to pass underneath. This will add to the longevity of your shed.

, Start by constructing the frames for the two side walls. Afterwards, construct the front and back frame, with a space for the door in the front.









If you are putting in windows, be sure to construct the frame accordingly. The window must be supported on all sides by 2x4s.
A basic wall frame is composed of 2x4 studs evenly spaced along the frame every 16 to 24 inches (40 to 60 cm). Window holes require extra smaller studs to support it.
Attach the siding to the frame while it is lying flat. It will be much easier to attach the large piece before you raise the frames up.
Once both side walls are completed, raise them up so that they are 90° to the foundation. Hold them up for the time being with planks nailed to both the foundation and the wall frames.

,









Attach them to the roof and the two side walls.
Install the door in the spot made in the front wall.
Install prefabricated windows in the windows spots in your side walls.

, After the two side walls are raised, connect them by building the rafters and roof.









The rafters continue up from the studs in the wall.
Build each rafter truss (the triangle construction of the rafter) separately, using the first completed one as a template for the others.
When attached, the bottom of the rafter should be flush with the siding.
Once the rafters are all attached, cover the roof frame with decking material. Then, shingle the roof. There are multiple different patterns you can use when shingling a roof. It is recommended that you follow the manufacturer's specification for shingle placement.

"
"
Paint or stain your wood.,
Wire the shed for electricity.",How to Build a Storage Shed4," To help protect your new shed against weather, you should paint or stain it.









Use the same paint that your house was painted with if you wish to make the shed match the look of your house. If you don't want them to match, pick a color from the same family so that the shed and the house complement each other.
A clear stain will keep the shed's rustic appeal by not covering up the wood construction while still protecting it from the elements.
Use either a sprayer or paint roller, with a hand brush for details and trim.

, If you plan to use the shed as a workshop, or want to put a refrigerator or freezer in it, then the shed will need to be wired for electricity.









WARNING: Wiring electricity is extremely hazardous if you do not take all the necessary precautions. It is highly recommended that you hire a professional electrician. You will also need a permit and inspection beforehand.

"
"
Level the ground (if necessary) and install deck piers along a grid to support the shed.,
String support beams lengthwise across the deck piers.,
Attach joists to the support beams and separate them with blocking.,
Nail plywood sheeting to the joists to form the floor.,
Build the framework for all four walls.,
Build rafters across the roof and separate them with blocking.,
Nail plywood sheeting to the rafters to form the roof.,
Cover the walls.,
Add tar paper to the roof.",How to Build a Shed," The piers will allow you to string support beams beneath the floor of the shed. In the example design, the piers are spaced 6 feet (1.8 m) apart in one direction and 4 feet (1.2 m) apart in the other for a total grid area of 12 x 8 feet. This is convenient because once you lay supports along this grid, it will take exactly three standard 4- by 8-foot plywood sheets to cover it.









Note that in some countries, you must obtain a permit before doing any in-ground foundation work. If you would rather avoid this, you can build the shed on the ground by replacing the beams (see below) with 4x6-inch (102x152-mm) skids of pressure-treated lumber that is approved for ground contact, or by using precast concrete fence posts.;
, This will support your floor joists, which run in the opposite direction. The easiest way to attach the beams to the piers is with metal straps, which have built-in nail holes. In the example design, the beams are 12-foot-long 4x6”s.








,

First, you will need to attach a rim joist along the outer edge of each outermost support beam; each of these will need to be the same length as the beam underneath.













Then, you will need to install a series of floor joists across the entire length of the support beams; these will need to be the same length as the distance between the two rim joints so that they’ll fit between them. In the example design, the floor joists are all separated by 14.5-inch gaps except for the outermost two, which are 13 3⁄4 inches (34.9 cm) from their immediate neighbors; this is to allow a standard piece of plywood to line up with the outermost edge of the outermost joist but only cover half of an interior joist, allowing its neighbor to cover the other half so that both can be supported properly.













To keep the floor joists from moving, install a piece of blocking between each pair of floor joists along the center support beam.














, If necessary, use H-clips in addition to nailing the sheets into place; these fit between two pieces of plywood and lock them together for additional structural strength. In the example design, two standard sheets of 4- by 8-foot plywood are used whole and a third is sawn in half and used to fill in the 4-foot difference on either end. Because of the spacing of the piers, support beams, and joists, no additional cuts or adjustments are necessary. Note that the pieces of plywood are intentionally misaligned so that the floor doesn’t have a single seam running across the whole thing, which would be a significant structural weakness.









Flooring may also be screwed down with 3-inch deck screws.

, To account for the fact that the front and back walls are different from each other (due to the doorframe in the front) and the side walls must both be sloped (to prevent rain from collecting on the roof), each of these will have to be tackled somewhat differently. It’s easiest to construct the back first, the front second, and the two sides last, as shown in the numbered image below. See How to Frame a Wall for more information before you read the instructions below.


Build the framework for the back wall. Make the top and bottom beams (a.k.a. the plates) the same length as the length of the floor which they sit. To keep your measurements simply, make the spacing between the vertical studs identical to the spacing between your floor joists. Note that the back wall should be lower than the front wall so that the roof slopes and directs rain away from the door.














Build the framework for the front wall. The front wall should be the same as the back wall except taller and with a door frame so that you can hang a door in the shed when you’re done.














Build the framework for the side walls. The bottom plate of each side wall should be the same length as the distance between the bottom plates of the front and back wall (so that the side walls will fit between them). The standard spacing between vertical wall studs in the US is 16 inches (from center to center, not from edge to edge); since this stud spacing doesn’t perfectly divide into the total length of the side walls in the example design, the two outermost studs make up for this discrepancy by being slightly closer to their neighbors. Most importantly, the top plate is angled so that the roof will be sloped, which makes the height of each vertical stud slightly different. If you’re not sure how to calculate the necessary height of each vertical stud in advance, make the two outermost vertical studs first, lay them the correct distance apart, cut a top plate that spans this distance, and then cut each remaining vertical stud individually based on the distance between the top and bottom plates at that exact location.













Assemble the four wall structures. Wall structures are usually nailed to the underlying support from the bottom up. However, if this is not possible with the design you’ve chosen, simply nail them downwards through the plywood and joists or toenail them into place by driving the nails downwards and at an angle. Note that you will probably need other people to help you hold the wall structures up until they can be attached to one another.

, These should overhang the walls of your shed for increased weather protection. Again, your measurements will be greatly simplified if you space the rafters the same way that you spaced your floor joists. When you’re done, attach pieces of blocking between each pair of rafters along the top plates.








, If you have added overhang, the plywood layout you used to cover the floor will have to be amended.








, You can use siding, textured plywood, or anything else that gives the shed a more finished look.








, Start from the lower end of the roof slope and work your way upwards, making sure that each new level of paper overlaps the one below it to keep rain from seeping into the cracks. You can also use shingles or other roofing material if desired.

As you sort, you should also create three other piles for things that you want to recycle, throw away, or donate. Once you have sorted everything and removed the things you want to get rid of, you should have a better idea of what your needs are going to be.Be sure to responsibly dispose of any chemicals or other hazardous chemicals in your garage. Do not simply throw them in the trash or pour them the drain. Contact your local hazardous waste site about disposing of excess chemicals.;
, When sorting the things in your garage, determine what items will be stored together. Keeping similar things together will make it easier for you to find them later. It will also help you determine what kind of storage system to invest in.For example, put all of your gardening supplies in one group and your sports gear in another.

, Once you sort everything, make a floor plan of your garage. With a tape measure, note the measurements of the garage, paying particular attention to the windows, doors, and any utilities. You should also figure out how much space you will need for your car. After you make your measurements, plot out the dimensions of your garage on grid paper and highlight the areas where you can store things., Using your floor plan, consider the types of storage space you will want to add and the space requirements of each item. Some shelving and vertical storage space systems will allow you to maximize your wall space without giving up much floor room. Things like plastic bins and cabinets will take up more space, but they are useful for storing things long term.Remember to keep garden tools, bikes, and other frequently used outdoor gear near the garage door.
Make sure that the trash and recycling are easily accessible from the door to the house.
Keep your seasonal items in the hardest to reach places, like the top of a shelf.

, Angle the roof so rain is directed away from the building's perimeter. You may need a simple gutter or downspout drainage piping to prevent pooling at the base of the lean to. If your region receives heavy snowfall, build the roof to withstand that load.

Also decide how the roof of the lean-to will interface with the roof of the shed.

, Even though the addition is small, a solid foundation is important. Use the best materials within your budget. Here are some solid examples:

Concrete blocks
Concrete footer with a small stem wall to prevent water from seeping in
Concrete pier pads with the top flush to ground level
You can use pressure-treated skids for additional support, but do not rely on them as your sole foundation.
You can use a 4"" x 4"" pressure treated post to establish the vertical upright framing.

, Lumber is a fairly strong and inexpensive material for framing, and tin is a suitable roofing and siding material.


Other options include shingle roofing, rolled roofing, metal flashing to waterproof the join between the new roof and the existing one, metal studs for framing, and cementitious board or composite sidings.
Choose the materials that are suitable for your location and climate as well as materials that will match your existing building.
Be sure to plan to use a sheath of CDX plywood on the wall that abuts against the structure. CDX plywood resists indirect moisture.

, Some basic items that a lean-to addition for a tin shed would use include:


Poles for supporting the eave framing.

4"" x 4"" pressure treated southern yellow pine will support a lightweight roof framed with 2"" x 4"" boards, spanning less than 15 feet (4.6 m) or so.
For a longer, heavier roof span, 6"" x 6"" timbers or even steel columns may be more suitable.


Rafters for framing the actual supporting structure of the roof will need to be strong enough to support the weight of the lathing, the decking and the workmen who will walk on the roof while installing it.

A somewhat typical span of less than 10 feet (3.0 m) may be framed with southern yellow pine if the rafters are free of large or loose knots and are otherwise structurally sound. You may use Douglas fir, hemlock, or cedar instead.
Lodgepole pine, spruce and other softer pine species are too knotty and not strong enough for roofing unless the rafters are from large diameter trees.
For roof spans 10 feet (3.0 m) or greater, 2"" x 6"" nominal framing or larger, should be used.


The rafter nailers spanning between the posts on the eave side of your lean-to must be strong enough to support the load of multiple rafters.

Use a minimum size of 2"" x 6"" nominal southern yellow pine or other strong wood.
Nailers attached directly to the wall of the building onto which the lean-to is being added can be the same size lumber as the rafters themselves as long as the nailer is attached securely to the wall of your building.
Local building code and the existing wall material will determine which anchors to use. These may include lag bolts (to attach to large diameter wooden beams), threaded bolt nuts and large diameter washers (drilled into hollow concrete blocks), or hurricane anchors.


Lathing strips, or the framing members that lay across the rafters that the metal roofing is attached to should be sound southern yellow pine or a similar lumber.

1"" x 4"" lathing lumber is sufficient to support a normal load on spans where the rafters are located at 24 inch center spacing or less.
2"" x 4"" lumber is easier to fasten to (it bounces less when nails are driven into it), and may not be significantly more expensive than the 1"" x 4""s.
If you are laying a plywood ""roof decking"" directly onto the rafters, then you only need lathing to brace between the rafters or to prevent side-to-side movement by cross-tying them to the bottoms of the rafters.


Nails or screws to act as fasteners.

Nails should be large enough to penetrate the attached member and the supporting member deeply enough to secure the two pieces.
Screws may be used to attach dissimilar materials, such as metal framing, roofing, or siding to wood framing, or even for joining two separate wood members.

Additions and construction on residential property can significantly affect the property value of the home, making it important to clear projects with the city. In some areas, you'll likely need to produce structurally sound building drawings bearing the signature of a licensed structural engineer.To obtain the necessary permits, you'll likely need to produce:


Proof of property ownership
Permit application worksheets, provided by the city
Construction drawings;
, You can build carports from wood or metal, depending on the style and type of precipitation from which you hope to guard your vehicle. Depending on the climate where you live, different materials and designs may be more or less appropriate. Feel free to customize the basic design and use whatever materials are available or cheap, depending on the type of carport you want to make. It's a good opportunity to experiment.



Pressure-treated lumber may be more appropriate for drier climates, but will prove to be more durable and customizable in the long run regardless of the climate. A wooden structure built properly will be much sturdier than other structures. If you want a long-term place to park a car, go with lumber.

Galvanized metal carports are much cheaper and quicker to install, though ultimately less sturdy in the long run. If you need a quick, cheap place to house a daily-driver, it's a good option. Often, pre-fabricated carports made of galvanized metal are the best bet for a DIYer in need of a quick project.

, To accommodate an average-sized car, measure a rectangle at least 16 feet (4.9 m) long and nine feet wide. Plot this rectangle on the ground. A basic carport requires six posts, one at each corner of the rectangle, and two more at the middle positions along the 16 foot (4.9 m) length.


If you've got a bigger car or truck, or you want to make a carport for multiple vehicles, make the necessary adjustments to accommodate for the size structure you hope to create.

, Remove any grass in layers with a shovel, raking over the under layers with a metal rake, tamping it with foot-pressure and the same rake. It doesn't need to be perfect, but you might consider measuring for grade to make sure your ground is as flat as possible.


If you want to build a carport on an existing concrete pad, or the end of your driveway, that's perfectly appropriate. Measure the dimensions of your concrete pad and shape the structure to the ground, rather than the other way around. You can either build the structure with the poles to either side of the pad, anchoring them in the ground., Bare ground is fine in some cases, but consider putting down a layer of gravel to avoid tracking dirt into the house and wearing down the ground around the carport over time. If you don't want to lay gravel, consider laying some dark weed matting down to keep grass and weeds from re-growing.


The best idea would be to pour concrete, or build on top of pre-existing concrete slab. This will give your carport the most life and durability.

, The materials and the time can make building a carport a fairly intensive project, which might mean that a pre-fabricated kit might be more appropriate, given your wishes and your abilities.Metal building materials are usually available for cheaper than the price of a lumber carport kit, complete with installation instructions. You can put it up in a day or so.

, Equally space hole posts around the perimeter of your measured outline for the carport, then use post-hole diggers to dig the holes. The holes should be at least two feet deep, and deeper for a more stable structure if you live in a high-wind climate or an area that receives lots of heavy snowfall.

, For the simplest kind of structure, you'll need heavy-duty posts at least nine feet high on one side of the carport and 11 feet (3.4 m) high on the other side to give the roof enough of a slant to clear any amount of rainwater. The three higher posts should be on the side of the carport closest to the house to divert water away from the foundation of the home.


To set the posts, pour concrete six inches deep in the two-foot deep hole, then plant the post into the hole so it rests on the bottom. Pour more concrete until the hole is filled. Use a level and make adjustments as the concrete is hardening to ensure that the post is perfectly vertical. Allow the concrete to harden for at least one full day before nailing on the beams.

, To secure the walls of the carport, you'll basically build a simple rectangular box approximately 16 feet (4.9 m) long, nine feet wide, and roughly seven feet high, secured onto the posts.Secure two supporting crossbeams flat on the top of the shorter corner posts and extend to the higher corner posts about two feet down from their tops. Next, nail them to the higher posts using T-shape hangers that can be purchased at any hardware store. Before nailing the beams down through the T-shape hangers, make sure they are level.

, Nail crossbeams across your posts to secure them to the proper code specifications. The beam on the lower side should be nailed on top of the front and back beams, which themselves have been already nailed to the top of the corner posts. If necessary, you can shim to connect them by nailing on top of the middle post on the lower side, making the beam level across all three posts.


It's important to make your structure as secure as possible, especially if you live in snowy, windy, or other severe climates. For load-bearing specifications, you need to research the requirements in your area. There's no single, universal way of doing it, so defer to your local guidelines always.

, The six 2” x 4” x 10’ rafters that will support the roof can be fastened to the core box in one of two ways: the notch method or the hanger method. In either case, the front rafter and back rafter should be fastened flush with the front beam and the back beam. The remaining four rafters should be arranged equidistant from each other, along the length of the 16-foot side beams, about every 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m).To notch the rafters, the idea is to rest them on edge of the beams. To do this, put the front rafter in position, and note where it comes into contact with the side beams with a pencil mark. At that point, notch the rafter with the circular saw so that in the finished position the rafter sinks about 1/3 of the four inches onto the beam. Once you are satisfied with how this first rafter rests on the side beams, take it down and use it as a template to notch the other five rafters. When fastening the rafters, angle nails through the side of the rafter into the beam below.

To hang the rafters, buy some metal hangers at the hardware store. There are many different shapes and styles of metal hangers that fasten 2” x 4”s to other structural elements in a variety of orientations. The relevant angle in this structure, the angle of the rafters to the beams, is about 25 degrees. These metal hangers can bend to accommodate small variations, so don’t worry about finding the perfect one. Unlike with the notch method, with the hanger method the rafters rest on top of the beams. Your nails will go through the hanger into the rafter, then into the beam.

, Arrange the plywood sheets so that they produce a six-inch overhang on the front and back of the carport as well. This way you will have a uniform look to the carport.


Buy plywood sheets as large as you can get them. Typically, they come in 4’ x 8’ sheets, but sizes vary. The entire roof surface is 10’ x 17’. Cut elements with the circular saw to produce the fewest number of seams. The fewer the seams, the less potential for water leakage.
The core box of your carport is nine feet wide and the rafters are ten feet long. This means that when the roof elements are in place, you will need enough plywood for about a six-inch overhang on either side of the cart port. If you want it to be longer, accommodate by buying more plywood.
Plywood comes in a variety of thicknesses. For this project you can use ½ inch thick plywood. If you are worried about warping, use ¾ inch plywood., Now that the roof is in place, your structure should be quite solid. Nothing you do from this point in the process to the end will improve the carport’s overall stability, so if there is excessive movement, you will have to add stability braces on the outside of the structure to reinforce it.

, To keep the elements out, it's important to fill the gap between the boards with caulk and create as waterproof a surface as possible before shingling over it. There's no sense in creating a carport to keep your car out of the rain if it leaks.


Would it be smarter to insulate the structure? Maybe, but probably not cost-effective. Remember, you're not building an addition to your house, you're building a simple structure to keep junk off your car.

, Visit the hardware store and buy enough three-tab shingles to lay over the plywood and finish the surface of the carport. It might be a good idea to nail some weather sheeting over the plywood before you lay the shingles for an extra layer of protection.


Alternatively, if you don't want to shingle the roof, you could skip the plywood roof step altogether and install a metal roof over the shingles. A slanted aluminum roof is common in outbuildings and you'll be that much closer to being finished. It might be a good idea, if you can stand the look of it and the loud sound of rain on metal.

, For extra stability in the places where the structure meets, it's a good idea to reinforce with metal bracing. Your hardware store sells a variety of metal plates that can be nailed onto the various joints in the structural composition, especially where the posts meet the beams, where the beams meet the rafters, and at other places.

, Since you've gone to all the work, it's a good idea to treat the exposed wood with a coat of protecting stain. This will increase the life of the wood and keep you from having to repeat the project in a few years.


It's a good idea to restain regularly to keep the life of the structure up. Revisit your work periodically to catch up with repairs before they become a major problem.

Put together a track-based vertical organizing system.",How to Add Storage Space to Your Garage2," One simple way to maximize the space in your garage is by making some shelves. You can build some floating floating shelves on your walls or install premade shelving. Shelves are a good choice because they are inexpensive, easier to access, and let you take stock of your items.If you buy ready-made shelves, make sure that they are raised so that you can easily clean underneath them.
If you want to be thrifty, consider installing second-hand kitchen cabinets in your garage.If you have the space, consider installing some hooks on the underside of your shelves to hang lighter items from.

, A pegboard is easy to install and relatively inexpensive. The flat piece of particleboard with evenly spaced holes can be attached to most walls. You can also paint it whatever color you want and alter it to fit a wall space of any size. A pegboard is perfect for storing lightweight things like hand tools or sports equipment.You should be able to find pegboard and hooks at your local hardware store.

, This high-end system allows you to maximize your wall space. Each wall in your garage is finished with slotted plastic panels that hold and lock-in hooks, shelves, and cabinets. However, the system is expensive and most have to be installed by professionals.This system is a great option for those who want get the most out of every inch of wall space in their garage. It can handle lightweight and heavy items.
You can go online to find local professionals to install the panels in your garage.

, In this system, shelves, hooks, cabinets, and other organizers hang from tracks that are affixed to the garage walls by studs. This system is relatively cheap, extremely versatile, and capable of handling large and heavy loads. However, it can be difficult to install. You will need to make sure that each track is level with the ones next to it so that the shelving hangs straight.You can find tracks and shelves at most hardware stores.
If your garage is not plumb, you may have a difficult time getting your tracks and shelves level. Using a level, you should check the level of your garage before you install the tracks.

Get some stackable plastic bins.,
Find a lockable cabinet.,
Hang things from the ceiling.",How to Add Storage Space to Your Garage3," Plastic bins will help you store loose items that would otherwise take up a lot of space. These are ideal for lightweight things like holiday decorations or sports and outdoor gear. The tubs offer some protection from the elements and can be stacked on top of each other for added space.Consider using clear bins so that the contents are visible. You can also label the containers or color-code them to help keep track of the contents.
You can find these tubs at most major retail stores.

, If you have any hazardous materials or dangerous items, a locked cabinet will help keep those things out of the hands and mouths of any kids or animals. These cabinets are good for storing lawn chemicals, like pesticides and herbicides, as well as bladed tools. A sturdy cabinet will help you organize things and keep them stored safely., If you have some lighter items that might take up too much shelf space, you might want to consider hanging them from the ceiling. You can install cheap hooks from your local hardware store in the rafters of your garage to hang thinks like bikes, canoes, and kayaks. You can also have heavy-duty industrial racks installed professionally. These large racks will allow you to take advantage of overhead space.For the larger racks, you will need to hire professionals to install the system in your garage.
Before you hang anything from the ceiling, you should make sure that everything is securely installed and that things will not fall onto someone.

Attach any purlins you plan to use on the outboard side of your lean-to.",How to Add a Lean To Onto a Shed2," Remove any debris or vegetation that will be a problem during construction or future use, and grade the soil to a suitable elevation. If you are going to leave an earth floor in the addition, compacting the soil probably will not be necessary.


Make sure the floor material will withstand expected weather conditions year-round.

, Check the placement before, during, and after you dig. The distance between posts depends on the load of the rafters, roof, and any future snow load. Check your local building code for guidelines.


Measure the distance between the wall to which you will fasten the lean-to and the starting corner.
You can start by pulling string lines along the planned addition. Use the 3-4-5 rule to confirm the outer corners are square before you dig the holes. If the outer wall is not parallel to the shed, the rafters will be difficult to place.

, Secure each post as follows:


Plumb two adjacent sides of the post to confirm the post is level.
Secure those two sides with temporary diagonal cross bracing, using two 1"" x 4"" boards. Drive a wooden stake into the ground next to each board.
Fasten each 1"" x 4"" board to a stake and to the post using easily removed nails or screws.
Once the end posts are in place, repeat with the intermediate posts.

, For best results, mix a ""post mix"" concrete and pour it into the post hole. Leave the bracing in place for at least 24 hours or until the concrete sets, then remove it.


If your lean to is small and your area does not experience strong wind or severe storms, you may be able to backfill the post holes with dirt instead.

,


This line will determine the bearing height of the rafters.
Start by marking the end posts, and use either a plain line or a chalk line to mark the intermediate posts.

,


Draw a notch about 1-1/2"" (about 4 cm) deep into your post.
Use a circular saw set to a 1-1/2"" (about 4 cm) depth to cut into the post at the base of the notch.
Set the circular saw to maximum depth. Measure out 1-1/2"" (about 4 cm) on the top side of your post and cut into the top of the post on the same side as you made the first cut. When your saw blade meets the first cut, the wood block should fall off, leaving the notch for your nailers.
If necessary, finish the cut with a hand saw or a reciprocating blade saw.
Repeat the process with each post.
If you choose to, you may simply nail directly into the side of the post, but doing so places all the weight on your fasteners. You could also use metal hangers or brackets to attach the top beam or plate to the posts, using heavy gauge TECO nails.

,


If the nailer is not long enough to span the total length of your shed, make sure any joints are set against a post to ensure maximum bearing potential for the nailer.
Nail the nailer into place, making sure the spacing between your posts remains correct.

, Remember to nail everything solidly as you install it, so you will not overlook a critical connection before moving to the subsequent step in the project.

"
"
Fasten the nailer to the side of your existing building where you will attach the upper end of your rafters.,
Lay out the rafter spacing on the upper and lower nailers.,
Determine the roof pitch by stringing a line from the top rafter attaching point to the bottom one.,
Cut 1 end of the rafters at the angle given to you by the speed square.,
Nail the rafters against the top nailers.,
Space the lower end of your rafters on the layout marks and toenail them into place.",How to Add a Lean To Onto a Shed3,"


To attach a wooden nailer to a metal-sided building, use a self-drilling screw with sufficient threads to hold the nailer tightly. If possible, nail through the siding into the building's framing members.
Regardless of what method you choose to attach this member, make sure it is fastened securely. This is critical because the nailer it will support the weight of the roofing, the framing and the person performing the installation.


,


Starting at 1 end, measure the span you determined to use when you designed the building, and mark each space.
Marking the edge of the rafter rather than its center will make the mark more visible when you position the rafter.


,


Hold a speed square (also known as a rafter square) plumb against the top nailer where your string is fastened.
Read the angle on the square's angle scale.


,


Test the cut by holding the rafter in position. If the cut does not fit tightly, adjust it. A good fit will increase the hold of your nails when you attach the rafters.
When you have established the best angle for the top cut of your rafters, cut each one using that angle.
Unless you are certain both nailers are exactly parallel, do not cut the lower end of the rafter. This can be done after the rafters are installed, if cutting them is necessary.

, For best results, use metal brackets attached to a ledger board. Alternatively, use the toenail nailing method.


Use a pencil to mark the position where you want your boards to join at a right angle.
Place the rafter about 1/4"" (6 mm) in front of the nailer.
Place the nail about 1/2"" from the connection point and nail it in straight into the rafter. The key to toenailing is to drive the nail in straight and then at an angle. Tap the nail into the wood about 1/4"" (6 mm).
Pull the nail up at about a 50-degree angle. Drive the nail in until it protrudes slightly from the rafter.
Reposition the board to ensure that the angle is exact. Finish driving your nail through the rafter and into the nailer.
Avoid starting the nails too close to the end of the board, as this may split it, and make a strong connection impossible. If this is unavoidable, pre-drill the hole at the correct angle first.

, Use as many nails as possible without splitting the rafter, especially if you are not planning to use a structural anchor like a hurricane clip to supplement the nail's holding ability.

, Having a clean, fresh space will make it much easier to identify any alterations that might be necessary before installing the frame and mounting the screening.

, Before beginning on the full porch screen, make sure to install any ceiling panels or ceiling fans you may want on your porch. Obviously, ceiling fans must be installed before ceiling panels to allow the wiring to be installed properly.

, Using a hammer and pry bar, remove any wood battens that may be attached to the existing porch frame.


A batten is simply a squared piece of wood or metal used to hold the frame in place.

, Sill plates (also sometimes referred to as ""sole plates"") are usually just pieces of pressure-treated wood, often 2x4 lengths cut to measure, that are attached horizontally along the floor and ceiling of the porch area. Sill plates function as the base for the screen frame as they effectively create a network between the existing supports of the porch roof.

, Install the wood around the perimeter of the porch, making sure the corners are square (you can use a framing square for this purpose).


On a wooden porch, the plates can be nailed into position. With a concrete porch, using a drill and masonry screws or a masonry nail gun will be required.

, To provide a nice base for the interior trim work, attach another layer of untreated wood on top of the sill plate., The studs are heavier lengths of wood that attach to the porch walls, running vertically from the floor plates to the ceiling plates. As with the plates, nails can be used to affix the studs to a wooden structure, while a masonry nail gun or masonry screws are necessary to secure the studs to brick or other types of masonry walls.

, Be sure to check the width of your screens. Most screens are three feet wide, so space your studs three feet apart, measuring from the center. Important: For door frames, use two wall studs on each side of the door. One for attaching the screen, and one for the door hinges.

, These are the horizontal pieces that help to provide stability to the overall frame. Use the measuring tape, chalk line, and level to make sure the rails and balusters are positioned properly before securing the pieces in place with the hammer and nails.

, Each individual frame piece needs to be screwed (or nailed) together. Make sure you attach the balusters to the rest of the frame to allow for maximum stability.


Once the rails and balusters are firmly affixed to the sole plates and wall studs, the frame is complete.

, Cut sections of screening to fill in the spaces within the framework. Make sure to leave a little excess to allow room for error.

, Begin at the top middle of the opening, and secure the screen using the staple gun. Working toward the outer area of the space, smooth the screen and staple at regular intervals. Make sure that the screening lays flat and is stretched taut as you go.


Once the top is secured, staple the sides and bottom, always stretching the screen to make sure it remains taut. Continue until the screen is firmly in place across the expanse of the framework.

, Using a utility knife, trim off the extra edges of the screening material, outside of the the staples.


You might consider using more durable screening material on the bottom part of the screen, especially if you have pets who might rub up against the screen or scratch it with their claws.

, Use wood strips to hide the stapling along the frame, providing a more finished appearance. Consider attaching the strips using wood screws, since this will make it easier to remove the strips and replace a section of torn screen if necessary.

, Consider painting or staining the visible wood of the porch (especially the pieces you just added) to match the rest of the house so that the color scheme flows seamlessly into the new porch addition.

, Make sure you clean up the mess that inevitably accumulates during a project like this. Sweep the floor and return any plants or furniture that you previously removed. Then stand back and admire your handiwork!

Let the deck sealer dry for at least a day before walking on it.

",How to Seal a Deck,"


If the water beads up on the surface of your deck, you don't need to seal. If the water seeps into the wood, you need to seal. A deck that traps water will bend, warp and ultimately weaken.





;
, Most sealers will work for any wood.

,,


If you do not have a very clean deck before sealing, the deck sealer will trap in all the elements you want removed, and your problem will be exacerbated. Remember to clear any plant or anything else that could be hurt by deck sealer.

,,, Use even strokes, making sure not to allow sealer to collect anywhere. Move out from the corner in such a way that you can apply sealer to the whole deck without stepping in it.

, The entire deck should be covered in an even coat of a single color.

For 29-gauge metal roofing, spacing can be up to 30 inches between centers.
Nail the lathing securely, with a minimum of two nails at each rafter, being careful to keep them aligned.

,


Typically, a lean-to roof will lay at a different pitch than your existing roof.
The lean-to's roofing will need to fit fairly snugly underneath the existing roof to prevent rain from blowing into your addition. You may need to install metal flashing to help ensure water proof joining of the two roof pitches.

, Some roof metal profiles have a ""direction of run,"" so that the laps fit correctly to guarantee a good, weatherproof roof system.

, Wood screw threaded hex screws with neoprene gaskets are ideal.

, Use a piece of break metal configured in the right dimensions to provide a decent finished appearance to these areas. The metal should also close any gaps between the lathing strips and the roofing so that water will not blow in through them.

This partition was created by installing steel stud purlins between one of the outboard support posts and a nailer fastened vertically to the existing shed wall.


, Choose a pre-framed exterior door to make the job simple. You will still need to install some kind of framing yourself.

You can damage the wood if it's turned up too high. Usually 1500-2500 PSI is adequate for pressure treated lumber. Stay between 1200-1500 PSI for cedar and redwood.;
, Most coatings require that the wood should be dry before application. There are exceptions. Thompson's Water Seal Advanced Wood Protectors can be applied to damp lumber, so it's possible to clean and waterproof your deck in one day. Read the directions on the product you're using for temperature and weather guidelines, drying times, etc., and follow them!

, You can use an oil base or water base sealer or stain, solid or semi-transparent. The best method for applying the material is with a brush or a paint pad on a long handle, available at any hardware store. Most materials can be sprayed also, but you will end up needing a lot more product this way. For a large deck, spraying will save time but you should brush the material into the wood. This will help with uniformity and provide a better looking job.

First assess whether your under-surface is poured concrete, mortared concrete block, or block with some kind of coating over it such as stucco.,
If you've got mortared block or block with a coated or stuccoed surface, mechanical paint removal methods could seriously damage your walls, so are not recommended.

,
Next, determine whether the paint is adhering well, or it is bubbling, peeling, or flaking.,
If you don't have concerns about damaging your walls or concrete floor, old paint can be powered off with a pressure washer or sand blaster.,
Once you can see the underlying surface of your wall/floor, you can determine whether old paint failed due to some sealant or other priming issues on your concrete surface.,
If the area you're dealing with is not huge, and especially if the old paint is adhering well to the concrete, you may opt for chemical removal.,
Chemical removal of paint from concrete or stone requires an acid.,
Apply the acid directly from the bottle with a sponge or cloth.,
Whichever paint removal method you use, capture the scrapings or rinsed off paint residue for proper disposal.

,
If you suspect that the paint residue contains lead, contact your local trash collection authorities before you start your project for information on proper handling and disposal.",How to Remove Paint from a Concrete Porch," Poured concrete can stand up relatively well to mechanical cleaning methods such as sand blasting, pressure washing, or scraping. The aesthetic of poured concrete may be the look you're after, so read on.;
,, Paint showing poor adhesion can be scraped off by hand using a metal paint scraper and wire brush. Hand scraping and wire brushing is the safest way to go. If paint is loose, this method is easy but tedious. If you don't think you've got the patience, buy a dozen scrapers and wire brushes and invite a group of friends willing to pitch in for an all day porch scraping party. Have safety masks for everybody to avoid breathing any paint particles.

, If you don't already own a pressure washer or sand blaster, you can rent these from local tool rental stores or your nearest big box home supply store. Start early and you should be able to complete a porch in one day. Carefully follow the directions that come with the power tool you've rented. Use eye protection and take care never to aim pressurized sand or water at your own feet, your pets, or anyone else. If you have neighbors located close to your porch, take into consideration that particles and overspray could drift their way.

, More importantly, you can determine whether there has been water seepage or some other problem that damaged the old paint and should be corrected.

, Chemical cleaning may be your best option if the paint you're removing is not a full coat but only a paint spill or splatter spotting that hasn't come off when you scraped or wired brushed it.

, The most effective is formic acid. Formic acid has been distilled for centuries from the venom of stinging ants. Don't inhale the fumes. Prolonged exposure to the fumes can damage your optic nerves. Using formic acid in an open, ventilated area such as a porch should not cause any problems, as long as you protect yourself with rubber gloves, long sleeves and pants, eye protection against splashing, and a breathing mask.

, Allow it to remain on the paint long enough to dissolve the paint. How long can vary depending on how old and hard the paint is. When the paint is soft, you can pry it of with a hand scraper and wire brush, then rinse with fresh water. On a porch, you can accomplish this with your garden hose.

,, If you suspect the paint contains lead, local laws may require you to hire a pro for this project, so check before you start.

,









Check between the boards to make sure there are not small rocks, sticks or other items in the way.

, These areas will need to be sanded before the deck is stained to make them smooth and bring out a brighter shine.









Sand in the direction of the grain. Use a pole sander, which allows you to stand while you sand, or get on your knees and sand with a hand sander.

, Cleanser can be found at hardware stores, home improvement retailers or department stores.









Follow the directions on the deck cleaner you choose to use. Some will require you to wet the deck before washing it, others will want you to apply the product directly to the wood.
Allow the cleaner to soak into the deck according to the instructions. Rinse the deck after cleaning it if necessary.

, Usually this will take about 2 days.

, Bleach/water mixtures are very inexpensive but they aren’t environmentally friendly and will only clean surface stains. For more effective cleaning, consider the Infinity Wood Cleaner which uses oxygen to lift stains to the surface and offer a safe, effective wood cleaning solution.

, Wood brighteners, like the Infinity Wood Brightener, offer several benefits:


They restore the PH of the wood and bring it back to a neutral state.
They open up the pores of the wood to allow for better sealer absorption.
They open up the pores of the wood to almost double the penetration depth of a sealer.

, Oil based sealers have been proven to penetrate deeper than water based sealers.

A broom and a hose or power washer
Cleaning agent, such as trisodium phosphate
A bucket and water
A stiff-bristle brush with synthetic bristles
Soap and water to remove mildew
A paint brush, tray, and roller
Sandpaper
Painter’s tape
A waterproof deck finish
Rubber gloves and protective clothing;
, Unless your deck is less than a year old, a clear or fully transparent stain or sealer is not recommended.For a natural wood look that still hides knots and grain pattern, choose a semi-transparent stain. To cover the wood completely and hide its natural color and grain patterns, choose a solid stain instead.An oil-based stain or sealer will penetrate the wood deeper and last longer, but a water-based product will be easier to clean.It’s also best to choose a stain that provides:


A waterproof finish (not just water-resistant) to protect it from the elements.
UV-resistance to protect it from the damaging rays of the sun.
Protection from water damage (it will contain a mildewcide).Insecticide if your home is prone to wood-eating bugs., Although most deck sealants are safe for plants, it’s better to protect nearby foliage from cleaner and paint run-off.You can either buy large sheets of plastic or cut open plastic garbage bags, but make sure you cover up nearby plants before you move on to the next stages.

, Move tables, chairs, umbrellas, carpets, barbecues, and anything else you might have on the deck. Clear the surface of the deck completely, as well as the railings and steps. This may include removing lights, plants, and other items as well.


Before emptying your deck, you might want to clear a space below, in the garage, or in the basement where you can store your deck furniture for a few days while your refinishing project is underway.

, Sweep to remove dust, dirt, and other debris completely. As you sweep, do a visual check of the deck, looking for problem areas such as popped nails, loose screws, warped, rotted, or split boards, chips, or areas that require sanding.Sand down any areas where splintered wood way cause slivers.
Tighten down loose screws and hammer down popped nails.Replace single boards that have split or broken.

, Apply painter’s tape to any areas of the deck that adjoin the house, concrete, or other non-deck surfaces to protect them from splashing cleaner and paint.

, Spring is a good time for a refinishing project, but if you attempt this in the summer, you are better off applying sealer or stain in the early morning or late afternoon. You don’t want to be refinishing your deck if the temperature is going to drop below 50 F (10 C) or soar above 95 F (35 C).Don’t try to refinish the deck on a sunny day, as applying your refinishing product in direct sunlight will make it dry too quickly, which will cause lap marks, and prevent the stain from absorbing into the wood properly.
You should also have a look at the long-range forecast to help choose a day when it won’t be raining.

, In a large bucket, dilute one cup (8 ounces) of trisodium phosphate in one gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Use the brush to scrub the railings and stairs with the water and trisodium phosphate solution. Attach your stiff-bristle brush to the long handle and continue scrubbing the entire surface of the deck.


Scrubbing will clean off dirt, mold and mildew, old paint or stain, and grime. It will also help open the pores in the wood so that your finish will penetrate more deeply.
Be sure to wear rubber gloves and safety equipment when working with heavy-duty cleaners.
It is generally not necessary to actively strip old stain or sealer from a deck., Once you’ve scrubbed the entire deck, use your garden hose to rinse it off well. A power washer isn’t necessary at this stage, but if you do want to use one, avoid areas that have sustained damage from the elements,keep the nozzle 12 inches or farther from the surface, and don’t linger on a single spot for too long.Concentrate your pressure washer use in the corners and areas where it was difficult to reach when you were scrubbing., If you are using a water-based stain or sealer, you can apply the product when the deck is still damp. However, if you chose an oil-based stain, you will have to wait two to three daysuntil the deck has dried completely before you can proceed with the refinishing., Pour your refinishing product into the paint tray. Dip in your paint brush a few times to saturate it, gently brush off the excess, and begin refinishing your deck, starting with the railings.Don’t apply an overly thick coat, and brush away any pools immediately.

, When you’re ready to start painting the deck surface, attach the roller to your roller frame, and attach the roller frame to your long handle. Soak your roller in an even coating of stain and roll off the excess. Dip the roller back in the tray as needed.


Start in an inside corner closest to the house if possible, and apply the stain parallel to the boards (in the direction of the wood grain).Work your way toward the stairs, and then refinish the stairs starting at the top and working your way down.
Use a brush for delicate areas along the house or near other edges where you don’t want to paint the adjoining surface.

, To prevent some areas from getting more stain and being darker than others, only work on a few boards at a time, and cover the entire length of those boards before moving over.Also make sure that when you stop to get more paint on the roller, you don’t take so long that your edge has time to dry.

, Check the can and follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding wait time between applying coats. Once you’ve waited the allotted time, apply your next coat according to the same process.


Note that some products have to be applied while the first coat is still slightly wet in order to absorb into the wood properly., Check the manufacturer’s instructions for exact time, but most will recommend waiting two or more days before replacing furniture and walking on the deck again.

Remove excess caulk.",How to Paint Porch Railings1," Try to drape them over concrete, furniture, plants and even soil so that you can pick up paint chips or rust at the end of the preparation process by folding up the cloth or plastic sheet.;
, Brushing and sanding expels fine dust, dirt and harmful materials in the air.

, Stay a few feet from the rails when using the washer to avoid damaging the rails.

, Depending upon the type of porch railing you own, specifically plastic or metal, you will use a slightly different process.


For metal railings, start by using a wire brush to remove rust over all the railing's surfaces. If you have ornate metal railings or hard to remove rust, find a wire brush attachment for your power drill and apply it to your railings.






For wooden railings, use a wire brush and metal scraper to remove paint from the surface. Try to work with the grain of the wood rather than against it to avoid damaging the surface grain.






For either surface, place a large shop vacuum nearby to suck up falling debris and improve the ease of cleanup.







, 80 grit sandpaper is good for either metal or wood railings. Make sure to get all surfaces of the railings while scuff sanding.

, Rub the surface of the railings with tack cloth to remove tiny bits of debris.

, Ask a clerk at the hardware store to suggest a good wood caulk for exterior use. After applying caulk with a drip-free gun, use a moist towel to smooth the caulk into the gaps.


Wooden railings that have been improperly painted or painted long ago may be loose and have gaps between the spindles and railings. These gaps allow moisture to leak into the wood, ruin the paint job and degrade the wood.







, Allow the caulk to dry for at least 24 hours, or according to package directions, before continuing.


You can use a polyurethane caulk to connect wooden railings to concrete. Be careful to use a light squeeze because it is harder to remove. Smooth it over with a moist towel mixed with a small amount of dish soap.

Look at the posts and joists.",How to Safety Check Your Deck1," Look all across the deck for damaged boards, particularly in areas where water gathers. Take an ice pick or screwdriver and push the tip into the wood. If the wood feels soft, splinters, or is easily penetrated, it is rotting and needs to be replaced.Also be aware of insect holes that reduce the integrity of the boards.;
, Flashing is waterproof material, often metal, rising up from where your deck meets your house. Check to see that the flashing goes at least four inches (10.16 cm) up the wall and the caulking attaching it is holding. Look for any signs of mud, debris, water, or rot breaching the flashing.If the flashing is breached, it needs to be replaced or else the deck will begin to rot.

, Press against the railings and bannisters to see that they feel secure rather than loose. Follow up by inspecting the rail sections. Their fasteners should also be secure and placed no more than four inches (10.16 cm) apart. Look for signs of rotting or rusting., If you can see and reach the support posts of the deck, check them for rot, cracks, insect holes, or other damage. The joists are the crossbeams on the weight-bearing posts and need to be examined the same way."

Understand what causes mold to grow on a deck so you can avoid deck mold.,
Build your deck, and keep in mind that you're preventing deck mold from occurring.,
Sweep regularly to remove mold spores from a deck.,
Regularly power wash your deck with a strong sprayer to prevent deck mold spores.

",How to Prevent Mold on a Deck,"


Mold thrives in dampness.






Mold needs food, such as pollen and dirt, to survive.






Mold enjoys temperate weather, although mold spores can stay dormant through extreme weather situations, such as drought or frost.






Mold likes shady areas away from direct sun.





;
,


Build with a composite material that has mold inhibitors in its construction. Wood is very agreeable to mold spores, and decks built out of wood often suffer from mold problems.






Ultraviolet rays from sunlight will kill mold spores, so you may want to build a deck where there is adequate sunlight. You may also want to cut back as many trees around the deck area as possible.






Slope the deck away from the house so that it drains well. Slope should be 1/8 inch (.32 cm) for every 8 feet (2.44 m) of deck.






Gap the decking material at least 1/8 inch (.32 cm) for adequate draining.







, Sweeping will also remove food needed for the spores to grow, such as pollen or dirt, as well as any dormant spores.

Prime your railings before painting.,
Apply your finish coat of paint.,
Allow the coat to dry and apply another coat of paint, if your railings were well worn.,
Block off your railings and allow them to dry for a few days before using.

",How to Paint Porch Railings2," If you are painting metal railings, get a primer with a rust inhibitor. Otherwise, consult with a hardware store clerk about the best kind of outdoor primer for your project.


Use a small, 3 to 5 inch (7.6 to 12.7 cm), roller to apply the primer on the spindles if they are small but square. If your railings are ornate, you will need to use a wire or sponge brush.






Make sure to coat well in 1 direction. Do not leave any excess paint, because you will be able to see priming strokes through the finish coat of paint.






Allow the primer to dry according to package directions.







, Use careful strokes in the same direction. Buy a brush that is well sized to your railings to avoid drips from the application of too much paint.

, This will increase the durability of your paint job.


For intricate metal railings, you may choose to apply paint with a paint sprayer. Try to get a small paint sprayer that will reach into crevices. Set up a cardboard shield, if possible, to avoid spraying grass or walls.

Check the ledger board.,
Examine all fasteners.,
Inspect the staircases.",How to Safety Check Your Deck2," The ledger board connects the deck to the house. It bears the deck’s weight. You may need to go under the deck to get a good look at it. Make sure the board is secure to the house. If the screws and bolts are loose or the board is separated, tighten the bolts.The board needs to be held by ½-inch (12.7 mm) steel screws and bolts rather than nails. Nails are not strong enough.

, Look once over all screws, bolts, and plating that holds the pieces of the deck together. Go back and reexamine any that you skipped. Look for signs of rust, warping, separation, or locations where the deck is held only by nails and make repairs so the deck holds strong.Steel screws and bolts are most resistant to water but will rust eventually.
Nails alone are not strong enough to hold together a deck and should be supplemented with other fasteners.

, If your deck has a staircase, walk up and down it. Press on the railings to see if they feel stable. The staircase should not wobble. Repair any damaged wood pieces and bolts."
"
Remove debris.,
Clean deck stains.,
Apply a waterproof coating.,
Test lighting fixtures.,
Trim trees.",How to Safety Check Your Deck3," Sweep off any branches, leaves, or other debris. Organic material collects water and decays when left in place, creating growing places for mold and other substances that can degrade the deck. Remove the debris as quickly as possible.

, Use a cleaning solution to remove stains and prevent wear and tear. Use a paint roller, hose, or broom to evenly apply a store-bought cleaner. Apply hydrogen peroxide the same way to remove mold.Don’t use a pressure washer, as this can abrade the wood.
Substitute bleach for oxygenated bleach or hydrogen peroxide to limit damage to the wood.
Water your plants before and after cleaning and cover them with plastic.

, Mold setting in or your last coating running thin are both signs you need to apply a new coat of sealant. On a dry day, use a paint roller to apply two thin coats of a deck sealant from a home improvement store. Switch to a paint brush to reach smaller areas.Spray nearby plants with water before and after you finish and coat them with plastic to ensure the sealant doesn’t damage them.

, Look at any cords for your deck’s lighting fixtures. Check for exposed wires that pose a fire hazard. Turn on the lights to make sure they work. Clean off any lighting elements with soap and water.

, During your inspection, look up. Overhanging vegetation drops branches that can fall on someone or the deck. The shade and the plant matter left behind also promotes mold."

Even if you end up having to remove it yourself, advertising free fence material is a great way to dispose of unwanted items without having to use a truck yourself or pay a disposal fee.;
, The goal is to have a flat place on the ground on one side of the fence—preferably on the side opposite the top rail—to lay the fence fabric down flat so it can be rolled up. This should be at least 2 feet (61 cm) wider than the fence fabric is tall. If this space is not available, you can roll it up in smaller sections while its still attached to the fence, but you'll still need at least 2 to 3 clear feet (61 to 91.4 cm) of space.


If possible, clear a pathway for a truck or at least a handcart to reach the fence. This is important for both convenience and safety, since the rolled up chain link will be extremely heavy and difficult to work with.

, Tie up or trim nearby bushes and trees you want to preserve, or cover smaller desirable plants with an inverted bucket.


If a tree you want to keep has grown through the fence, there's no need to remove it. You can plan to cut the fence on either side of the tree.

, Chain link removal can scratch you up and sometimes send small pieces of metal flying. Wear thick gloves, eye protection, and a long sleeve shirt and trousers.

, The post in this position is generally wider in diameter than the other posts. The fence fabric will be attached to it by a thin, flat piece of metal called a tension bar that is woven through the fence fabric and attached by clamps to the post.

, The clamps are generally attached with a bolt and nut. Loosen the nut with a wrench and pull the bolt out. Pull the clamps off the fence post. The fence will slacken, but shouldn't fall.

, Weave the metal bar out from the chain link. Save your hardware and the metal bar in a safe place, keeping the ground clear.

, You can eyeball this if you don't have a measuring tape, since posts are typically set 10 feet (3 m) apart. The important part is to choose a section that can easily be rolled up and handled in the space you have available. Use these guidelines to decide on a length, then mark the end of the first section using a piece of colored tape or a knot of colored string.


If you're working in an open, flat area, have an assistant, and are used to manual labor, you can remove the fence in 50 foot (15.24 m) sections.
If you are working alone, or if you're not able to lift much, or if there are obstacles in the area, keep the sections no more than 20 feet (6 m) or so each.
If you're in a narrow area with no ground space, you'll have to roll the fence vertically, and cut it frequently before it becomes too bulky to handle.

, Fence ties are pieces of wire attaching the fence fabric to the top rail and posts. You can purchase specialized ""fence pliers"" or ""wire grippers"" for this purpose, but most fence ties can be bent back with ordinary heavy pliers or a vise grip.Read the step below before you remove more than a few fence ties.


Store the ties in a container as you remove them so they don’t become hazards for people and lawn mowers.
Cutting the ties with bolt cutters is another option, but the creation of sharp wire edges makes this method less than ideal.

, As you remove the fence ties, lay the chain fence fabric flat on the ground, without rolling it up. If you do not have the space to do this, you'll have to use a more tedious method instead:


Loosen a few fence ties at a time.
Roll the loose fence, then attach the roll to the top rail with a bungee cord or a piece of wire so it stays upright. Taking extra time and care to secure the roll using strong ties will make it easier for you to handle the fencing, and will ultimately save you time.
Repeat until the marked section is rolled up along the fence.

, Stop cutting fence ties when you get to the end of the section you're removing. Follow these steps to detach the chain link you've pulled off from the rest of the fence:


Find a wire forming part of the chain link at the top of the fence, just before the post, and unbend the hook it makes over the next wire with your pliers. Straighten the hook out.
Follow that piece of wire down to the bottom of the fence and unbend it, so it no longer hooks over the next wire.
Beginning at the top, grab the straightened wire with gloved hands and twist it around, removing it from the fence as you go. The wire should move upward in a spiral, until the two fence sections are separated.

, Roll up the fence section you've laid on the ground, and tie it securely with wire or rope so it won’t unwind. Move it out of your way.

, Continue marking sections and removing the fence fabric as described above. Once all the fabric is gone, move on to the more difficult part: removing the metal rail and poles.

, Once the chain fence fabric is removed, work on the metal bar running along the top of the fence. Here are several common ways this rail can be attached, and how to remove it:If the rail is fastened to a ""cap"" at the top of a corner or end post, loosen the nut and remove the bolt holding the rail and one cap together.
The top rail is often made from hollow 10 feet (3 m) lengths of pole. Once the end is detached, twist the lengths of rail apart at each attachment point and slide them apart. In some cases, these sections of top rail will not come apart easily, or at all. If you are unable to separate them by hand, you may need to cut them apart. You can do this with a reciprocating saw, hand grinder, metal abrasive wheel, or hand hacksaw. Make sure the tool you choose has a metal-cutting blade.
If the rail is welded, put on a face shield and cut it into manageable segments with a reciprocating saw. Attach a metal-cutting blade, ideally one with roughly 18 teeth per inch (or 1.41mm pitch)., Remove the remaining caps from the post tops and store with the other hardware.

, Chain link fence posts are almost always embedded in concrete, making removal a major operation. If the concrete base is buried, use a shovel to dig down until it is exposed.


Start with the middle posts first. End posts and corner posts are usually more difficult to remove, due to larger concrete bases., Loosen the dirt and concrete by soaking the base of the post with water., Dig a hole next to the concrete, and push the fence post back and forth until the concrete base falls into the hole. This is the tidiest way to remove the post, but it may not be feasible for large concrete bases, or for fences installed over asphalt or other hard surfaces. For best results, you will have to dig around the entire circumference of the post and concrete base.

, Large fence posts often can't be removed by hand. Use one of these methods to apply more force:


Rent a post puller from a heavy equipment rental company. Attach it to the post with a chain and push down on the lever to lift the pole vertically.
Use a chain to hitch the post to a tractor or truck. Run the chain over a stable object standing next to the post, so the post is pulled vertically instead of sideways.Clear the area of people, as the post may go flying once removed.
You can also use a farm jack to remove posts. Wrap a length of chain around the fence post, and secure the other end to the lifting plate on the jack. Then jack the post out of the ground.

, If the methods above don't work, attempt to loosen the post from the concrete. Have a strong person push and pull a fence post repeatedly, or hit it near the base with a sledgehammer. Torque is sometimes more effective than direct pushing, so try gripping the post with a large pipe wrench or vise and turning.Once the post turns or moves, repeat the pulling step above to remove just the metal post, then dig out or fill the concrete base afterward.

, This is not an ideal solution, as you'll end up with potentially dangerous, jagged metal bases left over. If nothing can budge the fence post, however, this may be the last ""DIY"" option available. Use an angle grinder or reciprocating saw, with a metal-cutting blade.


Always wear eye protection when sawing through metal.
Once the post is cut, make the area safe by crimping the metal edges, or at least covering it with a planter or other large object.
Flatten out the rough edges with a small (3-5 lb or 1.4-2.3 kg) hand sledge hammer.
If possible, dig down a bit and make your cut below the surface of the ground. Once you have cut the post and flattened the rough edges, cover the cut end of the post with soil.

, Once the fence post is removed, get rid of the concrete before disposing of the metal. Rent a small, electric jackhammer from an equipment rental company, and carefully break up the outer edge of the concrete base. Once the cracks have made it to the fence post base, use a hammer and chisel to remove the concrete immediately around the fence post. You can also break up the concrete with a heavy (10-12 lb or 4.5-5.4 kg) sledgehammer.


Eye protection, hearing protection, thick gloves, and steel-toed boots are recommended."

Create a lever to help extract the post.,
Attach the rope to the end of the board closest to the post.,
Stand on the opposite end of the board.,
Remove the post from the hole.",How to Remove Fence Posts1," A wooden post that is sunk into the surrounding soil will be relatively easy to remove, while one that is sunk into concrete will require additional equipment. Any wooden fence post that is severely deteriorated may also require additional tools to manage the extraction.;
, The trench does not have to be any deeper than about 1 foot (0.3 m). Remove the dirt directly around the post, or around the concrete plug that is holding the post in position.


Wear eye protection when digging around concrete, to protect against chipped concrete fragments.

, Watering the soil around the post will loosen it and make it easier to remove the post.

, Push it backward and forward several times to help loosen the post and plug as the hole is enlarged slightly. Try not to break the post.

, Drive four nails into each face of the post. Position the nails so they are driven into the surface of the post at roughly 1 foot (0.3 m) from the ground level. Make sure the nails are driven at least halfway into the wood, creating a firm hold.

, Secure a length of strong rope to the series of nails on the post. This can be accomplished by wrapping the rope around and under each exposed nail head in succession, finally tying the rope tightly around the body of the fence post.

, This can be accomplished by placing one to two layers of concrete blocks on one side of the trench, and then laying a thick plank or board across the blocks.

, Drive a couple of nails into the board to create a means of securing the rope into position.

, The effect will be somewhat like a seesaw, in that as your end moves toward the ground, the tension on the rope increases and pulls the post upward, slowly extracting the buried portion of the post.

, Once the post is pulled upward, detach the rope and move the post away from the open hole.

Pour concrete into the trench.,
Let the concrete cure.,
Fill the trench with gravel.",How to Make a Fence Gate1," If you do not have an existing fence to attach the gate to, you will need to build one, as fence posts are necessary for installing a fence.;
, If you do not already have fence posts in place, you will need posts in order to install a gate. Make small indentations in the ground with your trowel.

, Before any digging takes place, call a utility location service to locate pipes, cables, and other underground hazards. You can call the toll-free number ""811"" for this service from anywhere in the US and Canada.

, If the fence is not yet built, you can build it in an ""H-brace"" style, with single crossbeams and horizontal tensioned wires connecting the posts. For the gate posts, use posts 1.5 to 2 times the diameter of the other fence posts, and attach them to the nearest fence post using a tensioned wire strung diagonally from the bottom of the gate post to the top of the other post., If you are not building an H-brace fence, you can reinforce the gate posts with a concrete base instead. Begin by digging a trench 12"" (30 cm) wide across the gate opening, and at least 18"" (46 cm) deep.

, Place the two gate posts in opposite ends of the trench. Plumb them with a bubble level to make sure they are as vertical as possible. Brace them in place by nailing two angled 2 x 4s onto adjacent sides of each post, stabilizing them against the ground., For additional stability, you can lay pressure treated 2"" x 4"" boards across the entire length of the trench base. Nail them to the sides of the two posts.

, A fast-setting concrete mix or any basic Portland cement mix will do. You'll need roughly one bag per post.

, Cover the entire base of the trench with a layer of concrete 4–6"" (10–15 cm) deep.

, Wait at least 24 hours for the concrete to cure, or as directed on the bag.

, Pour gravel to ground level to further reinforce the posts.

Apply a rust-inhibitive primer to the entire wrought iron surface.,
Allow the primer to dry fully per the manufacturer's instructions.,
Apply an exterior rust-inhibitive enamel paint over the fully cured primer.",How to Prepare a Wrought Iron Fence for Painting," The first step is to remove any old paint or rust. This can be done either by manually sanding, using a sand blaster or paint and rust remover. Remove the old paint instead of trying to paint over it. This prevents the new paint from chipping and peeling.;
, This will remove any chipped or peeling paint and will provide a rough surface for the paint to adhere to. It will also remove any deteriorating paint if you used a drill and wire wheel attachment for the previous step.

,, Take special care to protect steps, windows and plants. Dampen the greenery in flower beds or landscape gardens with a light mist of water before covering them.

, Made-for-metal primers come in liquid and aerosol form and can be found in most hardware stores. An aerosol primer is the better choice for thorough coverage if your fence has intricate scroll work.

, Typically, most direct-to-metal primers will require 1-to-3 hours of curing time.

, Again, the paint will come in either liquid or aerosol form, so choose the type that is appropriate for your project. If using aerosol paint, hold the can approximately 3-to-4 inches (10.2 cm) away from the fence to reduce drips.

Lay a thick block across the hole.,
Wrap a chain around the post.,
Secure the chain to the jack.,
Operate the jack.",How to Remove Fence Posts2," If the fence post has a large concrete base or is very firmly anchored in soil, you may need to use a farm jack (Hi-Lift jack) and chain to pull it out. To prepare for this, dig out the soil around the post to a depth of 1 to 1½ feet (0.3 to 0.46 meters). A posthole digger will make this easier.

, Use a pointed digging bar or rock bar to further loosen the soil, or to break up the concrete if possible. Wear eye protection to protect against flying concrete fragments.

, Use a block at least 4 inches (10 cm) thick, with a flat top that can support your jack. Place it across the hole next to the base of the post. Position the block securely so it will not shift during construction. Make sure it is located far enough from the post that the concrete base will not strike the block on its way up.

, Wrap a 3 to 5 foot (0.9 to 1.5 m) length of chain several times around the post, as low to the ground as possible.

, Place the jack on top of the block. Loop the chain tightly around the jack's runner and secure it in place.

, Put on a pair of heavy leather gloves and stand to the side of the jack's handle. Operate the jack to lift the chain and gradually tug the fence post up and out of the ground.

Cut top and bottom gate boards.,
Cut two 2"" x 4"" boards to the desired height of your gate.,
Form the gate frame.,
Add slats or pickets.",How to Make a Fence Gate2," Cut two 2"" x 4"" boards to 2 in. (or 4 cm) shorter than the distance between the posts. For example, if you want a gate that spans 36 in. (or 92 cm), cut the boards to 34 in. (or 88 cm).


You can replace the 2"" x 4""s with any 1"" or 2"" thick boards with a width that matches the rest of the fence. The thicker the board, the better, to make the gate sturdy and durable.

, These will be your vertical boards.

, Place the four boards flat on the table to form a rectangle. Hammer them together so that the vertical boards rest inside the horizontal boards. If your gate is very tall, a center brace beam may also be necessary.


For a sturdier gate, add a diagonal brace across the square. Instead of nailing the boards together, drill holes and connect them with carriage bolts.

, Nail boards of your desired width, no more than 1” thick, to the outside of the fence gate, using 2” screws or nails driven into the top and bottom pieces. These can be butted against each other or spaced evening or unevenly, depending on your preferred look.

"
"
Secure one side of the hinges onto one of the fence posts.,
Attach the gate in a level position.,
Test the gate.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Fence Gate3," Usually, simply screwing the hinges into the fence post will suffice.

, Use a bubble level across the top of gate to confirm it will be perfectly horizontal once attached. If the hinge placement does not need adjusting, screw the hinges onto one of the vertical boards of your gate.


If your gate has a diagonal brace, the lower side of the brace should be next to the hinges.

, Test your homemade gate by swinging it back and forth several times, watching for drag on the ground or wobbliness in the posts.


You can in install a heavy spring so the gate closes automatically, as with a screen door.

Clear and cover the area surrounding the fence.,
Remove old screws and nails.,
Sand rough areas.,
Wash your fence.",How to Paint a Wood Fence1," Before attempting to paint, clear the surrounding area. Mow the grass near the fence. If shrubs grow nearby, place a piece of plywood between them and the fence. When you're done, lay a large tarp over the surrounding ground., Check the fence for any loose nails or screws. Use a hammer or similar tool to pry away loose nails and screws from the fence. These will get in the way of your painting.You should also remove any decorations from the fence at this point, and the nails or screws hanging them up. You can add new screws and nails when you finish painting.

, If there are any rough areas with splinters sticking out, sand them down. Get your fence as smooth as possible, as this will make it easier to paint.Garnet sand paper works best for sanding wood., Use a fence cleaner to wipe down your fence with a rag, spray cleaner, or a sturdy brush. Remove any dirt and debris from your fence, as well as substances like algae or lichen.Refer to your fence cleaner's instructions to figure out how much to use and whether or not you need to dilute the cleaner.
Make sure you choose a fence cleaner that is safe for wooden fences.

Drive stakes into the ground using a mallet where you want the stacked fence to begin, where you want the fence to end and at any corners.,
Lay out the heaviest rails along the twine pathway you set up.,
Stack rails on the outline of the fence 1 layer at a time maintaining the lines and angles as evenly as possible.

,
Wedge a rail upright as a fence pole on either side of each angle after the 3rd layer of split rails.,
Stack more layers of rails until you reach your desired height, usually 4 to 6 layers.

,
Wrap wire around the bottoms of both fence poles at each angle, and use pliers to twist the ends of the wire until it bites into the wood.,
Clip the excess wire ends using wire cutters.

",How to Install Split Rail Fence," Connect the stakes using twine so that you can clearly see the length and path the fence is to take.;
,


Arrange the split rails in a zigzag pattern with the rails meeting at an angle between 60 degrees and 120 degrees -- the smaller the angle, the stronger the stacked fence.
Place the first end of the first split rail on a stable rock to avoid rot and the second end on another rock situated according to creating the proper angle.
Position the first end of the next split rail on top of the second end of the previous split rail so that there is at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) of overlap from both rails. Then place the second end of this rail on a rock.
Set out the first layer of split rails until you have the whole bottom of the stacked fence outlined.

,, This will help with keeping the angles the same.

,, Do the same at the top of each set of poles.

Prepare to remove the rust from the wrought iron fence.,
Take a durable steel brush, steel wool, or high grit sandpaper and start removing the rust.,
Wash the fence with mineral spirits.,
Rinse with water.,
Prime the fence.,
Let the primer dry.,
Make sure you have a paint that is strictly for metal surfaces.,
Paint the fence.",How to Paint a Wrought Iron Fence," A big reason for removing the rust is to make sure the primer can be absorbed into the wrought iron fence.


Take a good look at the fence for any signs of rust. If rust is present then you need to remove it properly. Make sure that you protect yourself by wearing gloves, protective glasses and a mask to protect yourself from the particles released while removing the rust.;
, Now this part of the task can be very time consuming but, this must be done for a proper wrought iron fence painting. Once you're done removing the rust, you can take some lighter grain sandpaper to smooth out any left over rough areas that remain.

, Once you have removed all of the rust and rough areas we need to wash the fence down properly. This is done with mineral spirits. Mineral spirits helps to get rid of any remaining residue remaining on the fence so wash the wrought iron fence thoroughly with the mineral spirits.

, Go back over the fence with just plain water because your final rinse will remove any mineral spirits remaining on the fence. Mineral spirits can actually cause the wrought iron fence to not absorb the fence properly.

, Find a good metal primer that you can buy at your nearest hardware store. Take the primer and lay down your first coat; this will allow the paint to stick to the fence better and prolong the life of the painting.

, Once the primer is laid down let it sit for about a day or so, we want to make sure it is good and dry before applying the paint.

, All paints are not created equal, some paints are for wood, some for plastic and some for metal or iron.

, Add a couple of coats of paint to the fence. This will allow for a longer life of the wrought iron fence painting.

Regardless of whether you're using the post for a fence or a mailbox, remember that water is the enemy.,
Treat the wood for wood boring insects common to your area (ie termites, powder post beetles, carpenter ants...).,
Using a good wood may help prolong the problem, though it will still eventually rot out if not set in concrete and moisture gets to it.,
If you don't feel comfortable pouring cement, are unable to use insecticides, and can't find a wood you feel confident in, you may consider using a metal post instead.",How to Protect a Wooden Post from Rotting in the Ground," The best way to keep your post from rotting itself out of the ground is to sink it in cement. (Dig a hole, put the post in, pour the cement, smooth the cement, write your name in the cement, have your kid put his hand print in the cement, let it cure.) It's pretty much entombed in there, and it won't rot.;
, A good, historical method for this is the use of creosote. It is used mainly to weatherproof the post, but it is also great for repelling insects. Aside from this, there are many other modern chemicals used for bug-proofing posts. Ask your pest control agency which one would be best for you.

, Here are some different types of wood commonly used for fencing.

Spruce - Untreated spruce picket fences and cross rails are most commonly used in prefabricated 4x8 or 8x6 foot picket and stockade-fence sections that you find at your local hardware store. These are then installed between pressure-treated fence posts.






Pine - Pressure treated for subterranean termites - besides having pressure treated pine, it is good to coat the lumber with water repellent stain to prolong the life of wood.






Cypress - Natural chemical Cypretine - Red Cypress is an all-natural aromatic wood that is grown in the swamps of Florida. Noted for its color consistency, density, hardness and relative lack of knots, cypress is a superior wood.






Cedar and Red Wood - This is the best wood for fencing in or around your house as it is beautiful and has a longer life. But because it is high in demand, it more expensive as well.






The best and most elegant woods for fencing come from evergreens, which are soft woods containing resins that naturally repel molds, termites and other boring insects. The best known is California redwood; heartwood of this tree will last for 25 years or more without treatment.







, Metal is a much more durable material when building a fence or putting up a mailbox post. Although you will probably have to occasionally spray paint it with a product like Rustoleum to keep it from rusting, you will likely never need to replace it.

Choose the right paint.,
Test your paint on a small portion of the fence.,
Apply a layer of primer.,
Paint the fence.,
Fill in any spots you missed.,
Add another layer of paint if necessary.",How to Paint a Wood Fence2," Your fence paint should be safe for exterior use and use on wood. Oil-based paints are generally the most durable for painting a fence. You should also pick up a primer that is safe for outdoor use.A paint's label will indicate how it can be used. Refer to your paint's label when choosing a wood paint.

, Paint a small patch of your paint on a small, unnoticeable portion of your fence. Let it dry overnight and then check the patch of fence. Make sure the paint did not cause any damage. Check how the color dries as well. Make sure you're happy with the color you're getting., Use a paint brush or paint roller to apply primer to all the panels. Use horizontal strokes for horizontal panels and vertical strokes for vertical panels. Allow the primer to dry completely before proceeding.Every primer is different. Check your primer's instruction manual to see how long it will take to dry.

, Use a large paint brush to apply your chosen color. Remember to use horizontal strokes on horizontal panels and vertical strokes on vertical ones. When painting a fence, start at the top and work your way down until each panel is painted.Apply the paint fairly liberally. This will reduce the likelihood of you needing to apply a second coat.
Smooth over paint bubbles or drips with your paint brush as they occur. Painting slower can prevent bubbles and drips.

, When you're done painting, carefully examine your fence. Look for any spots you missed or spots where the paint is thin. Use a paint brush to add more paint where it's needed., If you're using a high quality oil-based paint, you can usually get by with one coat. However, if your paint looks thin, or if the color is not as bright as you wanted, add another coat after the first one dries.Make sure to read your paint's instructions manual for precise drying times. Many paints will need to dry overnight.

"
"
Set up your sprayer.,
Add a layer of primer.,
Spray your fence.,
Give your fence an extra coat if necessary.",How to Paint a Wood Fence3," Each sprayer is different, so read your instruction's manual before starting. Usually, you fill the sprayer's bucket with your chosen paint. You then attach the sprayer pump to this bucket. Sprayers usually come with different nozzles depending on which part of the fence you're painting, so choose the correct nozzle to begin.Unless you're only painting a small portion of the fence, choose the largest nozzle first. As you continue painting and need to get into cracks and crevices, use smaller, more precise nozzles as needed.
Remember to use an oil-based fence that is safe for wood and exterior use.

, Add a layer of primer to your fence using a paint brush. Use horizontal strokes for horizontal panels and vertical strokes for vertical ones. Allow the primer to dry before proceeding. Drying times vary, so refer to your primer's instructions for precise drying times., Keep your nozzle about six to eight inches away from the fence. Use a steady back and forth motion to spray your fence. For horizontal panels, move up and down. For verticals ones, move back and forth.After spraying down one panel, go over your work at a perpendicular line of about 90 degrees. This leaves a crisscross pattern on your fence that eliminates streaks.
Make sure not to make arcs at the ends of each stroke. This will spray paint in unwanted places.

, After your paint dries, examine your fence. Decide whether or not a second coat is necessary. If you chose a quality paint, you can probably get by with a single coat. However, if your paint is a little thin, add an extra coat after the first one dries.Check your paint's instructions to see how long it takes to dry. Most paints need to dry overnight.

, Tamp down the gravel to provide a compact foundation for the posts and concrete.

, Mark the side of the post at ground level using a marker or chalk. The height above the line should equal the height of the fence mesh, plus 2 inches (5.1 cm).

, Using a carpenter's level or plumb line, position the post until its plumb.

, Using clamps and pieces lumber angled into the ground, brace the post in its plumb position.

, Pour or shovel concrete around the post. Smooth the surface with a trowel or small piece of wood, sloping away from the post to direct water elsewhere.

, Allow time for the concrete to set, according to manufacturer's recommendations.

Loosely attach the mesh to the top rail.,
Splice sections together as needed.,
Remove excess mesh.",How to Install Chain Link Fence8," This will stiffen the mesh so that you can attach it to the fence posts and rails.

, The mesh should overlap the rail by 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) and be 2 inches (5.1 cm) off the ground.


You'll need someone to help you stand the mesh up to the end post and a socket wrench to turn the bolt.

, Stand it up against the fence frame, taking out the slack as you go.

, Use fence ties to hold it in place. Separate enough length from the roll to span the opening between the terminal posts.

, Using a single strand of wire removed from one end of the mesh, join two sections by corkscrewing the loose strand through the end links. A second strand may have to be removed to provide the correct line-up of ""diamonds.""

, Using pliers, untwist the top and bottom loops on one strand of wire where you want to separate the mesh. Work the freed strand out of the links until the two sections separate.

Keep shrubs and weeds away from your fence.",How to Install an Electric Fence," How big of an enclosure or barrier do you need to create for your purposes? Consider the number of animals you need to control and determine the spacing and number of wires you need to use to install electric fencing. If you've got a particular plot set aside for your electric enclosure, take careful measurements and decide on an appropriate height for your fence.









Decide on the length of each run, as well as the height and the number of wires necessary to complete the job. Price the wires per foot at your retailer to get the best deal possible.
Different chargers are optimized for different lengths of wire. Check with your supplier to make sure that the charger you intend to get will work with the planned length of wire for your enclosure.;
, Each corner of the electrical fence will need to be braced with a corner piece. 1 brace will suffice at ends and corners with 6 or fewer lines. 7 or more lines require a double brace when putting in fencing.








, You'll need a lot of posts, especially if you're going to lay a fence of substantial size. Wood posts are perfectly durable and effective, though they'll have a tendency to degrade over time, while metal posts are the easiest to set in the ground, but may end up being more expensive.







, To keep the electric fence juiced, you need a charger that will keep electrical current powering the fence wires. Solar charges do not need an electric outlet but they require a certain amount of sunlight, which can be an effective and energy-efficient option in your area. Electric chargers must have access to an AC outlet.









Don't buy chargers with foot or mile power ratings, instead select a charger that's rated by joules. A higher rating in terms of joules doesn't mean that the charge will be stronger if an animal gets jolted, it just means that the electrical current will be more consistent, making a high-joule charger the smartest purchase. If you've got a five acre fence, you'll need at least a joule at the minimum., You can install electric fencing with electric fence tape or a variety of straight wire of various thicknesses. Tape is the easiest to see, and less dangerous than straight wire.









Making sure that the fencing is easy to see is one of the most important considerations. 1.5- or 2-inch poly tape, braid, rope are perfectly effective for most purposes. Coated wire is likewise easy to see and to install. Half inch tape is probably too small for a more substantial fence, especially for horses or keeping deer out.

, Look for a weather-resilient spot near an AC outlet to install an electric charger, or an area that receives plenty of sunlight for a solar charger.









To keep the charger protected, hang the charger on a post or wall of an outbuilding. Do not turn the charger on until you've installed the fence.

, To install electric fencing, you need at least 1 grounding post that is 6 feet (1.8 m) (182.88 cm) or longer. Place 1 grounding rod near the charger and use a post-hole digger/slammer to set the grounding post. Leave at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) of the post above the ground. When installing electric fencing, it's a good idea to set another grounding post 10 feet (304.80 cm) to 20 feet (6.1 m) (609.60 cm) from the first post.








, The wire needs to extend from the ground terminal of the charger to all the grounding posts. Secure the wire to the posts with a grounding clamp.








, Use a long string to mark a straight line for your posts and use a post-hole digger to set them securely in the ground. As a general rule of thumb, at least 1/3rd of the overall length of your post should be under the ground. Corner posts should be larger in diameter than the posts along the sides, and should also be installed with at least 1/3rd of their length under the ground, and/or should be properly braced.










Don't use too many posts. A common mistake is to install posts too frequently, thinking this will result in a stronger and more secure fence. However, if you do plan to install your posts 40 feet (12.2 m) or more apart, you should install stays along the wires to keep them evenly spaced and create greater stability.

, To install electric fencing properly, the posts exposed to the most stress need to be reinforced with braces, cement footings or anchors. Many cattle ranchers will use what's called a ""floating diagonal” brace, which means the angle brace is a 4-in. by 10-ft. post notched a half-inch into the main corner post, with the other end set on the ground opposite the corner.







, Because you need to keep the electricity in the wires and away from the posts, insulators are important to install. It'll depend on the type of fence wire you purchase, because manufacturers will usually include and design insulators tailored to their products.









Most common are are insulators that allow braided or rope style fencing enough space to slide through, helping to avoid rubbing.

, Use connector clamps included with your variety of fencing wire to mount the wire on the posts. Begin at the post that's the farthest away from the charger, hang as many lines of wire you need to charge the line.









Never just wrap the wire around the fence posts, because the cable will come loose more easily and corrosion can occur. Use the connector clamps provided by the manufacturer.
The wires will need to be pulled taut at the anchor end. There are a variety of methods for doing this: you could install a self-locking ratchet-style wire tensioner, use a come-along cable puller, or install a turnbuckle cable tensioner.
Tighten the wire as much as possible, but take care not to place so much tension on it that it breaks, as this can result in serious injury.

, Use a voltmeter to test the lines to ensure the electricity flows through the entire fence. Write down the voltage and keep the number on hand to compare to daily checks of the current. Depending on the strength of your charger, it should read somewhere between 6000 and 10,000 volts, unconnected.








, Connect the lines together with a 10 to 14-gauge jumper wire and attach a jumper wire from the top line of the electric fence to the charger. Recheck all the lines before you turn the charger on.








, After everything is attached, recheck the voltage at a point farthest away from the charger. You should notice a slight drop in voltage, but no more than 2000 volts, which might mean you've got a short-circuit or some kind of interference in the fence.








, It's good to check regularly to prevent signal problems and to make corrections as necessary. Moisture and vegetation build-up can cause temporary leeching of the current, leading you to get lower-voltage readings. If your current is lower than usual, it might be time to do a closer inspection of your work and fix it up.








, Grasses, bushes, and weeds growing up along your fence can lead to a loss of voltage. Remove any plants that have grown up along your fence, and spray a glyphosate herbicide (like RoundUp) to reduce plant growth in the area."

,
Use a pry bar to raise the lattice frame so it will be tight against the porch or deck.,
Open and shut the lattice frames to make sure they shut properly.",How to Install Lattice," Be careful not to damage the porch, deck, or support columns when removing existing lattice.


Cut the lattice into pieces with a reciprocating saw if you are having trouble removing it. This will make it easier.You can also use a small carpenters cat's paw, which will help pry off small nails. If the old lattice is stapled, find a screwdriver with a blade just wide enough to fit onto the staple. Gently pry it off.;
, Do not install new lattice without making sure there are no animals living underneath your deck.


If you find animals, encourage them to leave by allowing as much light in as possible. Also, let your water hose run next to the deck. This will encourage the animals to leave because they like dark, dry, and quiet areas to nest in.Avoid using traps or poison as that may kill any non-target animals or kill an animal in an unreachable place.
You may be able to find a volunteer group that will relocate wildlife. Call your local or state fish and game office or city animal control to learn about options in your area. If you can't find a volunteer, you may be able to hire a professional wildlife removal service.

, You will screw the lattice to the frames, and then you will attach the frames to the house. Be sure to use rust-proof hardware and fasteners.

, Measure the openings between the support columns or posts of the deck or porch. The completed frames should be 1/2 inch narrower than the overall width and 1 inch shorter than the height of the openings.If you install the lattice flush to the ground, the framing can buckle and snag leaves., Use a circular or jigsaw to cut 1-by-6 inch lumber to a length of 4 1/2-feet or to your required measured length.

, Cut the center stiles the same length as the shorter edges of the frames using 1-by-4 inch lumber.

, Lay the frame pieces face down and assemble them. Attach a 6-inch mending plate and a 3 1/2-inch flat corner brace to each corner joint of the frame. Attach the hardware approximately 1/4 inch from the edges of the frames using 3/4-inch flathead screws. Make sure you work on a flat, sturdy surface to put together the frames

, Use two 4-inch T-plates, making sure that the plate is centered on the support piece. Position the T-plates about ¼ inch from the edge of the frame. Use 3/4-inch screws to secure them. , Lay the frames face down. Attach a piece of lattice to each frame using 1-inch pan head screws driven through washers.Allow a 1/ 4-inch gap on all sides between the edge of the frame and lattice. This lets the lattice to expand and contract when the weather changes. This will prevent the lattice from buckling., The two pieces of lattice will form a seam on the center stile. Screw 1-inch (2.54 cm) pan head screws with washers to each of the lattice panels where they meet at the center stile. Make two rows of screws, drilling them at each point the lattices meet.

, Screw the hinges to the lattice frames first.

,, Once it is tight, screw the hinges to the porch or deck using a drill with a screwdriver head.

, If the lattice frame drags on the ground or doesn't close all the way, use a shovel or garden hoe to remove some of the dirt in front of and underneath the frame. If there is too much space beneath the lattice frame, add and compact more dirt. Distribute the dirt evenly so that the ground will be flat.

It's also wise to discuss the project with your neighbors. If the fence is on an adjoining property line, you may be able to split the costs 50/50.;
, Depending on the size and shape of the area in which you're installing fencing, you'll need to figure out how much fencing you'll need to enclose the given space.

If you just want a decorative fence, measure the length of the side of your yard you want to fence. If you want an enclosed fence, measure the total area and the length of each side.
If you want a prefabricated fence, measure a single panel before buying. Mark off this distance along your planned fence line and stake the position of each fence panel. You'll end up setting fence posts at each stake, aligning them with the twine line and mounding soil around them above ground level.

, Call the local utilities companies to determine the locations of your lines if you aren't sure. Do not dig anything until the utility company representatives have identified and marked all the buried lines. You can also call 811 in some areas to get information about power lines.

, Take your measurements to the hardware store and purchase fencing that suits your tastes and your needs. Larger wooden fences might need to be cut from scratch, while prefabricated fences are available in a wide variety of styles and methods of installation.


If you're buying a pre-fabricated fence, take your measurements to the store and shop around for possibilities.

, If you want to cut your own fence posts, you'll need wood that will hold up underground. This can be wood rated for direct ground contact, pressure-treated wood which has been injected with preservative, or wood coated with wood preservative at home (as described below).

Gate posts and corner posts are usually larger than the rest.

, Before installing the fence, you'll need to complete any staining and painting that you'd like on the wood. It'll be easier to do this before you put it together. This should definitely be done on fence posts that you're cutting yourself, and also possibly on pre-fab models that are untreated. Brush the posts and fencing panels with oil-based wood stain. Wipe off excess stain and allow everything to dry completely.

, If the wood is not pressure-treated, paint the fence posts with copper naphthenate or another wood preservative to one-third of their height and allow them to dry thoroughly, following the manufacturer's instructions. This hinders rot from the contact with the damp soil and the underground sections of the posts. Treat all cut ends with preservative as well.

Alternatively, you can paint on just the below-ground portions in advance, to reduce mess during installation. Treat the rest with an airless sprayer once the fence is complete.
Follow all safety instructions on the preservative label. Copper naphthenate can irritate skin, eyes, and lungs., Whatever kind of fence you're installing, it's a good idea to mark each corner of the fenced-in area with stakes. At each corner, plant a small wooden stake to mark the spot clearly.

, To get started, you'll need to start installing the fence posts, which will form the corners of the fence. Dig a hole that is twice the diameter of the post and one-third of the height of the post, using a posthole digger. Make the bottom of the hole slightly larger than the top to make sure you'll be able to seat it properly and securely.


It's a good idea to place the dirt you remove on a tarp, so you'll be able to keep it in an even pile for putting it back in and securing the post. Remove any large rocks and roots from the hole. If necessary, cut large roots free.
If you’re going to be digging a lot of holes or setting a lot of posts, consider renting a gas-powered hole digger. This machine requires a strong helper and close attention to safety precautions to avoid injury.

, Add 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of gravel to the hole, spreading it evenly across the bottom. This allows proper drainage away from the fence posts during inclement weather, extending the life of the fence itself.


Pea-sized landscaping gravel, often just called ""pea gravel"" is usually the most affordable and effective type of gravel for the job.

, Set a corner or end post into the hole, and add 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) of soil. Check the level of the fence post by placing a carpenter's level on at least 2 sides. When the fence post is level, tamp the soil to compact it solidly into the hole. Add another 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) of soil, check the level and tamp the soil. Repeat until you have filled the hole completely.


Instead of filling the holes back up with soil, you can mix up a small batch of concrete and use that to fill in above the gravel. For an even easier time, there’s a variety of concrete specifically for fence posts, which can be added dry to the hole and soaked with a hose to allow it to set up quickly and easily. Brace the post plumb before filling by using 1"" x 4"" boards (4' to 6' long), staking, and screws or duplex nails.

, Mound dirt around the fence post at ground level, rounding it with a trowel, if you filled in around the post with soil. This will direct rain and snow melt away from the fence post, as well as help to secure the post in the ground.


If you do use concrete, you still want to have a gentle slope away from the post. Fill it halfway with concrete and ensure that the post is still level when you install. Let the concrete cure properly, then fill the rest of the hole with dirt.

, In most pre-fab kits, twine is used to connect the fence posts to the stakes and make sure that everything will be installed at an even height to match the fencing panels. If you're installing your own fencing, you can use the same technique.


Tie twine to a corner or end post, about 6 inches (15 cm) from the ground.
Stretch the twine taut to the position of the next corner or end post. Affix it to a stake at the same height to use as a reference.

, Set the corner and end posts first, using your twine as a height reference. Continue on, repeating the steps above until you've installed all the fence posts.

Before seating each one, double-check the precise distance between posts with a tape measure.

, Depending on what kind of fence you're installing, you might need to either install a cross-beam to provide yourself something to attach individual fence panels onto, or you might just set up the large piece of fence paneling and slot it into the fence posts. Each fence will be different, so you'll need to proceed according to your own plans for the fence if you're making your own, or following the directions of the fence kit you purchased.


If you're cutting your own panels or fence slats, install cross-beams with wood-screws between each set of fence posts. You can either use a crossing ""X"" pattern, or flat beams parallel to the ground, depending on what you're going for. Cut fence panels of the appropriate height for your fence.
If you're installing a pre-fab fence, most panels will be quite large, but you'll need to install a post between every panel, meaning that you might need to install more posts as you work. You can either install a post, attach the panel and support it while you dig the next post, or go around and install all the posts before you start inserting the panels. Brace recently installed posts during this process to ensure adequate panel support while the post fill cures or sets.

, While you work, it's usually a good idea to use two-three inch galvanized wood screws to attach your panels securely. Drill pilot holes to keep the wood clean and sharp-looking, then install enough wood screws to attach the panels securely.

, Whatever kind of fence you're installing, it's a good idea to support the crossbeams with some supporting blocks to avoid putting stress on the wood as you work. You can use wooden wedges to level the panel.

, The hardest part of installing the fence is getting the posts dug and seated securely. After that, it's just a matter of filling in the rest with panels or planks. Take your time to measure each new piece of paneling for plumb with your carpenter's level and install each securely according to the directions.

Remove any bushes, plants, trees or stationary objects that are in the way of your planned fence.Call the local utility diggers hotline to have all underground lines marked before you do any digging. In the United States or Canada, dial 811 or check with your local utility company. Many regions have their own digger's hotline numbers.;
, Depending on the size and shape of your yard, or the area you want to fence off, you may want to go right along the property line, or measure other configurations and shapes. Whatever the case, you need to find out how much fencing you'll need to buy by measuring the desired area. Take these measurements to the home improvement store to buy supplies.


You can place stakes at the corners of your fence's perimeter and use them to rope the area off before the project begins, or you can spray paint the fence's perimeter.

, You can purchase vinyl fencing in lengths that range from 2 to 8 feet (0.6 to 2.4 m). These lengths you place between vinyl fence posts. If you are fencing a very large area, purchase larger sections so you can bury fewer fence posts.


Your material should be about one inch (2.5 cm) thick, four inches (10 cm) wide, and four to six feet (1.2 - 1.8 m) long. You will also need two 12 in (30 cm) wooden stakes and four screws for temporary bracing.
Make sure you also get enough concrete for each post.
If you need an entry point along the fence, it's also important to purchase a vinyl gate kit that fits with the fencing you choose., After purchasing enough posts, fence lengths, and the gate kits necessary to make your fence, mark the post positions and the lengths between the desired posts to ensure your vinyl fence section and hardware will fit. You can't trim vinyl fencing sections, so you must be certain about your measurements.

, Between each place where you plan to dig a hole, it's a good idea to set everything up to make the installation process easier. Make sure your posts are in the right location before digging your holes.

, Use either a power auger or a hand post-hole digger to dig holes that are 10 inches (25.4 cm) in diameter. Post holes should be deep enough to hold 1/3 the length of your post, plus 6 more inches for a gravel base.


If you don't have an auger or digger, you can rent a power auger at a home improvement store, or you can dig them with a shovel, though it'll take a lot longer.

, Once you've dug the holes for the posts, the next step is to install each post securely before connecting them with the vinyl sections. Always defer to the manufacturer's instructions for installation, but generally its recommended to install posts secured with gravel and concrete.


Insert a 2 foot (61 cm) long 4"" x 4"" or 5"" x 5"" and use 1.5 in (3.8-4 cm) screws on at least two sides to secure the post to wood. Place the post into hole on gravel base and then pour concrete into hole and evenly around entire post. Stop six inches (15 cm) below ground level to add soil for grass when concrete is cured.
Check to make sure the pole is plumb using a level, and move on to the next post hole. Continue installing all the posts and return to the beginning and make sure it's seated level again., Use a trough to scrape any excess concrete away from the posts so that the concrete slopes down away from the pole. This prevents water from pooling around the pole. Let the concrete dry completely.

, Generally, vinyl fence sections snap right into place. Follow the specific manufacturer's directions regarding vinyl fence sections, as some may slide halfway into the post. Attach the rails to the ends of each section with screws, if necessary, and then secure the rails to the posts in the ground.


Pre-drilling a pilot hole before installing your rail screws can be helpful and may be necessary.

, Again, defer to the manufacturer's instructions. Generally, most vinyl fence kits will come with decorative toppers for the posts that you can snap on.

, If you have been looking for a while and you are finding it increasingly difficult to find an apartment in your price range, expand your search criteria. You may look at locations a little bit further than you originally planned or building without certain amenities. Prioritize what you are able to be flexible with and change your search criteria.Many times it is the location that is the most difficult thing to find as the most prime apartments are often taken or priced for their coveted location. While your commute may factor into your location, also factor in safety and cleanliness. Adding a few minutes to your commute is an easy sacrifice for a safe and clean apartment.

, If you’re moving with other people, make sure that everyone has a chance to see the place before signing anything. Get everyone’s feedback and opinion and make sure you all get a chance to discuss your likes and dislikes.Don’t rely on pictures. Make sure that each roommate gets to physically see the apartment so that they can form a solid opinion.

, There may be special move-in offers or certain special discounts depending on the apartment. Some landlords offer the first month free if you sign a longer lease. You may also get bonuses if you have referred a friend.It never hurts to ask what’s available to you. There may also be discounts for students, retirees, veterans, or individuals with special needs. Refer to any professional affiliations as well.

, Ask the landlord about the average utility cost before signing anything. The rent may be exactly at your budget but any additional cost may hurt you as the lease goes on. Make sure you get a sense of the hidden costs utilities may provide.

, Once you have narrowed down your top three choices, negotiate with the landlords and let them know that you have other options. If a landlord knows that you are interested but have other options, she may be willing to come down in price or work to find other bonuses like extra storage or parking., If you don’t get the apartment that you want there may be something similar in the same building or another building owned by the same landlord. Consider moving into a studio instead of a one-bedroom or getting a roommate for a two bedroom. Buildings will have apartments with similar floor plans with an extra bedroom., Amenities like free Wi-Fi or gym may save you money on outside costs. However, don’t let amenities be the driving force of your decision. Carefully consider what you are willing to pay in rent for your amenities.Views are also great to have but not a necessity. Inquire if there are similar apartments within the building but without the same view. This can help save you money.

, The physical building may impress you but get a sense of your neighbours and what the living conditions may be like. Tenants can tell you if it’s noisy on the weekend or if there are newborns on your floor. You also want to find out about your landlord. You want to make sure he is safe, courteous and maintains the apartment promptly.Inquire about infrastructure issues, response time to tenant issues, tenant turnover, and safety issues. It is also wise to ask about the area and the typical cost of living. Find out about what tenants pay for utilities, entertainment, and transportation.
Ask about the school district if you’re moving with a family, restaurants, grocery stores, and closest amenities.

, Think of your application as a rental resume and make sure you put your best foot forward. The documents that you should include are:A copy of your rental application. You should have filled this out online. If they asked you to fill it out in person, make sure that you provide neat handwriting.
A copy of your credit report.
A letter of reference from your current or last landlord. If this is your first apartment you can provide a character reference from an employer or teacher if you are a student.
A copy of your current or most recent apartment lease.
Employment verification. This should include a copy of your most recent tax return or W-2 as well as your three most current pay stubs.
A summary of yourself. Don’t go into detail but give a positive glimpse of the type of tenant you will be. Talk about your hobbies and lifestyle to paint you as an ideal tenant.
Any details about any pets if you currently have one.

, If your documents aren’t enough to persuade your landlord, offer to pay rent a week or even a month in advance until the month before the expiration of your lease. Show her that you are easy to manage and reliable.You may also be given a deal if you offer to pay in advance or offer an extra incentive to make your landlord’s life easier.

, Once you are satisfied with the location, landlord, and apartment, conduct a final walk-through before signing anything. Be sure that you won’t be held responsible for any damages caused by the previous tennant and make sure to check the following with your landlord:Check that all the lights, faucets, and toilets work properly.
Look for any presence of rodents or insects specifically droppings, chew marks, or eggs/larvae in the storage spaces.
Make sure all outlets work. Bring your phone charger and plug it into each outlet.
Check smoke alarms and fire equipment. A smoke extinguisher may be placed in the kitchen.
Open and close all the windows and doors. Make sure the locks work and there is no damage.
Make sure all appliances work. Turn them off and on. Ask to be walked through the functionality to ensure that they work.
Examine the walls, floors, and ceiling for damage. Inspect tiles, linoleum, drywall, and carpet.
Take pictures of any issues and make sure your landlord takes note. You may be able to negotiate changing something or a drop in rent. Be sure to save the pictures in case there are discrepancies with maintenance or issues getting your security deposit back.

, Take the time to fully comprehend your lease. If you need to take it home or ask questions, don’t hesitate. This is a big commitment so don’t feel rushed or pressured. Leases vary depending on length of time and contract terms. Sign only when you feel comfortable.Periodic leases work well for a short duration because the landlord acknowledges that your situation may change every month. This allows you to renew with each new month. While it gives you more flexibility, they may be more costly.Most common is a fixed-term lease. These usually range from three, six, or twelve months. While you can lock in a lower rate, you may be responsible for the rest of your lease if you must break it before the expiration date. Discuss contingencies with your landlord as you may be able to just pay a penalty if you have to break your lease.Subleases are three-party lease agreements that happen when you have to break your lease but are able to find someone to takeover paying the remainder of your lease agreement. The new tenant takes over the remaining lease term with the approval of the landlord."

Get the right tools.,
Evaluate which pieces of furniture must be disassembled in order to fit through constricted spaces.,
Inspect furniture pieces for disassembling points.,
Disassemble furniture with tools.,
Keep hardware attached to the furniture pieces.",How to Disassemble Furniture When Preparing for a Move," Disassembling furniture often requires some standard tools. One is a flat head or Philips head screwdriver of an appropriate size for small furniture screws. In addition, much new furniture requires a small hex wrench, where having a set of these tiny metal wrenches will help.;
,


Some industry resources show that the top three most disassembled pieces of furniture are desks, entertainment centers and sofas. Look at these big furniture installations, and others like beds, armories and dressers, to find out which ones will need some structural work in order to be removed from the home.
Measure all furniture for clearance. Methodically measuring all large pieces of furniture and appliances will ensure that all of these items can make their way unimpeded out to the moving truck.
Assess your environment. Some places are harder to move furniture out of than others. For example, a New York City loft might present a bigger challenge than a medium-sized detached house in the suburbs. Look at all of the obstacles that furniture pieces may face to brainstorm how to get them through a home.

, In many cases, it's easy to see where sofa legs, bookcase shelves and similar pieces get unscrewed or detached. For some pieces, for example, where upholstery covers dis assembly points, finding these critical points can be more challenging.

, Use two or more people as necessary to prevent parts of certain furniture pieces from falling on the floor and getting damaged.

, Lots of little screws and other fasteners can get lost in the moving process. To prevent this, seal all small parts in a plastic bag or other container, or simply keep them to the outside or inside of a piece of furniture.

Get to know your neighbors.,
Find a religious community.,
Join a social group or club.,
Use local message boards.,
Make friends at work or school.,
Ask for help.",How to Deal With Moving Related Loneliness1," When you arrive in your new home, make an effort to get to know your neighbors. You might feel strange, or awkward, but even if you don’t become lifelong friends, you will benefit from being on friendly terms. A simple smile and wave will be enough for most people. Stop by your immediate neighbors’ homes to say a quick hello and introduce yourself or your family. You can ask questions about the neighborhood (such as trash pick-up days), and can answer a few questions about yourself and your family.
If you feel comfortable, you can host a little party for your neighbors to get to know them, offering them a chance to meet you and get to know a little bit about you in a casual, relaxed setting.;
, If you are religious, getting involved in your local church is an excellent way to meet likeminded people. Choose a church or meeting to attend, or choose several and visit a new one each week. See where you fit in and feel comfortable.While some religions have strict rules about which church you can attend, most do not. Look around, visit different churches, and meet with different clergymen to find the right fit for you.

, Groups run the gamut, from Young Republicans to book clubs. Evaluate your interests and search for a local group of people who enjoy similar hobbies or interests.


Social groups often have chapters worldwide. If you are already a member of any type of group, meet with the group’s leader to see if there is a branch in your new community, or a similar organization you can join.
Some apps are intended for this exact purpose. Meetup, iGon, Weave, and Majikal are just a few that offer groups, events, and local business opportunities. A word of caution, however: any time you meet strangers, be wary of divulging contact information, and always meet in a public place.

, Many towns have message boards and Facebook groups designed to keep people in touch with one another. Search to see if your town has a message board or Facebook group, and join in the conversation.Some towns have Facebook groups specifically for selling or buying items, much like Craigslist. Although this might not seem like the ideal way to make friends, selling or searching for certain items could connect you to people in similar lifestyle situations, such as people with young children, or people who love to garden.
Visit your city’s website for information about message boards. Many cities will have these groups posted directly to the city’s website.

, If you are working or going to school, you have a built-in network of people. While not every person you work or go to school with will be an instant connection, make yourself known and familiar around the office or school.If your colleagues are grabbing dinner after work, or having a drink, tag along. This will allow you to socialize without the pressure of getting work done, and will provide a low-key means of getting to know your coworkers.
Make use of after-school programs or extracurricular groups to meet more people in a setting they are familiar or comfortable with.

, If you need help, ask for it. If you need help moving, find a moving service. If cleaning out your new home is drastically outside of your comfort zone, find a cleaning service and utilize their skills. You can meet some wonderful people by simply inviting them to perform a service for you.


While this may not be a great way to make friends, it is a great way to get an idea of what types of people and activities you have in your new town. You can ask the people you’ve hired what they like to do for fun, where they like to eat, etc.
Always treat people helping you with kindness. If they are providing a service, offer a tip. If they are helping for free (such as a neighbor helping you move in), give baked goods or a gift card in exchange.

Depending on the amount of things in your room, buy at least 10 boxes ranging from large to small. Also get a roll of bubble wrap, masking tape, a black marker, and a trash bag or two.Also consider getting one or two wardrobe boxes for packing your nicer clothes. If you are transporting posters, buy cylindrical poster containers to protect them from damage. Keep tools like screwdrivers and cleaning supplies handy as well.
Make sure you are wearing comfortable clothes that you can move around in, as well as sneakers or other flat bottomed, closed-toed shoes.
Even though it may seem more efficient, don’t buy only large boxes. Large boxes can get extremely heavy when packed, which will make carrying them a pain.;
, You don’t want pack things that you’ll eventually just throw out when unpacking. Before you start packing, look around your room for any trash, papers or debris that you don’t need. Then, go through your possessions, especially your clothes, and see if there are any items that you no longer use.You can throw these items out or donate them if they are things like clothing or useable electronics.

, Before packing everything away, separate out the items you may need during the move. This may include a few outfits and toiletries like deodorant that you may keep in your bedroom. Also pack any electronics that you’ll need during the days of your move.Pack all your essentials in a backpack or small suitcase that is easy to carry around.

, It’s a good idea to get fragile items wrapped up and packed away before you tackle the rest of your room. Take any fragile items like lamps or glass ornaments and wrap them liberally in bubble-wrap. Tape the bubble-wrap so that the item stays secure inside. Pack a small box, or several small boxes, with fragile items.Make sure that each box of fragile items is full so that the items don’t slide around. If there’s a lot of space left in the box, stuff it with tissue paper or bubble-wrap.
After you are done packing the fragile items, tape up the box and mark it “Fragile”. Place it outside your bedroom on a counter or tabletop and make sure not to put any other boxes on top of it.

, Fill small boxes with small, non-fragile items like papers, books, knick-knacks and whatever you may have on the top of your bedside table or on your bookshelf. If you are worried that the items might rattle around or get damaged during the move, wrap them in clothes to cushion them.Pack books spine-down in the box.
Label each box you pack with labels like “Bedroom Books”. Use a dark marker and write on at least two sides of the box.

, You will need to roll up items like rugs and posters to transport them. If you have a rug in your room, roll it and tie it using a length of rope. Take posters down from the wall and remove any tacks or tape. Roll them up, slide a rubber band to secure the roll, and then put them into a cylindrical poster tube.


The poster tube protects the poster so that it doesn’t tear or get crushed in the moving process.

, You’ll have enough to worry about when you move into your new house or apartment without worrying about finding clean clothes. As you are washing your dirty clothes, you can begin to separate and organize your clean ones.

, Packing your clothes is often the most time-consuming aspect of packing up a bedroom. Instead of throwing everything into boxes, first organize your clothes by season. Put all your spring and summer clothes in one pile, and your winter and fall clothes in another. Make separate piles for underwear and socks, as well as for shoes., If you own any clothing items like a tuxedo or a very delicate dress, keep these items on their hangers. Instead of packing them in boxes, hang them in a wardrobe box. If possible, place the wardrobe box outside your room to minimize clutter.Wardrobe boxes are tall boxes that have a hanging rail inside that helps you to hang your clothes. Wardrobe boxes take up a lot of space, so if space is an issue you should only use them for your more fancy clothes.
If you have curtains in your room, fold them lengthwise and hang them from a padded hanger. Then place the hanger in the wardrobe box to prevent the curtains from creasing.You can also use wardrobe bags if you are worried about space. Wardrobe bags protect your clothes but they don't stand upright. The should be packed on top of your boxes so that your clothes don't get crushed or damaged.

, Not only will folding your clothes make them less wrinkled when you take them out of the box, it will also help you pack more economically since folded clothes take up less space. After folding, place each type of clothing in its own box.Label the boxes according to what is inside, with labels like “Summer shirts”, “Shoes” or “Skirts and shorts”. Seal the boxes with packing tape., Fold up your sheets and blankets and put them in a large box along with your pillows. If you wish, put your mattress in a mattress bag to prevent it from getting dirty. Take the mattress out of the room and lean in against a wall to give yourself more space., You may have furniture items in your room like bookshelves or lamps that need to be disassembled before they can be moved. Use a screwdriver to remove nails or screws that keep the item together. If you are unsure of how to disassemble a certain piece of furniture, try to find the manual the item came with, or look online for the manual of the specific model you have.If you are using a moving service, they can help you to disassemble the bed frame and take the mattress and frame out of your room.
To disassemble your bed frame on your own, start by removing the bed slats, and then unscrew the screws in the frame to break the bed frame into several pieces.
Place any nuts, bolts or other small parts of the bed frame in a plastic bag.

, Clearing out the furniture will allow you to clean your room thoroughly. If you are renting a moving truck, have the movers help you move the furniture. Otherwise you may have to enlist the help of friends to help you move the furniture out of the bedroom.


Make sure not to scratch furniture if you’re moving it, especially furniture made of wood which is particularly scratchable.If you are worried about furniture getting scratched, tape bubble-wrap onto the edges of each item.

, There probably will still be a few odds and ends lying around your room. Pack them up in a box, making sure to wrap any items in bubble-wrap if necessary. Label this box “Miscellaneous”, or a label that describes what most of the objects are, such as “Art Supplies.” By this point, your room should be completely bare and ready to clean!

, After you have moved out all your belongings, you may notice that your walls are scuffed or dirty. First, remove all tacks, tape, or nails that you may have on your walls. Then use a non-abrasive all-purpose cleaner to scrub the walls.Dip the sponge into water mixed with a tablespoon of solution and wring out the sponge.
Test a patch of the wall by scrubbing with the sponge. If the sponge doesn’t leave a watermark or a dark mark when it dries, use the sponge to clean any dirty spots or scuffs on your wall.
If you have small holes in your wall, fill them with putty. Then use a putty knife or even your finger to smooth the putty and make it level with the wall.

, Use a high-powered vacuum to give your floor a through vacuum. Make sure to get every nook and cranny of the room. If the room is carpeted, go over the whole room a couple of times. Carpeting captures a lot of dust and dirt, so going over it just once may not do the trick., If you have carpeting in your room and notice that there is a stain, use a carpet stain remover to get rid of the stain. Follow the instructions on the bottle to effectively remove the stain. If the carpet is white, make sure not to use a colored product that could stain the rug further., Now that the room is empty, you may see dust clinging to surfaces formerly covered by furniture or posters. Use a feather duster to brush away light dust. You can also use a damp paper towel to get at thick dust or dust bunnies. Also make sure to dust window ledges and around the threshold of the door., Spray a newspaper with window cleaner and rub over the entire surface the windows in your room. If your room came with an in-wall mirror, use the same method to clean the mirror and leave it sparkling.

Take advantage of local excursions.,
Use local amenities, like the library or YMCA.",How to Deal With Moving Related Loneliness2," Volunteer to walk dogs at the local pet shelter, offer to help with toy donations at your local elementary school, or even offer your time to your local boy scouts troupe. In volunteering your time, you are giving back to your community, while meeting new people and making acquaintances.When volunteering in a new place, start one volunteering position at a time. Even if you are a volunteer veteran, different cities and organizations place different expectations upon their workers.
Volunteer according to your interests. This will help you find people who enjoy similar things, which will increase the likelihood of making lasting connections.
If you volunteered with other organizations back home, the organization might have a chapter in your new town. Your previous chapter can send an email or make a call to make introductions. Habitat for Humanity and the Special Olympics are two nonprofits that have branches or offices in numerous towns.

, To truly integrate yourself into your new community, you need to know what is going on in your city. Visit your city offices to find out what new laws or ordinances are being proposed, what types of services your city has to offer, and to discover whether or not your city has pressing needs you can assist with.Although many boards will require an election process, city offices often have volunteer opportunities, and are happy to help people get involved.
When visiting your city office, offer your help. You can lead a park clean-up every Saturday morning, or offer a free yoga class during office lunch. The office may not have any available volunteer positions, but either way, you are making yourself known in your new home.

, Although you may be tempted to indulge in your tried-and-true franchised places for food and necessities, step outside of the box and try new eateries and use local brick-and-mortar shops for your daily necessities. You will likely pay a higher price, but you will meet more locals this way, and can talk to the owners and workers about your new town.Coffee shops are often great places to visit as you work to build community. Striking up a conversation with a stranger over coffee can provide a lot of insight into your home.
If you find a place you love, show it! Visit regularly, and let your face become familiar to the workers. You can build connections with the workers, or you might find yourself getting along with other regulars.

, Many cities organize nature hikes, community concerts, and even block parties. Take advantage of these offerings, as time permits, and immerse yourself in your new home.


If your city does not have any events like this organized, offer to help! If you have experience organizing parties or planning community events, offer your services. You might not get paid, but you can certainly get your name out in your new community, and you will come into contact with a lot of new faces.

, Your city likely has basic services such as a library, a park, a community center, etc. Take advantage of these offerings! Check books out from the library, go for a stroll in the park, and enroll in a community class. These are all excellent ways to meet new people and make friends, and they all cost little to nothing--a great option for someone who has just incurred the expense of moving.Most libraries have classes and groups that meet throughout the week. Join a book club, or meet with a “Mommy and Me” group to give yourself some more structure to your week, and meet people in your area.
Community centers typically have classes that might be offered at gyms and community colleges, but at a fraction of the price. Take advantage of these savings, and learn something new.

Get settled in.,
Fill your time wisely.,
Cultivate a new skill.,
Say “yes” to invitations.,
Take time for yourself.,
Speak with a therapist.,
Keep in touch.",How to Deal With Moving Related Loneliness3," Moving to a new place and having no friends or family might mean you have a lot of free time on your hands. Use this time to settle into your new home. Unpack, decorate, and purge, making your home a place you truly love and feel comfortable in.Your home should be your place to retreat to. This is especially true if you have no sense of community or support where you live. Take time to fill your home with the things you love and give yourself permission to remove anything you don’t.
Part of getting settled in is getting everything changed over to your new address. Get your driver license changed, get your new library card, fill out change of address forms with the postal service, and register any vehicles with the DMV.

, Moving without community can mean having a lot of free time. This can be a wonderful advantage or a great difficulty. If you find yourself with a lot of extra time on your hands, try to avoid filling your time with TV and eating comfort foods, taking that time to instead get out and try something new, to study for school, or to get a leg up on any housework that needs to be done.Although there is nothing wrong with watching TV, doing nothing else may result in lower self-esteem or a rapid loss of free time. If you must watch TV, try to do something productive during the inactive time, such as cleaning, cooking, or using a new skill such as knitting.

, If you are finding it difficult to make new friends, despite having tried to get involved in your community, take time to cultivate a new skill. You can work on your skill at home, or a take a class--either way, opening yourself up to new experiences makes it far more likely that you’ll find people who share your interests.Learning a new skill can be expensive, or entirely free, depending on where you go. You can join a local class, or you can use online tutorials for free (or at a reduced cost). Choose the option that best fits your financial needs and time constraints.

, If a neighbor invites you to a party, try to find the time to go. If you receive a mailed invitation to visit an open house for a new business, stop by and give it a glance. This can even be said of things you might not normally attend, like a holiday pageant at a local church, or a play at the community center. Each of these has the potential to connect you with people who can eventually become friends.Try to step out of your comfort zone and start a conversation with the people around you. At a play, you might talk to the people in the seats on either side of you, or at a business opening, you might take a few minutes to talk to the new business owner. Take the opportunity to say a quick hello whenever possible.

, Pamper yourself during this time. Soak your feet at the end of a long work day, get a massage, or take some time to meditate. While it might seem like a trial to be lonely, it can give you the benefit of some time to reflect and slow down. Set aside some time to evaluate your priorities. What is it that you’re seeking in a community? What types of qualities are you looking for in a friend? A partner? Determine exactly how you’d like your life to look, and start working toward that goal.

, Don’t be afraid to seek the help of a mental health professional. Loneliness can lead to depression and other mental health concerns, so learn to recognize the difference between being sad that you don’t have a support system in the immediate area, and feeling hopeless and unable to break free from your sadness.Although a therapist or counselor is not going to be able to cure your loneliness, they might have some tools to minimize the effects of loneliness. They might also help you with peripheral concerns, such as low self esteem, that might make it difficult to reach out to others and build up a network of friends.

, Although you don’t want to rely entirely upon your family and friends from your old home, you still need the support of your loved ones. Take a few minutes each week to check in with a quick call or text.


Skype and Facetime are excellent ways to stay in touch with friends and family. Set up a monthly date with your loved ones. Although you might not be able to see and speak to them in person, video chats are the next best thing.

, Using the magic eraser, go through each room and remove any scuff marks on the walls, floors, or doors. (Warning: Test the magic eraser first, as it can clean some paints right off the wall.)

, Fill the sink with warm water and add dish detergent to the water.


The refrigerator - Remove all of the shelves and drawers from the refrigerator and freezer and place them in the dishwasher or wash them by hand. Dip a sponge into the dishwater and wipe down the interior of the refrigerator and freezer, being certain to remove any food build-up. Don't forget the little compartments where you kept the butter and eggs! Then wipe down all of the shelves, dry the shelves, and place them back in the refrigerator.
The oven- One way would be to use one to two cans (depending on whether you EVER cleaned the oven while you lived in the apartment) of oven cleaner to get the oven really clean. Read the safety directions carefully, many oven cleaners require protective equipment (gloves & goggles) and strong ventilation. Do not ignore the directions on the can. Place newspaper in front of the oven, slightly underneath the door or drawer and extended out to protect your floor from dripping cleaner. Evenly apply both cans to the inside of the oven, the grates, the broiler sheets, etc. Throw the drip pans from the stove in there and coat them too. Let sit for 24 hours. Do not turn on oven! Using a sponge and paper towels, wipe down all surfaces. Rinse with clean water. Clean the vent above the stove and be certain that the light bulb in the overhead hood is in working condition. Alternatively, if you want to avoid the chemicals in oven cleaners, you can use a dilution of 100g baking soda in 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of water and spray onto the surfaces and leave for at least 1 hour. For a dirtier oven, increase the amount of baking soda so that the solution is more of a paste than a liquid. After one hour use an ice scraper to remove the burnt carbon, and spray any remaining in the oven. Repeat the process until the oven is completely clean.
The cabinets - Using a multi-purpose cleaner that is safe to use on your cabinets, wipe down the interior and the exterior of the cabinets.
The light fixtures - You should then check to make sure the light fixtures are clean and do not have any dead insects in them. If there are glass fixture covers, give them a wipe. Think twice before throwing them into the dishwasher, because thermal stresses and harsh detergents may damage the glass.
The surfaces - Make sure you wipe down the exterior of the refrigerator, the stove range (including underneath the drip bowls), and all of the counter tops. Also, wipe down the exterior and interior of the dishwasher, microwave, and any other appliance provided by your apartment complex (including the surface of any washer or dryer).
The sink - Drain the water from the sink and clean the sink and wipe down the faucet. If the sink is stainless steel or porcelain, a powdered cleanser works great! An old toothbrush or other small brush can be very useful for scrubbing around the edges of fixtures and the sink.
The floor - Sweep and then mop the floor. To do a really good job, you should pull out the stove and refrigerator and clean that part of the floor too. Be extra careful when pulling these appliances as they can scratch wooden floors, damage linoleum or break tile. You will also find all kinds of gross stuff on the sides of the appliances and cabinets when you do that. Oh, and those little things that you have been looking for that you lost eight months ago that rolled underneath the stove or refrigerator.

,


Thoroughly clean the sink, tub, toilet and shower. Make sure you have removed any buildup and wiped down the fixtures.
Clean the mirrors, medicine cabinet and any vents or light fixtures in the bathroom. Make sure you don't use mirror cleaner with ammonia in it. Check to make sure the light fixtures are clean and that the light bulbs work. Again, throw those glass light fixture covers in the dishwasher.
Sweep and mop the bathroom floor. Be especially careful around the toilet.
Repeat for each bathroom.

, Wipe down any closet shelves provided and clean any mirrors. If you have carpet, you should treat any spots and then vacuum the carpet. If you do not have carpets, you should mop. If floors are wooden, use an oil soap. Repeat for each bedroom.

, Clean the windows and wash the blinds. Clean the blades of the ceiling fan and/or any light fixtures in the room. Replace all burnt out light bulbs, and if the place still looks dark and dingy, upgrade to brighter bulbs. Spot treat any spots on the carpet. Vacuum or mop the floors.

, Be sure that outside lights are working. Put garbage cans on curb, if appropriate, for pickup.

,, Send the photos and a written description to the landlord or property manager and ask them to sign off on it. Send one to yourself at the same time and leave the package unopened. If the landlord or property manager won't sign off, the postmark on the envelope may help prove the date of the cleanliness of the apartment upon leaving.

, Be sure to get a copy of the move-out inspection for your records.

Think about where you're going to park.,
Look for public transportation.,
Consider your commute if you have to spend a lot of time on the road.,
See what the view is.,
Find out what's in the neighborhood, the distance to the nearest park, especially if you have a dog to walk, whether a grocery store is within walking distance, and how far you'll have to travel for a good cup of coffee or a hamburger.,
Ask if the building is locked.,
Gauge how noisy an apartment is likely to be.,
Research the age of the building.,
Meet your prospective neighbors.",How to Choose an Apartment Building,"


Look for reserved spaces near your building or in a parking lot adjacent to your building.
Consider the availability of street parking. Parking on the street and walking past cute little shops to get to your building seems like a good idea on a nice day, but think about how you will feel late at night when it is raining or snowing heavily and no nearby spaces are available.;
, Just as you have to consider how far you're willing to walk to your car, the distance to the nearest bus stop or subway matters, especially if you're going to be doing things like carrying groceries.

, Driving a long distance to your job or being stuck in rush-hour traffic will leave you less time to enjoy your apartment. You might also find that spending significantly more money on gas or cab fares make a closer apartment a better choice.

, Apartments in buildings that offer a view of a park will be more expensive than those that can only offer views of the back of a strip mall, but the difference may be worth it if a terrible view discourages you from opening the blinds and letting in some sunshine.

, Think about all the places you go most often and look for a building that's near as many of them as possible.

, The slight inconvenience of having to stop and use your key to enter the building is often worth the peace of mind you get from knowing that you won't be easy prey for criminals, door-to-door salespeople and those who would hang take-out menus on your doorknob.

,


If your building houses the indoor pool, gym or party room, you may experience more noise than you can tolerate.
A building that's too close to the freeway or to commercial buildings that take early deliveries also experience a lot of noise.
Elevators can be noisy, as can exit doors to stairways. If your apartment is near the entrance, you will have to listen to neighbors walking past your door at all hours.

, An older building may result in higher premiums for your renter's insurance because it isn't up to the latest safety codes.

, An apartment may be a great deal because the building is near the local college and full of partying, noisy students. It may be the last resort for troublesome tenants who'd been evicted from better places. Or your neighbors may be perfectly nice people who you don't have anything in common with. These are all reasons to choose another building.

Take a flat removal box, tape and a tape gun.,
Fold the box into a cube, find the bottom of the removal box.,
Have the box sitting upright standing on the open end.,
Pack your items.",How to Construct Removal Boxes,";
, Often the instructions for putting the box together are printed on the box itself. Generally, however, you shape the box into a square by standing it upright and opening it out.


Fold the base flaps across, the lower flaps facing one another should be folded first and then the higher flaps facing each other should be folded next.
Some boxes allow you to tuck the box flaps in at the end to secure them but most removal boxes require taping, as discussed next.

, The closed flaps (base) end should be facing upwards.


Use the tape gun (loaded) to tape the base flaps up.
Place the sticky end of the tape gun on one side of the box and pull the tape back across the gap between the flap joint.
Break off the tape once it reaches the other side.
Repeat several times until the box base feels strong.

, Once packed, seal the top of the box using the tape gun again, with the same manner described above.


Sometimes it might be necessary to tape around the whole box as well, depending on the fragility, heaviness, or shape of the items packed. Use your own sense of judgment here.

Decide what kind of pond you want.,
Choose a location for your pond.,
Consider the size and depth of your pond.",How to Make a Pond1," What function will it serve? Think about the features you’d enjoy most as you begin constructing plans. The most common backyard ponds fall into one of the following categories.A wildlife pond is perhaps the easiest type of pond to construct. It doesn’t require a pump, so it needn’t be close to a source of electricity. A wildlife pond is built to look like a natural part of the landscape. Because it isn’t stocked with fish, it is attractive to frogs, slugs, water sliders, and other animals that may come to it to have a drink or bathe away.
A garden pond is more ornamental in appearance. Garden ponds typically have lily pads and other aquatic plants, and are built to complement the design of one’s garden. Artfully arranged stones, small pump-based waterfalls, and a smattering of goldfish are often features of garden ponds.;
, Most ponds do best in spots that get mixed sun and shade, since this environment allows plants to grow and keeps algae at bay. You may want to locate the pond in a place you can see from your home, so you can enjoy it even in cold or rainy weather.If you’re constructing your pond in the backyard, the first thing to do is call your gas and electric company and ask them to come to your house and mark the locations of your gas and electric lines, so you’ll know not to dig in those spots.
If you have a larger property, other considerations may be involved. Call the Department of Agriculture to find out if there are places on your property that are protected watersheds, and ask if there are any other local regulations you should know about before you begin digging.
Don’t choose a spot too close to trees, as you may damage their root systems.

, If you live in a wet region, such as in the eastern region of the United States, your pond can be just a few feet wide and deep. If you’re in a dryer regions, like the southwest region of the US, a shallow pond will evaporate quickly. Conduct research to find out what depth makes sense for your region.








Larger ponds are easier to to maintain. They’re more stable, so plants and other wildlife have a better chance of survival.
Use a rope to lay out the shape of your pond and get a sense of the size you want. Keep it in place to guide you as you begin to dig.

"
"
Dig the pond.,
Line the pond.,
Fill the pond.,
Create a slit around the edge of the pond.,
Add water from a local natural pond.,
Watch as your pond grows “wild.” Your pond will change over time, attracting bugs and other creatures as it develops nutrients.",How to Make a Pond2," For a small size pond, digging with a shovel should be sufficient. Keep these factors in mind as you dig:








Since you want to facilitate the growth of wildlife, your pond should be deep enough that it won’t freeze solid over the winter. If you’re in an area that gets cold, you’ll want to dig the pond several feet deep so that the animals living there can live overwinter.
One side of the pond should have a gradual slope, a beach of sorts, so that animals that wander in will be able to make their way out. Animals can drown in ponds with steep cliffs on every side.
Reserve the topsoil in a pile as you dig. You’ll be using this later when you edge the pond.
When you’re finished digging, remove sharp rocks from the hole.

, First line the pond with a layer of sand, making sure to cover every crevice. Next add a layer of biodegradable or man-made materials. You can use newspapers or burlap, but biodegradable materials may rot in time, effectively leaving you with no protection other than the layer of sand. Stones may force their way up through this sand layer and damage the liner. So consider non-biodegradable material such as specialist pond underlay as an option. When you've placed this layer down, cover it with a large piece of waterproof pond liner.Different types of waterproof pond liners are available at home improvement stores, and often at garden stores.

, Use a hose to fill the pond up to the edge, making sure to stop before it overflows.You may also fill the pond with collected rainwater if you’d prefer not to use pumped water.








Trim the overlapping liner back to about eight to ten inches (20 to 25 cm).

, Lift back the pond liner and use a spade to cut a 6-inch (16 cm) slit into the earth around the entire pond. Insert the spade a few inches into the slit, maneuver it so it is parallel to the ground, and gently lift the grass around the entire slit, creating a sort of grass flap around the entire pond. Now lift back the grass flap and tuck the edges of the pond liner into the slit, replacing the grass flap over the top to conceal the slit as you go. This gives the pond a “natural” edge, which will be inviting to the wildlife in your area., Take a few empty milk gallons or other closed containers to a healthy pond nearby. Look for a natural pond that has been there for many years, as opposed to a neighbor’s backyard pond. Fill the containers with pond water, taking care not to capture any fish in the process. Return to your pond and add the natural pond water, which contains bacteria and microscopic animals that will help establish your pond as a more natural water source for wildlife.,









Don’t mow the area around your pond; instead, let wild grasses grow.
Don’t introduce fish to the pond for several years. Their presence will prevent the pond from attracting frogs, snails, and other wildlife.
Create a muddy pond bottom by dumping the topsoil back into the pond. You may plant reeds and other natural aquatic plants, such as water lilies, to help facilitate the growth of other wildlife. Just be sure to monitor it to keep it from becoming stagnant, as this could lead to a foul smell and increased mosquito activity.

"
"
Dig the pond.,
Line the pond.,
Install the pump and other devices.,
Edge the pond.,
Fill the pond.,
Create an aquatic garden.,
Add a few goldfish.",How to Make a Pond3," A garden pond often has multiple levels, to facilitate a waterfall and provide a place for a pump. If you choose to install electric devices the pond should be located close enough to your home that you’ll have access to electricity. Use a shovel to dig a large hole according to the size and depth you have chosen.








If you plan to install a pump, dig a second deeper hole of about 10 inches at the center of the pond.
Create a second level for aquatic plants by digging a shallower shelf around the perimeter of the pond.
You may also use a preformed pond shape, available at garden stores. These are often shaped like a bean and have multiple levels. If you’re using a preformed pond, adjust the hole you dig to its proportions.

, First line the pond with a layer of sand, making sure to cover every crevice. Next add a layer of biodegradable materials, such as newspapers or burlap. Cover this layer with a large piece of waterproof pond liner. This should cover the entire pond and the edges around it., If you’re including a pump, install it in the deeper center pit so that the hose extends to the surface of the pond. You may also install a filter or a skimmer. Consult with the manufacturer of the device you choose for detailed instructions on how to install it. Always make sure the pump is on its own circuit and plugged into a GFCI receptacle.Do not put the pump directly on the ground as this will make the pump subject to dirt and debris that falls into the pond because it is in the deepest area. Elevate the pump with a bucket or a garden pot by at least 3 in. (8.62 cm).

, Trim pond liner so that it overlaps the edge of the pond by about eight inches (20 cm). Dig a shallow shelf under the liner, lay the liner edges flat, and set heavy, flat stones on top of the liner around the edge of the pond. Large stones and flagstone work well for this purpose.








Make sure the stones are set a few inches into the ground, so that they will be level with the surface of the pond when it is filled.
If the stones are large and heavy, it is not necessary to mortar them. If you’re using smaller, lighter stones, you may want to add mortar to prevent them from coming loose when people stand at the pond’s edge.
If you’re installing a waterfall device, it is attractive to surround it with stones.
Be creative here: you may create patterns with stones, or use stones of varying shapes, sizes, and colors to accent your garden.

, Use a hose to fill the pond about three quarters of the way full to prevent overflowing from water features when turned off. Test the pump and other electronic devices you installed to make sure they are working properly.







, Add lily pads, reeds, and other aquatic plants to your pond. Every plant has individual requirements, so make sure the environment you have created is the right one for the plants you choose to grow. For example, some plants don’t do well with movement, so they shouldn’t be situated directly in the flow of a waterfall., Go to your local pet store and buy some goldfish to add to the pond. Do some research to find out what types of plants they coexist well with. Don’t add too many, or they may cause the aquatic plants to deteriorate.If you strike the right balance between plants and fish, you shouldn’t need a filter in your pond. If you have a lot of fish, you might consider installing a filter to take care of their waste.
Koi are different from goldfish, and they require a special kind of pond. Read How to Build a Koi Fish Pond for more information.

, Work out how much you can afford to pay in rent or how much you can borrow from the bank in the form of a mortgage. If you can afford to buy your own home outright, lucky you!

, Consider your work, your partner's work location, where your children go to school, or will go to school in the future. Do you want your home to be close to other family members or friends? Choose an ideal location but remain flexible.

, Again, be flexible. Few people find exactly what they what, where they want it, and at a price they can afford. You will almost certainly have to compromise.

, Make sure there is enough space. Many people have a house that the family grows out of, or never grows into. Consider the future and your unique situation, to be sure you won't regret your choice. Children may not want to share a bedroom in the future. You may need less space when your children leave home. Do you have to have a large garden? Is a garage critical?

, In the UK, get a professional structural survey, in other countries find the appropriate expert and have them inspect your potential new home.

,, Do you need a big kitchen, walk-in wardrobes, good storage space, multiple bathrooms? A separate lounge and dining room suits some people, while others like an open living space.

, Investigate the crime rate in the neighborhood and find out about the costs of home, home contents, and car insurance rates, as these are all indicative of crime rates in the area.

, Is there a busy road nearby? Is the house in a fire or flood risk area? Are there risks from animals such as snakes, possums rats or even bears? Is there a danger of termites or other destructive insects?

, Do you need to live near a hospital, close to shops, or within reach or an airport, etc.?

, Choose a house that makes you feel happy. Wow factor is a luxury not everyone can afford, be reasonable.

, Do you want green spaces, the city, village life, or to be near the sea?

, You need to know you'll be able to afford to live in the home for the foreseeable future, in a variety of circumstances.

, You need to be objective and not just look at the good things. At first, it may seem flawless; but look harder. Be aware of the seasons; what about autumn and winter? Are those leaves and snow hiding something you need to fix? These invisible repairs for the future. The questions of ""it's pretty, but will it last?"" are important.

, Never settle on anything less simply because you're tired of searching. If you don't find the right house now, you will in the future. Something may be in your price range, but is it worth it? Is it a strong, sturdy house? Are you being unrealistic with prices? Will you be happy?

, The protractor will not only help you make an even circle, but will also mark the center of the circle for you. The center is where axle, or beam, will be placed in order to connect the 2 sides of the water wheel and allow the wheel to spin.

, The ""A"" should be 4 inches (10.16 cm) tall by 4 inches (10.16 cm) wide. At the very top middle point of the ""A"" shape, mark a small ""v"" shape; this will be the inlet that the axle is placed in. Outline an extra 2 � 2 1/2 inch (6.35 cm) long x 3/4 inch (1.905 cm) wide rectangles for the water wheel stand support.

,,, Make sure each paddle is positioned at a diagonal towards the center of the water wheel. Use the image of spokes on a bike to help with this positioning.

,,, Make sure it goes through both sides and sticks out of each side equally. Set the wheel aside.

, Do so by attaching the rectangular support beams to the left side of one of the ""A"" shapes, directly under the horizontal line across the middle of the shape. Do the same for the second support beam on the right hand side. Pin or glue the opposite ""A"" shape to the support beams that you have just attached to the first ""A"" shape to complete the support system.

, Place the axle in the ""v"" shaped grooves at the top of each ""A"" shape. This will allow your water wheel to spin.

Before you even begin packing up, start to get to know your new home.,
Keep in touch.,
Don’t push yourself or your feelings.,
Stay in a good mood when possible.,
Don't focus on minor, troubling details.,
Before moving, write about what you'll miss and what you're excited about.,
If you are a teen, purchase or ask your parents for a journal.,
Be honest with yourself.,
Agree upon a set time to talk with your family.,
Choose a few of your favorite family photos and place them in important areas of your new home.,
Keep your most cherished souvenirs/keepsakes.,
Get a job.,
Get involved in your new community.,
Embrace new challenges and celebrate successes.",How to Cope With Moving As a Teen or Young Adult," The Internet and library may contain lots of good information about the place you're moving to. Everything will feel much more familiar much more quickly and prepare you for the move.


Brainstorm your interests, talents, skills, hobbies, passions -things you enjoy- and find the locations, phone numbers, and other important information about the places where those activities take place. It could be a club at your new school, which would be great to help you adjust quickly.
When you're visiting your new school, find out if there are activities or clubs you're interested in and see if you can still join if the deadline hasn't already expired. It'll give you a great opportunity to meet new people and make friends. You could meet people who have similar interests as you.;
, One of the biggest fears of moving is losing friends and slowly becoming more and more distant. Being so far away means rarely seeing your friend anymore, and busy schedules make it difficult to contact one another, and there is always the factor of being replaced with a new friend, which can complicate things and ruin friendships.


Print out pictures of you and your friends together and put them in your room. Print some copies for your friends as well. This will help you remember one another and may comfort you when the prospect of moving gets you down. Constantly seeing these photos is a gentle reminder that your friends will always be there for you.
There are many forms of communication for staying in touch. Share pictures and videos. Let your friends know about the differences, both good and bad, between your old home and your new place, and update them on the most interesting things that have occurred. Call and text one another frequently, if possible. You might be able to plan visits during summer, spring or winter break for you to visit your friend or for them to visit you.

, Remember to give yourself time to adjust and feel better in general. Don't pressure yourself to know how you feel about the move, this does nothing but shove a big reminder in your face that the move has been difficult. While it is completely okay to feel sad or upset at times, it is essential let this thought or feeling go away by itself without clinging to it. There is no need to ponder about it or excessively think about it, either.

, Find new hobbies, go to new places an meet different people. Try to find positive experiences to build a positive feeling about the new home and keep your mind of the difficulty of moving. Staying home and being moody about it will not change the facts, and it will only make you more upset.


Make the best your current situation and move on. Don't live in the past, it will only make the move more jarring and it won't help you at all. Remember what's important, and relive memories that make you smile. You can relive your past, but make sure it keeps you in a positive mood.

, Always stay calm and don't allow small things to send you over the edge. Ignore things like the moving boxes that have to be unpacked, your home in chaos, etc. These can tick you off, since they a constant reminder of the change you're going through.


Think of this as a temporary situation which is going to be over soon. It will just be replaced by something even better. Know that moving can be hard, but it'll make way to a better situation and perhaps after needing some time to cope, could make you happier than you were at your old home.
Consider it a fresh start. With a clean slate, you can change everything and improve as well. If you had issues with other people, you are now rid of these problems and can avoid repeating this conflict. With past mistakes, you can use your mistakes to become a better, new person. You can recreate your reputation and make it better.
Think of it as a new opportunity to let go of all the worries and stress you had living at your current home. It could be an opportunity to start all over, making a new, more successful new beginning. It simply takes changing your thoughts from negativity to trying to find the good in every situation.

, This a great exercise to do with your whole family or on your own. Make a list about what you will miss about your old home and what you look forward to. The first part, about missing home, is a great way to de-stress and get your feelings out in a calm way. The second part will build up your optimism and get you feeling a little better about your move, knowing that there are positive factors in it, while being honest at the same time by acknowledging that you will miss home.


If your whole family each makes a separate list, come together and discuss it. This will give you the feeling that others understand what you are going through and that you are not alone. Compare what you will miss and what you are excited for. With a little work and creativity, you may be able to find that what you miss might be replaced by something even better in your new home.

, A ""moving journal"" is a great place for you to express how you feel about this major change in a private, non-judged, and honest way. You can let everything out onto the paper whether it be by writing, drawing, or anything else. Whatever lets you express your emotions freely will work great.


Before moving, add in pictures of friends, the neighborhood and home. It can be a type of scrapbook that you can look back on when you've moved into their new home. Look at this scrapbook when you feel nostalgic or are missing home, or if you are feeling upset about the move, add an entry to the journal.

, Sometimes you sugarcoat your move without realizing it – promising yourself that life will be so much better at the your new home. This is done in hopes of distracting yourself from the negative feelings and hard reality. But doing this can raise your expectations unrealistically and set yourself up for disappointment later on.


While too much sugarcoating can be set up for disappointment, keeping positive is key. Have realistic expectations and don't change reality. Search for the best in your situation instead and try to remain optimistic.

, Try not to text, instead use the phone, or if available, a video chatting program or app, such as FaceTime or Skype. Depending on your personal preferences and schedule, this may be daily, weekly or monthly. At first, it's better to schedule more frequent chats, even if they feel excessive, and slowly back off and reduce the chat time as you feel more comfortable in your new home.


Having a planned time to hear from your family gives you peace of mind, knowing you will soon talk to your family regardless of your busy schedule or anything else that may be difficult to handle. It will comfort you knowing that your family is still there for you even when you aren't with them.
Take advantage of technology based communication. Emailing, texting, or using social media allows you to check on your family when it is convenient for you, allowing you to feel connected even if you are far apart physically.

, Try to put them where you'll see them often, such as your room or your hallway.


If you enjoy crafting or it is your specialty, create a photo collage of your family instead of using framed photos, whether it be digitally (you can set it as your wallpaper) or handmade.
Seeing the familiar faces of your family provides a sense of closeness and helps you still feel connected to them, as if they are there with you.

, These meaningful and precious items will provide comfort when you start to miss your family. Before you leave home, pack your most valued keepsakes (for example, family pictures, old birthday cards, toys from your childhood, etc.). These should all be things that remind you of “home sweet home.”


Once you arrive at your new home, decorate your home or room with those keepsakes. When you start missing your family, pull out one of them. While you may feel homesick at first, eventually you will adjust and feel like yourself again.
These keepsakes can be anything, no matter how small or insignificant they seem. If they are significant to you, it is enough.

, Even if you do not technically need a job, still try to find one. Because work takes up a lot of your time, it will distract you, so you are not sitting around, alone and sad, missing your family. It will also help you meet new people and make new friends. Working will also help you feel more productive, which could motivate you to try to achieve your goals.


If you are unable to work, school/college will achieve the same purpose. Enroll in some classes at your local college, go back to earn a degree, and you will be so distracted with coursework, homework and friends to have time to sit around and brood.

, Battle loneliness and homesickness by keeping busy. Join a social group, club, volunteer organization, gym or sporting team in your city. By participating in these activities you can do what you enjoy, meet new people, and make new friends.


Before moving, do a little research on your town to find out more about what it has to offer. For example, if are a hiker, find out where your town's best parks are. If you enjoy reading, find out if there's a pleasant bookstore in the neighborhood or a cozy library.
When you arrive in your new community you will already have ideas of how to spend your free time, rather than just brooding about how much you miss home and your family.

, While being away from your family can be difficult, it is important to focus on yourself and your freedom. Though challenges can be difficult or thought of as negative, they can also be very fulfilling to overcome. Moving away from your family will push you to your limits, but know that by sooner or later, you will be a better person because of it.


Celebrate every success you have, no matter how small it is. You don’t always have to share this victory with someone. It’s yours and you're not obligated to tell everyone.
Write down the successes in a journal and look back on it when you feel challenged or can’t move forward. Perhaps you were really nervous about meeting your new co-workers and beginning your new job, but they all greeted you with open arms and your work day was great. Remind yourself that you are capable of rising above your challenges.

Examine the fountain for signs of wear.,
Keep your outdoor fountain's pump in good working order.,
Scrub the surface area of the fountain.,
Replenish the water in your fountain regularly.",How to Maintain Outdoor Fountains," Because your fountain is out in the elements all day, it's going to suffer the effects of Mother Nature. Dirt, wind, animals and precipitation all can affect your fountain's operation, so it's important to make frequent checks to ensure it's running properly.;
, The pump is the single most important piece of equipment in your fountain. If it's not working or working at reduced capacity, shut it off and remove it before making repairs. Look for obstructions and other signs of wear about once a month.


Remove leaves and other debris from the pump's intake valve and housing. With the pump taken out of the fountain, wipe it clean with a damp cloth. Use a toothbrush to scrub hard-to-reach areas.
Flush the pump and hose lines if they appear to be clogged.
Replace filters or damaged components as necessary.

, Outdoor fountains can be dirtied by a variety of factors. Algae blooms, animal waste and mineral deposits can foul the water in your fountain and affect its appearance. Take steps to neutralize these conditions.


Algae: The tiny organism can flourish in outdoor fountains, particularly in direct sunlight during the peak summer months. Gently scrub it away with a diluted bleach mixture. Thoroughly rinse the fountain afterward. You also can add all-natural products to the water to keep algae in check. These items are rich in enzymes that inhibit algae growth but do no harm pets or other animals.
Animal waste: Birds are frequent visitors to outdoor fountains, and while they're often bright additions to the landscape, they can be messy. Wipe bird droppings away with a damp sponge but try not to use soap. Consider replacing the water, too.
Mineral deposits: Hard-water stains often appear on the fountain surface as crusty, white buildups. Scrub these off with white vinegar and allow the fountain wash the deposits away.

, Experts suggest changing the water in an outdoor fountain at least once a week. Mix in additives designed to inhibit algae growth and deposit buildups with each water change. Fresh water helps keep the system running smoothly and makes the fountain inviting to wildlife.

Purchase a small water pump and plastic tubing.,
Buy a container.,
Fill the bowl with tap water.,
Put rocks, marbles, or beads inside the bowl to cover the water pump.,
Add decorations to your fountain.,
Turn on the pump and adjust the water flow and the position of the rocks until you are satisfied with how it functions and looks.,
Maintain the fountain.",How to Make a Tabletop Fountain," They can be found in garden, hardware, and aquarium stores, and also on the Internet. Choose a water pump with suction cups on the bottom so it stays in place when in the fountain. The plastic tubing is used to direct where the water goes. The most common size is 5/8” outer diameter and 1/2” inner diameter.;
, Your container can be made out of ceramic, glass, plastic, or metal. Clay containers that are not already sealed need to be sealed or lined with plastic. To make a fountain in a basket, you can put a waterproof container inside the basket and hide it with rocks or plants.

, Keep the water level above the water pump. Then, turn on the pump to make sure it is working.

, Be creative with this step. You could also use a fountainhead, such as a lava rock, shell, or copper elbow. If the object does not already have a hole in it, you can drill a hole.

, For example, you could put in plants, candles, figurines, crystals, a mirror, or glass trinkets. Have fun with this step to make your fountain really personalized.

, To change the sound of the water, you can increase or decrease the water flow, or put rocks in the path of the water.

, Add fresh water when the water level is low. Every three months, take apart the fountain and clean the pump. If there is algae, put bleach in the water. If you like, you can rearrange the fountain when you put it back together, or try different decorations.

Gather your materials.,
Prepare the base.,
Drill and file the pots and saucers.,
Assemble the main fountain.,
Assemble the rest of the fountain.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Make a Water Fountain1," You'll need a 14"", 7"", 6"", and three 4"" terra cotta saucers. You'll also need 6"" and 4"" flower pots, a fountain pump, 1/2"" rubber tubing, silicone sealant, clear spray sealant, a round file, and a drill with a masonry bit., Spray the inside of the 14"" saucer with the spray sealant. Do three coats in total, with dry time between them.

, Soak the rest of the flower pots and saucers to make them easier to shape and drill. Drill a 1/2"" hole for the rubber tubing in the 7"" saucer, with a wood block underneath it for support. Then file four notches in the lips of the 6"" pot and one of the 4"" saucers. File downward angle large notches in the 7"", 6"", and one of the 4"" saucers. These will be the downspouts.

, With the pump on the 14"" saucer, attach the rubber tube to the pump and then then side it up through the hole at the bottom of the 6"" pot (with the pot upside down). Arrange the pot so that the cord for the pump goes through one of the notches on the lip of the pot. Now place the 7"" saucer on top, facing up. Trim the extra tube, leave about a 1/2"", and then seal the edges around the tube with silicone.

, Place the 4"" flower pot upside down and top it with the 6"" saucer, and the 4"" saucer with the lip on top of the 4"" saucer with no cuts. Arrange the saucers and pots so that the downspouts pour into each other. Finally, place the 4"" saucer with the notches upside down so that it covers the hole with the tube.


Water should flow up from the bottom, pour out the 7"" saucer, into the 6"" saucer, into the 4"" saucer, and then back into the 14"" saucer so that the process can start again. The notches allow for water flow, so if you're having circulation problems, try making the notches bigger.
You may need to stabilize the fountain by gluing these components together, or by lashing them down with twine.

, Fill your saucers with river stones or other flow-friendly materials, and then add plants or other decorations to your fountain. Enjoy!

Get a nice, large bowl or pot.,
Get and cut your bamboo to size.,
Assemble your platform.,
Assemble the fountain.,
Add water and start the pump.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Make a Water Fountain2," This will be the main part of your water feature. A wide opening is important here. , You'll need 3/4"" diameter bamboo cut long enough to fit over the opening of your pot. You'll also need a larger ~2"" diameter piece of bamboo, cut to about 6"" in length. Miter one end of this piece to create the spout.

, Using twine or string, lace the three narrow pieces of bamboo together into a platform which can be fit over the back half of the pot. Attach the larger piece of bamboo to the platform using glue, but attach it at an angle (using a wedge) so that the spout is angled down towards the center of the pot slightly.

, Place the pump at the bottom of the pot. Connect the tube and run it up and behind the platform. Place the end of the tube in the bamboo spout so that it goes about 2"" in, and then tape the tube in place against the pot (not anywhere that will get wet).

, Add water into the pot and then start your pump. Everything should be working. Now you just have to make it pretty!

, Fill the bottom of the pot with river rocks and add some fake plants around the spout to cover up evidence of the pumps. Enjoy your new fountain!

Get a large decorative bowl or pot.,
Get shells.,
Drill the hole.,
Assemble the pump.,
Seal the tube.,
Finish the fountain.,
Add water and turn on the pump.",How to Make a Water Fountain3," It should be glass or something else that is waterproof. It should not have any holes or method for water to escape.

, You'll most importantly need a large whelk or conch seashell. The rest of the seashells can be random jumbles. You'll also probably want some river or beach rocks.

, You'll need to run a tube from the pump and into the large shell. Get a rotary tool with a ceramic drill bit and start with the smallest size, then work your way up until the hole is large enough to fit the tube through. This will probably be around 3/4"". If you run out of rotary bits that are large enough, use a round file to get the hole to size.


Sand the hole smooth afterward to remove any glass burrs and rough edges.

, Place the pump in the bottom of the bowl. Attach a rubber tube to the pump and then fit the other end into the large shell.

, Use silicone sealant around the opening to make it watertight and help keep the tube in place. Allow the sealant to set.

, Cover the pump in rocks and then shells or other waterproof decorative items. Set the large shell on top and angle the spout slightly downward.

, You're done! Enjoy your fountain!

Choose a clear bottle.,
Fill the bottle with water.,
Add ten drops of liquid soap to the container.,
Shake the bottle.,
Look for suds.,
Gradually shake in more soap.,
Look for soap scum.,
Decide whether to soften your water.",How to Determine if You Have Hard Water1," This test will only give a very rough estimate of water hardness, but it only takes a few minutes. Start with a bottle that can hold at least 12 ounce (360 mL), and preferably more. If you can't find a bottle with a cap, use any clear container., Measure 12 ounces (360 mL) of your tap water and pour it into the container.

, Some soaps react to hard water more than others, which is one reason this test isn't always accurate. Many dishwashing detergents do not react much to hard water, so it may be best to use liquid hand soap for this test.Castile soap is a common choice, since its simple ingredient list ensures that other chemicals are not interfering with the results., Cap the bottle and shake it for a few seconds. If your container doesn't have a cap, stir vigorously until the soap is thoroughly mixed into the water.

, Open the bottle and look for suds at the top of the water. If there are plenty of suds, your water is probably quite soft.If there are only a few bubbles, move on to the next step.

, Add more soap five or ten drops at a time, shaking the bottle after each batch. The number of drops it takes to make suds will give you a rough estimate of your water hardness:20 drops: slightly hard
30 drops: moderately hard
40 drops: hard
50+ drops: very hard

, Completely soft water creates foam at the surface, but leaves the water itself clear. The minerals in hard water react with soap to create ""soap scum."" Besides reducing foam, this scum makes the water look cloudy. If you water is thick with soap scum, your water is almost certainly hard.

, A result of ""moderately hard"" or below typically won't cause major problems in your household.If your water doesn't seem too hard but you are noticing problems, read below for DIY solutions or more accurate tests.

Plan the location of your pond to take advantage of shady areas in your yard.,
Construct or retrofit your pond so that water from your yard cannot flow into it.

,
Install a fine bubble aerator.,
Use water plants to help keep sunlight off of the waters surface.,
Include submersible plants such as Elodea that uses the nutrients that algae need to grow.

,
Introduce aquatic pond snails to your pond.,
Add tadpoles to your pond.,
Feed your fish only as much food as can be eaten within about five minutes.,
Clean the filters in your filtration system regularly.,
Use an ultraviolet light sterilizer.,
Clean the surface of your pond with a skimmer or algae net.

,
Vacuum the algae from the pond with a pond vacuum.

,
Place barley straw in a location that provides a good flow of water and sunlight.,
Color the water using a dye made specifically for treating pond water.",How to Get Rid of Algae in Ponds," Be careful not to locate your pond under a tree, however, as trees can drop leaves and sap that can play havoc with your pond water.;
,, The main cause of algae bloom is the lack of water movement. Air rises. By installing a fine bubble aerator at the deepest section of the pond and aerate the pond 24/7, you create a natural water movement in the pond, it produces a healthier environment for the fish while eliminating harmful algae at the same time.

, Water Hyacinth, Water Lilies, and Lotus are all good choices.

,, Pond snails dine on the algae in your pond.

, Tadpoles not only eat algae but also eat mosquito and other insect larvae.

, Food not eaten will decay and contribute to algae growth.

, Clogged filters can kill beneficial bacteria and allow algae to flourish.

, These sterilizers break down the cell walls of the algae, killing it.

,,, The barley straw will decompose adding hydrogen peroxide to the water, killing the algae.

, The dye will color the water making it dark and harder for sunlight to penetrate to the depths of your pond.

Check for white scale.,
Examine your laundry.,
Look for spots and etching on your glassware.,
Deal with shower problems.",How to Determine if You Have Hard Water2," The minerals in hard water can leave a white scale on your sink, shower, or bathtub. If it's happening there, it's probably happening in your pipes as well. This is one problem with no do-it-yourself fix, and probably requires installing a water softener. If left alone, the hard water will slowly clog your pipes, reducing water pressure and shortening the lifespan of your plumbing.If the scale is minor and your pipes seem to function fine, however, you may want to solve specific problems using the cheap solutions below.

, The soap scum that forms in hard water can cling to fabric, leaving it stiff and rough. In severe cases, it can fail to clean the clothes completely, making white fabric grey and bright colors dull, or even leaving a sour odor on the clothes.Try one or more of the following solutions:Increase the washing machine temperature.
Use more detergent.
Add non-precipitating water conditioner to your machine before the detergent.

, One obvious sign of hard water is white spots on your glasses after washing. There are actually two types of damage that hard water can cause:Hard water spots are surface stains that you can remove by scrubbing with vinegar or an abrasive cleaner such as baking powder.
""Etching"" permanently damages the glass, although you may be able to buff it out with a glass polishing kit. Mild etching looks like a rainbow film, while severe etching turns the glass opaque.
To reduce the chance of either type of damage, reduce the temperature of the dishwasher or rinse your dishes more thoroughly before loading the machine.

, Particularly hard water may irritate skin, leave hair stiff and dull, or even leave a filmy soap residue on your skin. If you don't want to install a household water softener system, try these fixes:


Install a showerhead water softener and replenish it occasionally by adding salt. (Showerhead ""softeners"" that don't need salt are actually filters, and will not soften your water.)
To improve your hair texture, use a chelating shampoo once a week, followed by a moisturizing conditioner. Chelating shampoos are supposed to strip minerals from your hair, and typically contain the ingredient ""EDTA"" (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)."
"
Understand water hardness units.,
Contact your local water company.,
Ask a water softener company for a free test.,
Test your water with a test strip.,
Test with a water hardness titration kit.,
Send your water to a professional water testing lab.",How to Determine if You Have Hard Water3," An official report or a scientific test should give you a precise measurement. These are the most common units in most regions, so learn how to interpret the results:Grains Per Gallon (or just ""grains""): 3.5 – 7.0 means moderately hard. Anything higher will likely cause problems.
ppm, mg/L, or American degree of hardness: 60–120 means moderately hard.

, Your water provider may be able to tell you the hardness of your water supply., Many of these companies offer a free water test, hoping you'll use their services. They may request a water sample and send back the results, or they may send a water hardness test to your home. Keep reading for instructions on how to use the test.

, You can buy these test strips online or where water softeners are sold. These are very simple to use: just dip a test strip in your water and watch it change color. The test strip label or an accompanying guide should tell you how hard your water is based on the color.


This is accurate enough for a household, but don't rely on it to make fine adjustments to a pool or other system that requires a specific hardness level., This more accurate test is available online or at some pool stores. Typically you fill a small bottle with water up to the mark on the side, then add a chemical from the kit drop by drop. The number of drops it takes to cause a color change will tell you the hardness of your water.


Other types of test with a digital display are typically intended for special situations, such as extremely soft water. These are more expensive and not necessary for household testing., Consider this more expensive option only if you need a detailed analysis of your water, including contaminants and exact minerals. If you have a well or other private water source, it's a good idea to have a sample tested at least once a year, although testing for contamination is more important than water hardness.You may also want your water tested if you run a spa or other business that relies on clean water.


If you're not sure how to find a lab that can test your water, ask for advice at a university agricultural extension.

Keep your fountain pump submerged in water at all times.,
Keep your fountain pump powered on constantly.,
Use distilled water in your water fountain.",How to Maintain Indoor Fountains1," This will help circulate the water in your fountain and keep it filtered, in addition to minimizing the growth of algae. Your fountain pump may also become dry and burn out if it is not submerged in water consistently.


Examine the water level around your fountain pump on a daily basis. This will allow you to become familiar with how often you need to add water to the fountain.
Add water to your fountain as needed. This factor will vary depending on the indoor climate in which the fountain is located. For example, if the fountain resides in a warm, dry indoor climate, you may need to add water to the fountain on a daily basis.;
, This will help keep your fountain water clean and prolong the life of your pump; as turning the power off and on continually may cause the motor in the pump to wear at a faster pace.


Ask a friend or family member to help maintain the water level in your fountain when you need to travel. This will prevent you from having to power off the fountain completely.

, Using distilled water is a natural way to keep your fountain clean and prevent algae growth; whereas tap water may contain minerals or other metals that can solidify and build up on the walls of your fountain and the pump.

, Stones will need to be cleaned before they are placed back into the fresh water.

,


Consult your fountain's manual or contact the manufacturer directly if you are unsure how to remove the pump safely from the fountain.

, Depending on the size of your fountain, you can either empty the fountain over a sink or use a shop-vac to remove the water.

,


Use a soft, non-abrasive sponge to avoid scratching or damaging the fountain's interior and working parts.
Clean the fountain, pump, and stones using a cleaning mixture of warm water and mild liquid soap, or use a commercial calcium lime removal product. For an all-natural alternative, spray distilled white vinegar on the fountain's interior and parts, then scrub using a wet sponge.
Use a toothbrush to clean any small, tough corners or spots that are hard to penetrate or reach with the sponge.
Use a soft, clean rag or cloth to dry and remove any excess cleaning mixture from the fountain's interior and parts.

,, The procedure for refilling your fountain will vary depending on its size.


Pour bottled, distilled water into your fountain or use tap water from a sink. Depending on the size of your fountain, you can refill the fountain from the inside of a sink or use a bucket to transport the water from the sink over to the fountain.

,


Observe the fountain for a few minutes to make sure the pump is properly re-installed, and that the fountain work efficiently.

Find an energy calculator to assess your current energy usage.,
Slay “energy vampires.” Most electronic devices and appliances draw energy when they’re plugged in -- even if they’re switched off.,
Replace your old light bulbs.,
Compost your kitchen scraps.,
Wash your laundry in cold water.,
Turn off the tap.,
Run ceiling fans instead of the air conditioner.",How to Create an Eco Friendly House1," Many sites have calculators that will automatically tally up the energy efficiency of your house. It is also helpful if the site can also produce a graph or tally that can demonstrate what your house's potential could be after making some minor changes.;
, Most Americans own 25+ electronic devices. You can cut your energy consumption by unplugging your appliances and devices when they’re not in use.You can also plug appliances and devices into power strips. Switching the strip off will prevent them from drawing power.
Set your computer to “sleep” or “hibernate” when you’re not using it. You can pick up right where you left off when you come back, but your computer will use a lot less energy.

, Old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs waste up to 90% of their energy as heat. New types of light bulbs, such as compact fluorescent (CFL) and LED bulbs, can dramatically slash your house’s energy consumption for light.In most cases, you don’t have to do a thing to your existing light fixtures. Just buy different bulbs and swap them out!


CFLs are like the fluorescent bulbs in supermarkets, but they’re shaped in a small coil and are about the same shape and size as incandescent bulbs. They last about ten times as long as an incandescent bulb. They’re usually a little bit more expensive, but they pay for themselves within a year.
CFLs are a good choice for most home lighting situations. However, they usually cannot be dimmed, and they waste a lot of their energy when used in recessed or “can” lights. Because CFLs contain a small (but rarely dangerous) amount of mercury, they must be disposed of carefully. The Environmental Protection Agency has full instructions on their website.LEDs last up to 35 times longer than an incandescent bulb, and between 2-4 times longer than CFLs. LEDs are cool to the touch, so they don’t use much energy at all. However, they are usually still more expensive than either incandescent or CFL bulbs.LEDs are a good choice for most home lighting situations. Unlike incandescent and CFL bulbs, LEDs emit “directional” light, meaning the light is focused in a specific direction (like a spotlight). They are a great choice for recessed lighting. Only Energy Star-certified LED bulbs are specifically designed to replicate the omnidirectional light of a traditional light bulb. Look for the Energy Star label to make sure that the LED bulbs you buy give you the look you want.
Even better, open curtains and windows during daylight hours to use natural light. This can really cut power costs and also save loads of energy., Many things we throw away on a daily basis can be composted instead. Coffee grounds, fruit and vegetable peels, eggshells, even napkins and paper towels can be recycled to produce compost, which is great for gardens.Keeping food scraps out of landfills is good for the environment! It keeps them from building up methane gas (which is a major part of global warming) as they decompose in plastic trash bags, and it helps reduce the amount of waste in landfills.
Even if you live in an urban area, you can keep a compost bin on a balcony or porch. Many online retailers sell ready-to-go compost kits.

, 80-90% of the energy used when you run your washing machine comes from heating up the water for hot-water washes. Use the “cold water” or “eco” mode on your washing machine to save energy.Several companies, such as Tide, make eco-friendly cold water detergents. If your laundry has tough or frequent stains, these could be a good option to help your clothes get clean even in cold water.Look for natural detergents and stain removers, if you can. These are usually plant-based and biodegradable, making them much more eco-friendly., Most kids probably learn to brush their teeth while the water is running. Since dentists recommend that you brush your teeth for a full two minutes, that can add up to over 5 gallons of wasted water every time! Brush your teeth with the water off, and just turn on the tap to rinse., If you have ceiling fans, use them whenever possible to keep cool in the summer. Air conditioners can cost up to 36 times more to run than a ceiling fan. In the United States, air conditioning accounts for more than a quarter of the average home’s electricity use."

Install solar panels.",How to Create an Eco Friendly House2," A programmable thermostat can monitor your house temperature, keeping it warmer or cooler when you’re not there. For example, if you’re away during the day at work, a programmable thermostat can keep the inside temperature warmer than you’d usually keep it, and trigger the A/C only when you get home. Using one properly can save you up to $180 a year.Do some research before investing in a programmable thermostat. If yours isn’t easy to use, it might not end up saving you money or energy., Your old appliances, such as water heaters, refrigerators, and stoves, could be wasting a lot of energy. Replacing them with Energy Star-qualified products will ensure that your home uses less energy.There are often tax credits for replacing old, energy-inefficient products with new eco-friendly ones. The US Department of Energy has a full list of these credits here.If you can’t afford to replace your water heater, buy a specially designed insulating blanket and wrap it around the water heater. These blankets are available at most home improvement stores and take only a few minutes to install. This will help reduce wasted energy., Traditional toilets can use up to 7 gallons of water per flush. These water-guzzlers create a lot of waste. Look for “low flow” toilets to be eco-friendly.Look for toilets with the WaterSense label. These toilets use about 20% less water per flush than standard toilets., Showers account for about 17% of the average American’s indoor water usage. Swapping your old showerhead for a ""low flow"" or water-saving showerhead can reduce your water consumption by up to 2,900 gallons a year.Look for showerheads with the WaterSense label. These showerheads have been approved according to Environmental Protection Agency standards.

, A lot of energy can seep out through your attic and basement. Insulating these areas can reduce your home’s energy consumption. It can also cut your heating and cooling bills by making it easier to maintain a consistent temperature inside.GreenFiber cellulose insulation is an eco-friendly alternative to traditional insulation. GreenFiber is made of shredded recycled newspapers. It can be blown through small holes into walls, so it is easy to use when you’re remodeling. You can find a dealer at their website., Rather than buying new furniture, consider hitting up thrift shops and websites such as Craigslist and Freecycle. Recycling an old treasure rather than buying a new piece can save trees and your wallet., Traditional paints contain damaging volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can continue being emitted into your home’s atmosphere for 5 years after painting. Look for paints that are plant-based and water-borne.If you can’t find plant-based paints, try to find paints that are labeled “VOC-free.” Many large paint manufacturers, such as Benjamin Moore, produce VOC-free paint., If your budget won’t allow for replacing older, inefficient windows, insulating them can be a good option to make your home more energy efficient. It’s easy to insulate your windows and keep your home cozy year-round.Use caulking and weatherstripping around windows to stop air from seeping in (or out). This can cut heat loss in the winter and keep you cool in the summer.
Thermal or light-blocking window treatments can also help reduce energy waste by blocking sunlight. This is particularly helpful in hot climates.Make sure to use draught-stoppers at the bottom of doors, too. You can buy these at many retailers, or make your own.

, Motion-sensing lights are quite common outdoors, such as near garages or walkways. However, you can also install inexpensive motion sensors indoors. These will turn the lights on when you enter, and off when you leave a room. This could be very helpful if you have a hard time remembering to switch off the lights when you leave., You can buy a variety of solar-powered outdoor lights, from high-powered driveway floodlights to small walkway lamps. If you live in an area that gets a lot of sun during the day, these are a great way to cut your energy consumption and still have the lights on.Most home improvement stores will have a variety of solar lights, but you can also find them at many online retailers.

, Solar energy is clean and renewable. With many panels, surplus energy can be transferred to a battery and stored for later use. Installing solar panels can reduce your home’s carbon footprint, on average, by 35,180 pounds. That’s equivalent to the carbon dioxide absorbed by 88 trees. Investing in solar power will require some upfront cash, but it will pay off in the long run, for you and the planet.In some locations, you can even sell surplus solar energy to the local power grid.
Solar panels need to be wired into your home’s existing electrical grid. It is best to leave installation to professionals.
Many U.S. states and countries offer tax incentives if you install solar panels.

Drain the glycerin.,
Clean the pump.,
Perform the shake test.,
Mist wash.,
Remove water.,
Wait twelve hours.",How to Drain and Wash Your Biodiesel," Take your large plastic container and place it under the reaction tank of your biodiesel processor. You may need a few of these containers, depending on the size of the batch of biodiesel.


Unhook the hose from the processor.






Place it in the plastic container and open the valve on the bottom of the reaction tank. The dark glycerin will run out of the tank and into the container. This is the by-product of your reaction and you want to drain it out until you see the color change from black to amber. At that point, all of the glycerin has been drained and you're ready to transfer the fuel to the wash tank.





;
, Once all the glycerin has drained from the reaction tank and you have collected it in your containers, purge all the remaining glycerin from the pump by placing a bucket underneath the spout on the bottom of the pump and opening up the valve.


Start the transfer by turning on the pump. The oil will make its way up, from the processor to the wash tank. Wait several minutes as the wash tank fills up.







, Replace the bucket underneath the pump with an empty testing jar and open the valve on the pump.


Fill the jar with half water and half biodiesel.






Screw on the lid and give it three solid shakes. Set the jar on a flat surface and wait five minutes. While the shake test is not an absolute indicator of your fuel quality, you'll know if it will be an easy wash.






When the solution settles, you will see an intermediate layer called emulsion between the biodiesel and water. The smaller the layer, the easier your wash will be.







, There are a couple ways to wash your biodiesel. The mist wash is very effective in removing any leftover methanol, potassium hydroxide, glycerin or soaps from the reaction process. Using fine misting heads, begin adding water into the biodiesel. Looking down in the tank, you can see the misting process. As the mist washing begins, tiny water droplets fall through the biodiesel and bring all the leftover chemicals and catalysts to the bottom of the tank. After several wash cycles, the wash water will be very clear.

, Before you begin drying your biodiesel home-brew, all of the standing water must be removed from the drying tank. Depending on your processor style, you may need to transfer the ""wet"" biodiesel to another barrel to dry and prevent standing water from remaining in the tank.


Use a pump to circulate the biodiesel in the drying tank and spray it against the side of the tank to increase the surface area of the biodiesel. Use a small fan to move air across the surface of the biodiesel. This will cause water to evaporate more quickly. Make sure it is a gentle breeze as high velocity air will blow small droplets of biodiesel around the vicinity of the processor. You can also heat the biodiesel to cause it to dry more quickly.







, After this, your batch of biodiesel will be ready to transfer and use.

Locate the placement of all garden taps.,
Dig a hole beneath the garden tap.,
Test the tap.",How to Keep the Ground Dry Beneath a Garden Tap," This is best done for all taps that are located over soil, grass, or vegetation. If the tap is already on concrete, paving, or other hard surfaces, there's no need to bother with them.;
, Then, fill the hole with gravel. The size can be small, medium, or large, whatever is easiest to get.

, Allow some of the water to just pour onto the ground. You should find that the gravel will cause the water to drain away easily, and no mess will be left behind.

Replace old windows with energy-efficient windows.,
Install a skylight.,
Use sustainable flooring.,
Plant trees.,
Install a “cool roof.” Cool roofs reflect sunlight rather than absorbing it.,
Consider installing a composting toilet.,
Use durable siding.,
Talk with a design team about a “whole-house systems approach.” If you are designing a new home or doing extensive renovations on an older home, consider talking with a design team about a “whole-house systems approach.” This extensive approach considers many factors about your home, including local climate, your site’s specific conditions, your appliance needs, etc.",How to Create an Eco Friendly House3," If your house is older, your windows probably allow air to seep in. Single-paned windows don’t insulate as well as newer models. You can save up to $465 a year by replacing old single-pane windows with energy-efficient ones.In the U.S., several tax credits are available for replacing old windows with energy-efficient models. The US Department of Energy has a full list of these credits here., When chosen wisely, a skylight can provide beautiful natural light to your home while reducing your energy consumption. It’s important to consider your home’s position in order to maximize your skylight’s benefits. Consult a designer or architect.An eco-friendly skylight is more than a hole cut in the roof with some glass in it. Many energy-efficient skylights exist on the market, but they should always be professionally installed to make sure that they are safe and efficient.

, Hardwood floors add value and beauty to a home, but many of the trees used in hardwood flooring take years to grow. If your house is up for a new floor, consider using sustainable materials such as bamboo instead. Bamboo grows very quickly and takes less land to produce, but it’s still attractive and durable.


Cork is another sustainable wood flooring option. Cork is softer than bamboo, so it absorbs noise and feels cushiony underfoot. It is sometimes less durable than bamboo., Shade trees can reduce the amount of energy you spend to cool your house on hot summer days. If your property doesn’t already have shade trees, this is a step that will take some time before you see the full benefit.In addition to providing shade, trees absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide and release oxygen. A single tree can produce enough oxygen for four people in a single day.If you’re building a new construction home, try to work around existing trees. You could even incorporate them into your house design, such as building a deck under a huge shady oak.
Place deciduous trees (trees that shed their leaves annually) near the south and west sides of your home. This will help them block harsh afternoon sunlight in the summer, but let sunlight reach your home during the winter., This helps reduce your home’s energy consumption. It can also extend the life of your roof. These roofs are especially good for people who live in hot climates, since they reduce the need for air conditioning.Cool roof coatings are available at many home supply stores and warehouses. These coatings are like extremely thick paint and can be applied fairly easily. They are usually white or very light-colored with reflective pigments that reflect, rather than absorb, sunlight. (It is not recommended to apply cool roof coatings to shingle roofs.)
If you have a steep-sloped shingled roof, consider replacing your current shingles with cool asphalt shingles. These shingles have specially fabricated granules that reflect sunlight.
If you have a metal roof, it already reflects a lot of sunlight. However, these roofs absorb a lot of heat, which can increase your energy consumption in the summer. Painting your metal roof with a light color or using a cool roof coating can increase its energy efficiency.

, Composting toilets usually do not use water to “flush” like traditional toilets. They can also recycle many types of human waste into fertilizer that can be used in agriculture. While they are initially more expensive to install than traditional toilets, they are far more eco-friendly and will eventually pay for themselves.Composting toilets are usually easiest to install and maintain in a rural or suburban setting. If you live in an apartment or urban high-rise, it may more difficult to install and maintain a composting toilet.

, Materials such as cedar naturally repel pests and water. They are also durable and low-maintenance. Replace old aluminum siding with a more sustainable option.There are other eco-friendly siding options, such as fiber cement board and particle board. These are durable and sustainable. Look for products that have been manufactured without formaldehyde.

, Because it takes all these factors into account, a whole-house systems approach can drastically reduce your energy consumption.Many designers and architects have experience in whole-house systems approach construction. Visit the National Association of Home Builders for more advice on finding a design team."

Calculate your electrical needs.,
Consider the desired location for your panels.,
Look into the guaranteed service life.,
Consider add-ons.,
There are many forms of photovoltaic solar panels and deciding to spend a little more can gain an efficiency increase over less expensive panels.,
It will cost in the neighborhood of $10,000 USD for a solar system capable of 1kW output.",How to Buy Solar Panels," Check or estimate the power consumption required for any of the electrical appliances in your home that you would like to power. Most people use the energy generated from them to heat their water, since a water heater or air conditioning/heating units all, typically, consume a good amount of electricity. Make a list of the wattage ratings for any electrical appliances you might want to power with the solar panels. Add up all those wattage amounts. That will give you an idea of the amount of electricity you are consuming monthly – when using those particular devices and appliances.When selecting your panels, choose those with a slightly higher wattage rating than the amount you calculated from your list. This ensures that the ones you will be buying will have enough power output for your appliances.;
, This will affect how much you spend on the purchase – such as what kind you will need or how many may be necessary for the desired location. This will affect the money you spend to buy them. You want them to have maximum light exposure throughout the day. Usually, between the hours of 9am to 3pm is the best time. Installing them so that they are directly facing the sun (wherever the direction of the sun might be for your location) is the best location - when the sun is at its brightest. The more intense the light coming from the sun is, the more energy they can produce.

, How long will they last? Most last for about 10 to 15 years. Many people are under the assumption that they last forever. That is simply not true! Check your expenses to see if buying your panels will give you savings over such a period of time (10-15 years). You determine this when you:


Look at the estimated power consumption for the devices and appliances for each month. Then, multiply that number by 12 to get the estimated cost per year.
Now, multiply that number (the estimated cost per year) by the guaranteed service life of the panels to see what that potential savings would be and… whether or not the investment makes sense to you.

, These can help ensure maximum light collection. A solar tracker is an example of this, but it is an additional expense. Also, because the solar tracker is powered by electricity generated from the solar panels, the output of your panels will be lessened by the solar tracker’s power consumption. So, keep this in mind!

, Thin film PV panels are the most cost effective but are also the lowest efficiency. Polycrystalline PV panels are greater efficiency but also higher cost. The most efficient PV panel per unit size is Monocrystalline silicon panels which are made from a single ingot of crystal but have a very expensive manufacturing process making then the most expensive PV panels.

, This estimate may vary, as you need to consider the cost of panels, wiring, and other equipment, as well as installation costs.

Your list may be very short or very long. If you don't already have a few places in mind, then you will need to do more research in order to better understand what you're looking for., Run a web search, talk to people, and read guidebooks in order to learn more about each place that finds its way onto your list. Read about the history, the culture, the scenery, the economy. Try to pin down what it is, exactly, that draws you to this place.


Ask your friends. If you are considering moving to a city, and you know someone who has lived in that city before: be sure to ask this person for their perspective. Keep in mind that what works for one person does not always work for another!

, Look for the common factors between the places that you are considering living. Then, use these patterns to help yourself understand what sort of place, generally, you are looking for: urban, rural, or suburban; mountainous or seaside; east coast or west coast. Once you've identified a few similar options, try to parse out the more subtle differences between these places.


If you listed San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle, consider that these are all relatively young, affluent, tech-driven cities along the West Coast of the United States. Perhaps you are looking for a certain sort of energy that you identify with these particular urban centers. To narrow down your decision, examine the differences between these cities.
If you listed Montana, Alaska, and Colorado, then you probably want to live somewhere mountainous, outdoorsy, and relatively unpopulated. There are many similarities between these three states, but there are also many differences. Research each state to better understand the difference.

, If you are intrigued by the idea of a place, try to check it out in person before you make any serious decisions. Take any opportunity that you get to visit the area, speak with the people, and imagine yourself living there.If you are thinking of moving relatively nearby, then you can visit on a weekend or a day off. If you are thinking of living somewhere far away, then make sure that you have the time and resources to get there and back.

Divert the river.,
Lay the foundations for the dam.,
Add material until your dam is the height you want it to be.,
Reinforce the downstream side of your dam with heavy canvas, nets, timber, girders, etc (depending on the size of the river) - this helps to prevent it shifting and/or collapsing under the weight of water it's gonna have to take.

,
If you've got concrete, concrete all over the dam and reinforcements, and let it dry.,
Carefully close off the first diversion channel.",How to Dam a River," Typically you can do this by digging/blasting out a series of trenches leading from well-upstream of the dam site to somewhere downstream. If you do this correctly, the place where you want to put the dam will no longer be in the path of the river. Ensure that the diversion channels can be closed after the dam is completed - you can do this by making sure that there is a closable gate between the beginning of each channel and the river itself.


How much water are you thinking of holding back behind your dam? You need to make sure there is enough space to hold it all - dig/blast out a reservoir in the newly-dry area between the dam site and the place where the river enters the diversion channels.;
, If you're just using rocks, you need to put the biggest ones down first, and you need to put them downstream of the rest of the material, i.e. you build the dam FROM downstream TO upstream.

, A wedge-like cross-section is best, with the thin end of the wedge pointing downstream. You can only do concave-curved downstream-surfaces with huge, government-scale dams, huge crews and millions of dollars.

,, If you haven't got concrete, you'd better have done step four really well, and you'd better cover the dam with a thick layer of earth and pack it down.

, Wait until the water level behind the dam has stabilized before closing off the second. Repeat the opening/waiting for the rest of the diversion channels.

Sort through your priorities before you go apartment shopping.,
Make a list of apartment complexes that you're interested in.,
Call each apartment complex with a set of questions.,
Show up for your appointment on time.,
Observe the exterior of the complex.,
Be vigilant when you enter the apartment.,
Visit at night if you can.,
Ask if there are any specials or promotions.

,
Inquire about deposits and fees.

,
Ask for an application.

",How to Choose an Apartment Complex," Consider the following factors, and determine which are the most important to you:


Low up-front costs
Good neighborhood
Flexibility to relocate
Low monthly rent
Good management and maintenance
Amenities (swimming pool, sauna, laundry hook-ups or utilities)
Square footage
Appearance, interior and exterior
Proximity to work, public transportation, shopping, highways, etc.;
, Record the name of the complex, the full address, and the phone number. Leave room for notes. You can do this on paper or in a spreadsheet program. It's important to start off organized because if you're exploring several complexes at once, it's easy to get confused (""Which one had the double sinks in the bathroom? Which one was right by the highway? Did I visit this one already?""). There are many ways to find apartment complexes you might like to live in:


Drive around the area you're interested in. If driving slowly, put on your hazard lights, as speeding along and then making a sudden turn into a complex that just came into sight can be dangerous. Stop and look for a phone number, or if it's convenient, go directly to the rental or leasing office if they're open.
Pick up a local rental guide.
Visit websites which advertise apartment complexes and listings.

, These questions should cross out several of the complexes on your list. In the notes section of your paper or spreadsheet, write the date that you called. If the apartment is not what you're looking for, jot down why (e.g. ""no pets"" or ""no apartments available"").


Give the person the information they need: When you want to move (e.g. ""between March 1st and 15th""), what you're looking for (how many bedrooms?), and your price range (e.g. less than $800). If you have a pet, include this information early on.
If they have anything available that meets your needs, ask if you can make an appointment to visit and see the apartments they have available. Sometimes, the unit that meets your needs will not be available for showing until close to your move-in date. If this is inconvenient, ask if they can show you an apartment like it, and request a floor plan of the unit in question. You can also ask to see the outside of the unit, which will give you an idea of the kind of view you'll have and what your neighbors might be like.
Try to schedule apartments that are in the same area at around the same time. If you're not careful when planning this, you might end up going back and forth from one end of town to the other between appointments.

, Get driving directions in advance and give yourself enough time to find the complex (especially if you're in an unfamiliar area). Dress to impress, preferably in an outfit that screams ""I am responsible and trustworthy"". Be courteous and friendly. If the manager of the property thinks highly of you, they might go the extra mile to get you the unit you want or facilitate the application process.

,


Is the landscaping neat? Are the lawns and hedges trimmed? Or are there weeds growing out of the cracks in concrete?
Do the neighbors take good care of their apartments? People who don't are more likely to be inconsiderate. Some red flags:

junk on the balconies or front door
blankets on the windows instead of curtains
loud barking
non-handicapped vehicle in a handicapped spot


Where would you be parking? Does the lot look crowded? Will you have a hard time finding a space? Is the parking well-lit at night?

,


Does it smell funny?
Privacy?
Doors work?

, If the community is gated, you can still see how well-lit and crowded the parking lot is, and whether people are throwing parties or being loud.

You and your co-workers can then mutually decide on a charity you should donate that money to.

, If you want to donate to a local charity, do your research. Spend some time visiting non-profits and charities in your area. Browse websites and talk to members of these organizations. Try to find a charity that matches your values.


If you want, you can simply get cash back for your cartridges and pass that cash back to your chosen charity. However, you can also volunteer to set up an online program through one of the above organizations. This can streamline the donation process, and may help raise more money overall.

, Keep an eye out on recycling drives run by local schools and non-profits. As more and more people are realizing toner and ink cartridges can be recycled for money, many fundraising drives take ink and toner cartridges as donations. You may see donation boxes asking for recyclables, including cartridges, at local schools, churches, and community centers. This can be a quick and efficient way to dispose of cartridges while helping a worthy cause.

Reuse your ink and toner cartridges.,
Use less ink and paper.,
Look into other recyclables you can donate.",How to Donate Empty Ink and Toner Cartridges to Charity3," If you're worried about producing too much waste, you can actually reuse most ink and toner cartridges. Stores like Walgreens and Costco will often refill cartridges for you. This cuts back on plastic waste, and may also save you some money., You can also work on using less ink and paper overall to reduce your carbon footprint. Try to fill out forms electronically when possible. Avoid printing out things like plane and bus tickets, instead relying on a digital bar code you can pull up on your smart phone. If you print things out to read them later, try to transition into reading from a screen.

, Ink and toner cartridges are not the only recyclables you can donate to charity. Anything that can be recycled, like cardboard, cans, and bottles, can usually be donated to charity. Be on the lookout for recycling drives in your area. Give your recyclables to organizations in need.

Try to grasp the cultural idiosyncrasies that make each place unique. Read about the ratio of younger people to older people, and try to see the trends in why people are moving to a particular place.


Perhaps your favorite band or a beloved author hails from a certain city. Maybe you've heard that a city has a notoriously active and outdoorsy populace.
Living around others who are in the same socioeconomic bracket can be more comfortable than living among people who make considerably more or less than yourself. Whether you will be renting or owning a home in your new area, try consulting with a real estate agent to get a better idea of the neighborhood.

, It is important to make an informed and practical decision, but you should also find a reason to be enthused about the place you're going to live. Create a mental image of what life would be like here, and then evaluate whether that life is something you want.

, Determine whether you want to live somewhere hot, cold, wet, dry – near the coast or in the mountains. Basic research on a city or region should give you a good idea of the weather patterns. Consider the effects that a different climate (say, a very rainy place, or somewhere that freezes over in the winter) will have upon your lifestyle and your goals. Consider the temperature, the average precipitation, the air pollution, and the seasonal flux.


Some people suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which is a cyclical depression pattern related to the changing of the seasons. People often find themselves most down in the winter or the rainy season, when the skies are cold and overcast.If you are unsure of the climate in a particular area, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)has excellent data on everything from temperature to air pollution.

, This can also help swing your decision, although it may not be the most weighty concern. Some areas face a high risk of hurricanes and tornadoes, while other areas get a lot of earthquakes. Some areas are prone to drought, and others to mighty storms. Inform yourself of the danger so that you can make a conscious choice."

Your money will go much further in some regions than it will in others. On the other hand, the jobs that you'll find in a more expensive area will also typically pay you more. This is the dilemma: the places with the most opportunity are often the most expensive to live, and the most affordable places are often less conducive to building a career.Do not let money be the only deciding factor. Yes, you should move to a place where you'll be able to support yourself and you family. First and foremost, however, you should be excited about where you're going.

, Factor your current and future career into the equation. Consider searching for jobs in potential new cities just to get an idea for what's out there. Look for areas that feature a lot of jobs in a field that interests you.If you plan to keep your current job, then it may not be feasible to move somewhere that involves a lengthy commute.

, If you will be moving with children or expecting children, then research which areas have the best opportunities for schooling. Imagine how the culture and opportunities of a given area will impact the way that a child grows up. Pick a place that will provide a nurturing and stimulating environment for your children to call ""home.""


Think about the sort of support system that will be available. It can be much easier to raise children, both financially and logistically, if you are living near a network of family and close friends.
If you homeschool your child, make sure to look into homeschooling groups for a given area. Some regions are much more friendly to homeschoolers then others.

Obtain a suitable plastic barrel, large plastic trash can with a lid, or a wooden barrel (e.g., a wine barrel) that has not been stored dry for too many seasons since they can start to leak.,
Find a location for the barrel under or near one of your home's downspouts.,
Create a level, stable platform for your rain barrel by raking the dirt, adding gravel, or using some bricks or concrete blocks to make a low platform for it to sit on.,
If your barrel has a solid top, you'll need to make a hole of a suitable size for the downspout to pour into.,
To reduce the risk of breeding mosquitoes and to keep debris from the roof from entering the rain barrel, fasten a piece of window screen to the underside of the barrels top surface around the water inlet.

,
Drill a hole of the correct size based on the hose bib you're installing on the side of the barrel, as close to the bottom as possible unless you plan to run PVC piping inside the barrel to a location near the top.,
Attach a second hose bib to the side of the barrel near the top, to act as an ""overflow"".,
Attach a garden hose to the lower hose bib and open the valve to allow collected rainwater to flow to your plants!,
Consider using a drip irrigation system in conjunction with the rain barrels.",How to Build a Simple Rain Collection System," Good sources for plastic barrels include suppliers of dairy products like milk and ice cream, metal plating companies, and bulk food suppliers. Just be sure that nothing toxic or bad for plants and animals (including you!) was stored in the barrel. A wine barrel can be obtained through a winery. Barrels that allow less light through will eliminate the risk of algae growth and the establishment of other microorganisms.;
, You'll probably have to shorten the downspout by two or three feet to let the barrel slide under it, either by removing screws or rivets at a joint, or more likely by cutting off the last two or three feet of downspout with tin snips or a hacksaw. Flexible downspouts can be purchased from most home improvement box stores. They will direct the water from the downspout into the barrel. An alternative approach that has eye appeal is to use a rain chain - a large metal chain that water can run down. If you don't own the property, be sure to get permission before altering the downspouts!

, Keep in mind that a barrel full of water is very heavy, so be sure you allow for this in designing your platform.

, You can often do this using a hole-cutting attachment on a power drill, or by drilling a series of smaller holes close together and then cutting out the remaining material with a hacksaw blade or a scroll saw.

,, Attach the hose bib using screws driven into the plastic barrel. You'll probably need to apply some caulking, plumbers putty, or silicon sealant around the joint between the barrel and the hose bib to prevent leaks, depending on the type of hardware you're using and how snug it fits in the hole you drilled.

, Attach a short piece of garden hose to this overflow, and route it to a flowerbed, lawn, hole drilled in the side of a second rain barrel, or another nearby area that won't be damaged by some running water if your barrel gets too full. If you are chaining multiple barrels together, one of them should have a hose attached that can drain off the overflow.

, The lower bib can also be used to connect multiple rain barrels together for a larger water reservoir.

, Rain barrels don't achieve anything near the pressure of city water supplies so you will need to avoid the micro-sprinkler attachments and you will need to use button attachments that are intended to deliver four times the amount of city supplied water as you need.

Acquire an engine.,
Choose an AC generator head.,
Select a 12 volt DC alternator.",How to Build a Generator1," The required engine size is dependent on the amount of power that the generator will need to supply. A good rule of thumb for a useful, compact generator is to choose an engine in the range of 5 to 10 horsepower. Note that most engines rate their horsepower at a speed of 3,600 rotations per minute (RPM). These motors are about the size of lawn mower engines, and are typically available at lawn equipment stores, industrial supply shops or power equipment outlets.;
, This head will use an internal magnet to create electricity when the shaft mounted magnet is spun by the external engine. For most applications, output levels of 2,500 to 5,000 watts is suitable. In sizing the head, use the specification of the manufacturer to determine the engine size needed to drive that head. As a rough estimate, a generator can produce about 900 (749 watts per horsepower is the actual conversion) watts per input horsepower. Heads are available through industrial supply outlets and industrial equipment catalogs.

, This alternator will generate 12 volts DC when the shaft is driven by the external engine. The alternator chosen must have a built-in voltage regulator. A 500 watt alternator is typically sufficient, and would require about another horsepower from the chosen engine. Alternators are widely available at auto parts suppliers.

",How to Build a Small Pad With Landscape Timbers," Landscape timbers come in 8' lengths, so to make things easy, with less cutting, try a pad that's in dimensions of 8' or 12', such as 8' x 8', 8' x 12', or 12' x 12'. The above pad is 12' x 12'. Anything much larger and you will need 'deadmen' laid into the pad for lateral stability.;
, In a 12' x 12' pad, this wall will begin with one full timber and one half a timber laid in a line. Timbers can easily be cut with a handsaw. This bottom row can either be dug in and laid on grade, or propped up on solid rocks to keep moisture away. Landscape timbers are surface treated for outdoor use. Get the row level with a 4' to 6' level - pound it into position with a rubber mallet if necessary.

, For this drill a hole 6"" from each end of the timber, and for the 8' piece, one in the center. Drill a hole 1/16"" smaller than the diameter of your rod (1/2"" rod is ideal, but it's harder to cut with bolt cutters - 3/8"" rod will work also). This is so the rod will be snug in the timber. Cut your rod so that it will be driven at least 1' to 1 1/2' into the earth, plus the height of the timber (3""). Pound the rod down and through your timber until the top of the rod is flush with the top of the timber. The rod has no head on it, so it won't hold the timber down - but it will hold it laterally and keep the timber from moving side to side. This will keep pressure from fill from pushing the wall out.

, The retaining wall is designed like a giant 'U', with the edges of the 'U' keying in to the soil and holding the main wall upright. Take an 8' piece and start it above one corner of your bottom row, perpendicular to it, and run it until it terminates completely underground. Depending on your grade, 8' might be too long - a 4' piece might work better. Anchor the timber into the soil with rod, and where it rests above the corner of the bottom row, attach it with a landscape spike. Landscape spikes are heavy-duty nails - try to stay away from the edge of the timber and drive them slowly. A 2 lb sledge works well.

,, Attach the timbers to the timbers below with landscape spikes. Mark somewhere outside the wall where you drive spikes in, so as you work higher you don't end up trying to drive one spike into one below.

, Attach with landscape spikes.

, 6"" back from where it terminates, drill a hole and drive rod in to hold it in place. Where the timber is on top of another timber, use a landscape spike. Spikes are $1 a piece, so use them sparingly. No more than every 4' is necessary. Be careful not to split the wood.

, Make sure each edge row overlaps the last and keys into the soil. When using landscape timbers as retaining walls, 6 timbers high is about all you can go without needing further lateral stability such as 'deadmen'.

, Remove sod with a spading fork. Rake out each wheelbarrow-load of dirt flat, and then tamp:

, It's easy to start mounding dirt in the middle - check for this as you go.

, Several heavy rains will cause the dirt to settle. However it will remain sticky when it's wet, because of the clay content. If you're not putting down gravel or pavers above, use a few bags of sand or lime to counteract this.

, It can be anchored into the pad at the corners with rod. Drive the rod deep into the pad and attach this to the corners of your structure.

, Enough will form a cobblestone floor. With larger stones, such as river rock, you can sweep out a layer of cement into the cracks, and mist it with a hose until it hardens.

",How to Build a Log Lamp," When you make your cut, be sure to try to cut it as square as possible. Simply run the cut ends of the wood on a jointer or belt sander to level up completely and make the ends smooth.;
, Mark a line with a straight edge from the center of the exit hole on the bottom of the lamp to the side in which you wish for the lamp cord to exit with a pencil. Then route a groove about 1/4"" deep following the line you made.

, Sand a total of three times and work your way from 100 to 120 and a final 150. This will ensure a great finish.

, While the linseed oil is still all over the lamp, use steel wool to sand the linseed oil deeper into the wood. Repeat this step three times and then dry the excess linseed oil off the lamp., Your kit should have a 4"" piece of 3/8 all thread, socket, socket casing, cord, and harp holder.

, Leave a little over 1/4"" of the all thread out of the hole. Place the harp holder over the all thread and screw the bottom part of the socket casing on to the all thread and set the set screw that is located on the bottom of the casing.

, Once out of the top of the lamp, untwist the wire and connect each wire to the two screw found on the light socket.

Fabricate a mounting plate.,
Mount the pulleys.,
Run the belt or belts.,
Mount the gasoline tank to the mounting plate.

,
Reconnect the gasoline supply.",How to Build a Generator2," This mounting plate can be made of any sturdy material that can withstand the vibration of the gasoline engine. The 3 main power pieces (engine, generator head and alternator) must be mounted so that their shafts are parallel and the shaft attachment areas for drive pulleys are in the same plane. Mounting holes and mounting hole patterns must be derived from the manufacturer data for each of the 3 major power pieces.

, A pulley must be mounted to the engine shaft to belt drive the pulleys that will come already installed on the generator head and the alternator. This pulley size must be chosen so that when the engine is rotating at the nominal running speed given by the manufacturer, the belts will scale this up or down to the pulleys of the generator head and the alternator. Choose the scaling so that the generator head and the alternator are running at the rated speed indicated on the manufacturer data sheet. In most typical generators, this will result in an engine pulley of 5 to 10 inches (125 to 250 mm). Pulleys are available at industrial supply stores and through equipment supplier catalogs.

, The design of the generator may need different pulleys on the engine to apply proper shaft speed to the generator head and the alternator, or this may be workable with 1 engine pulley and 1 belt. Run the belt over the pulleys and make sure that they are taught. Slotting the mounting holes of the engine will provide good adjustment to achieve this. A V belt is preferable to a standard belt as it will have less tendency to slip. Belts may be acquired from the outlet that supplied the pulleys.

,, Fill the gasoline tank and place the fuel feed lines to the engine.

Regrade and relandscape the area.",How to Excavate a Trench," Before you begin any digging project, call a utility location service. This will locate underground gas, electric, water, and communications pipes and cables in the area, to protect you from injury or liability in the event they are damaged.



  These flags are placed by the utility spotter, indicating a buried telephone cable.


In the US, by law, you must call Digline before beginning any digging project. Call 811 to contact a local call center. The service is completely free to use.;
, Take your time in the planning phase to find a layout that meets your needs, avoids utility lines, and minimizes damage to valuable property. With careful planning, the materials you purchase should be sufficient to complete the trench, and you won't have to change your plan after you start digging.


Trees, shrubs and other plants may suffer injury or die if their roots are damaged in excavation. Driveways, sidewalks, and structures can collapse if they are undermined.
Small plants, even turf grasses, can be removed and stored for replanting with proper care.







, The trench's depth requirements (for example, the required depth of a utility line) is a factor in choosing excavation equipment and other materials.


Some plumbing systems are gravity operated, and require a slope so the waste or water will flow unaided to the discharge location. In this situation, you may find the trench will be deeper on one end than the other.

, Sandy soils, loose stony soils, and wet, mucky material will make excavating a straight, deep ditch difficult and dangerous. In these scenarios, you may have to plan additional measures to complete your project successfully:

Shoring: This process uses a support structure for your ditch sides so they do not cave in and injure anyone, or undo the digging you have done before the project is complete. For example, a small excavation could use sheets of plywood supported by posts. Large excavations could use steel trench boxes or sheet piling. Anything deeper than 3 feet (0.91 m) should be shored up. Never enter a trench deeper than your waist if it is not shored up.
De-watering: This removes the excess water from the soil to help stabilize it while working. This can be accomplished either with a well point system, or a sock pipe and mud-hog type diaphragm pump to remove the water as it seeps into the excavation.
Benching the excavation: If you are digging in loose soil, a deep vertical trench wall is at risk of collapse. Benching involves digging the trench in steps or tiers instead, so the banks do not have to support more material than they are capable of. These benches are usually at intervals 2.5–3 feet (0.76–0.91 m) deep and twice as wide. They do take quite a bit of sidewall digging, which can require extensive area to complete. Keep in mind that it can still collapse the deeper the trench goes.

, Shovels, pickaxes, and other hand tools will suffice for minor excavations, but renting a mini excavator can save a lot of work on large jobs. Backhoes and even trackhoes may be needed if the project requires a very deep and/or long trench.


Unless you are already experienced with these types of equipment, it may be cheaper and safer in the long run to hire a professional excavator.

, Excavate 10–20 centimeter (3.9–7.9 in) of soil, depending on the depth of the topsoil layer. Store the topsoil away from other spoil material to avoid contamination. Ensure that the topsoil heap does not exceed 1–1.5 meter (3.3–4.9 ft) in height to avoid compaction. For the same reason, either demarcate the topsoil heap or locate it away from frequent foot and vehicle traffic.

If the topsoil is going to be stored for prolonged periods of time, over-seed with non-invasive grass species to reduce erosion, or cover it with a heavy tarp or plastic sheet.
You may be charged fines if heavy soil or muddy water runs off your work site. Installing erosion control wattles or rolls can contain the water and prevent fines. These can be purchased at landscape and\or construction supply outlets.

, Line your workers or equipment up with the ditch line, and start to dig. Be careful to observe soil conditions so that the trench embankments do not yield, allowing them to cave in.

, If the trench needs to be ""benched"" (excavated in steps), dig to the depth of the first bench. Otherwise, dig the first section to the full depth of the trench.


If you need to bench, make subsequent entrenchments to the depth of each bench prior to digging deeper, so the banks of each bench will remain stable throughout the process.

, Throw the spoil (the removed soil) far enough that it will not encumber you while working in and around the trench. This will also prevent the removed material from creating an overburdening of the trench's banks or sides, which would increase the risk of collapse.

, Check the depth with a laser level or builder's level where the grade is critical to ensure the finished trench will not require adjustments.


It is very difficult to 'walk' a piece of equipment back down an excavated trench. The heavy weight of the tools or machinery can increase the risk of collapsing trench walls. If you are operating equipment on your own, always keep it on undisturbed solid ground for as much of the process as possible.

, Once the entire trench has been excavated, recheck the depth throughout its length. Check the embankments for stability, and do any smoothing or finished grading of the trench bottom necessary to install the material the trench was dug for., For example, you may be removing an obsolete utility line, installing a new one, or installing a drainage system or sanitary sewer.

, If you have access to one, a gasoline operated plate tamp will enable you to pack the soil as it is replaced in the trench. For deep trenches, backfilling in lifts (layers) of about 8–10 inches (200–250 mm) and compacting the material as it is placed will reduce the amount of settling that will occur after the project is completed., Roll out a heavy geotextile barrier over the soil first to prevent topsoil from mixing with gravel in the trench. Then replace the topsoil in the trench. This will ensure fertile soil and easy re-vegetation without having to resort to costly fertilizers., Attend to surface conditions after connecting any utilities you have installed."

Attach the reinforcements.,
Drill the holes for the rope.",How to Make a Rope Swing1," To create a sturdy rope swing you’ll need a 36"" 2x8 wooden board. Make sure the wood you use is strong like Oak or Walnut. You’ll also need two seat reinforcements that should be the same type of wood and 4” of 2x8. For a long lasting swing, pressure treat the wood before constructing.You’ll also need the following tools:


Saw
Drill
Nails
Hammer
Measuring tape
Pencil or marker
Lighter or matches
Two climbing carabiners;
, Measure 36 inches of 2x8 and mark it. Saw the main seat out of the 2x8 and then measure out two 4” blocks. Saw off your reinforcement blocks. You can also go to the hardware store with your measurements and they’ll cut the dimensions quickly., Align the 4” blocks at the two ends of the main seat so that the corners are smooth. Position the wood so the two reinforcements are underneath the seat. Use your hammer to apply two nails on each side.If you want to be more secure, you can add more nails to the reinforcements.

, Use a drill to create two ¾” holes on each side. Drill through both the seat and the reinforcements. The holes should be evenly spaced on each side. Use a marker and measuring tape to ensure you create even holes."

Acquire a rope.,
Keep the rope from unraveling.,
Attach a carabiner.",How to Make a Rope Swing2," To create a lasting rope swing, you'll need to use a ⅝” braided hollow core polypropylene rope. This is a strong and durable rope used for climbing. You can find this style of rope at an outdoors store if you didn’t see it at the hardware store. The length of the rope depends on the height of the tree limb. For a twenty foot branch, you’ll need 80 feet (24.4 m) of rope.


Make sure you buy braided rope!, Cut out two five foot strands of rope and heat each end with a lighter until they begin to melt. Stop heating once they begin to melt. Thread one end through the top and make an overhand knot underneath the seat. Repeat this with the opposite end of the rope into the open hole on that side.Do this to both sides of your seat. The result will be two hoops secured onto the seat.

, Make sure you use a climbing carabiner and attach one to each side of the seat. This will attach the seat to the ropes that are secured to the tree."

Complete the rope swing.",How to Make a Rope Swing3," Scout your property for a good sized tree and make sure it is sturdy. Look for thick tree branches that extend at least 15 feet from the ground. Make sure the tree is in good health and can take the strain of a rope swing.


You don’t have to use a ladder to tie the knots., Once you’ve found a good branch, you need to measure the height from where the swing will hang. You need to leave three feet of slack for knots. Once you’ve measured how long each rope should be, cut two identical strands of rope., This is a common knot for creating a rope swing. Create two small coils close to each other and then layer them on top of each other. Thread the closest edge of the rope through the two coils. Then swing that edge around the rope above the two coils and thread it back through the coils.


Open up the hole underneath the coils and secure the knot that the coils have created.You’ll need to make this knot for each strand of rope.

, Toss the knotted edge over the branch you’ve selected. Pass the other end of the string through the hole and tighten it until the knot is in place on the branch. Repeat this process to the other rope.


Adjust your rope into the right position before tightening.

, Once the two ropes are in the proper place, tie an additional double-bowline knot onto the dangling rope. Once you’ve secured the two holes, attach the two carabiners to the ropes end. You should now have a balanced and sturdy rope swing."

Thread each end of your 10-foot ropes through the holes.,
Secure the ropes.,
Attach the slings to the long main ropes using two quick links.,
Level the seat and secure the stopper knots.",How to Make a Swing1," There are many aspects to consider when making a swing that is both safe and long-lasting. If your yard doesn't have a tree with a branch that meets these standards, consider a different project.


Oak trees are ideal, but any type of sturdy hardwood tree may be used. Evergreens and fruit trees should be avoided.
Pick a healthy branch that is at least eight inches in diameter. Carefully inspect for any signs of disease or splitting. A sickly branch is more likely to break off and fall, potentially causing serious injury to anyone below.
The placement of your swing should be at least three to five feet out from the tree's trunk. Press down on the branch at the point where you intend to hang your swing. If the branch bounces, choose a sturdier one.
Do not pick a branch that is too high off the ground. Twenty feet should be the maximum,but if you are making a swing for a young child, consider a lower branch. Remember that the higher the swing's attachment point, the greater the height your child may fall from.;
, You will need wood, rope, twine, three-inch deck screws, wood glue, fine grit sandpaper, two stainless steel quick link carabiners, and the right tools for the job.


For tools, you will need a saw, a leveler, measuring tape, a sanding block, and a cordless drill.
Buy enough 1.5-inch thick pressure treated wood for the job. You will need enough for three 7.25-inch wide pieces: one measuring 36 inches in length and two that are each 4 inches long. A two-by-eight board that is four feet long will be the easiest to work with. (If you are new to woodworking, keep in mind that the actual width and thickness of a two-by-eight are 7.25 inches and 1.5 inches respectively.)You will need a rope that is twice your planned swing's height (from the branch to the seat) plus an additional 12 feet. Use twisted polypropylene rope at least 3/8 inches in diameter. Keep in mind that nylon rope is typically too slippery for a good swing and a natural-fiber rope will eventually rot. Cut the rope into four pieces: two 10-foot lengths and two that are one foot longer than your swing's height., Throw one end of each rope up over the branch. Position the two ropes so that they are slightly over three feet apart. Tie a running bowline slip knot to one end of each rope. Next, thread the free end of each rope through its corresponding knot. Tug each free end to tighten the knot onto the branch.


This type of knot is very secure but will also expand with the growing tree.
If needed, you can attach one end of each rope to a rock with some twine before attempting to throw it. This extra step will make getting the ends up over the branches much easier., Remember that the base of your swing will be made up of three rectangles that will all be 7.25 inches wide. Mark two rectangles that are 4 inches for the supports and a third that is 36 inches for the main seat. Double-check your measurements before you begin sawing., To avoid the potential problem of the swing's seat cutting into the rider's thigh, sand down the front and rear top edges of your main seat piece. These will be two of the long edges on the same face of the board.You may also choose to sand down the other edges of the seat, but this is not necessary.

, Arrange the two supports each on opposite ends of the main board. If you only sanded down the top edges, make sure the support pieces are on side opposite from where you sanded. First, secure the pieces in place with wood glue. Next, reinforce the attachment using five deck screws for each support piece. Pattern the screws so that one is near each corner with the fifth directly in the center., Place two holes on each end through both the seat and its supports. Try to make each hole the same distance from the supports' edges and the center screw. The two holes on each side should create a line parallel to the seat's short side and perpendicular to its long side. Make sure the holes are wide enough to thread your rope through but not much wider., Use one rope for the two holes on one end and the second rope on the other. The two ropes should not cross. Position the ropes so that their ends are on the same side as the support pieces.

, Tie four stopper knots, one at each end of the ropes underneath the swing seat. Do not tie the knots too tight in case you need to adjust them later. There should now be two slings, one attached to each end of the seat., Unscrew your carabiners and hook one onto each sling. Screw the locking sleeves back on tight. Next, tie the ends of each rope hanging down to the quick links using a secure knot, such as a buntline hitch., Place a leveler on the seat to check for unevenness. If your seat isn't level, adjust the stopper knots accordingly. For example, if the seat is dipping forward and to the left, pull a little more rope through the bottom and move the knot up. Once the seat is level, tighten your knots. Your swing is now ready for use.

",How to Make a Swing2," There are two main types of tire swings: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal tire swings have three different attachment points to hold the tire level. In contrast, vertical tire swings hang from a single attachment. Both ways of making a tire swing are relatively similar, but there will be a few minor differences. In general, vertical tire swings are simpler and require less time to make.

, A branch for a tire swing has most of the same requirements as one for a rope swing. You'll need to find a sturdy hardwood tree, such as an oak, with a suitably-sized healthy branch.


The major difference is that more clearance away from the trunk is required for tire swings compared to rope swings, as tire swings are designed for more sideways movement. Allow at bare minimum 4 feet of space between the attachment point and the tree trunk. Even more space may be required if the branch you pick is higher than 10 feet., The main component of all tire swings is a tire. You can find cheap or even free tires from anywhere that recycles them, such as at a tire dealership. A tire with worn-down treads isn't suitable for a car, but it will make a great swing.


You will need a cordless drill for both types of swing.
For a horizontal tire swing, you will need four equal lengths of steel chain, four stainless steel quick links, one locking swivel hook, and three steel U-bolts.The chains should be at least 3/8 of an inch in diameter and between 3 and 5 feet long.For a vertical tire swing, the only other necessary item is a strong rope.

, Because you're most likely using a recycled tire, it will probably be covered in grime. Even a new tire has the potential to stain clothing and skin. Use a high pressure hose on your tire before making it into a swing. If you don't own a high pressure hose, consider making a trip to a car wash and using one there., When it rains, you will want the water to drain out of your swing to keep from making a mess. Position these holes at what will be the part of your swing closest to the ground.


For a horizontal swing, drill the holes into the center of one sidewall.For a vertical swing, drill one or two holes into one end of the wheel's tread.

, Before setting up your tire any further, go ahead and make sure it has a secure place to hang.


For a horizontal swing, simply hook one length of chain around the branch. Then, fasten it into a loop with a quick link. Finally, hang the swivel hook from the quick link with the hook portion facing down.For a vertical swing, Throw your rope over the tree limb. Tie a slip knot, such as a running bowline, onto one end of the rope and then thread the free end through the knot. Pull the free end so that the knot reaches the branch, attaching the rope to the tree., Once you've completed this step, your swing should be ready to use.


For a horizontal swing, begin by drilling three sets of two holes on the shoulder of the tire opposite of your drainage holes. Separate the three sets an equal distance apart so that the tire is split into even thirds. Space the pairs so that your three U-bolts can fit into them. Hook each U-bolt onto the last link of each of the three remaining chains. Place the bottom of the U-bolts through the holes you just made and fix them in place using the plates and nuts they came with.Finally, hook the last link of the chains' free ends onto the locking swivel hook. Your swing should be finished once the hook is locked into place.For a vertical swing, simply tie the free ends of your rope to the tire at the end opposite of its drainage holes. Use a square knot and double-check that the rope is secure.,"

Get a roll of heavy-duty plastic sheeting.,
Unroll the plastic sheet on a grassy lawn.,

Roll the edge of the plastic around the first pool noodle.,
Secure the noodle with landscape anchor pins.,
Continue rolling and securing the pool noodles.,
Run liquid soap down the middle of the slide.,
Spray water onto the slide.",How to Make a Long Slip and Slide2," Buy a roll of thick, plastic sheeting that is between 6 and 12 feet (1.83 and 3.66 meters) wide and 100 feet (30.48 meters) long. You can cut the plastic down shorter, if you want to, but don't make it narrower.


Get thick plastic, around 6-mil. Don't skimp and get the cheap stuff—it will' tear.


, It would be better if you unroll the plastic sheeting on a hill, even if it is a short one. The slight incline will help give you more speed on the way down.


Smooth out any wrinkles or ripples with your hands.

, They need to be right on top of the plastic, a few inches/centimeters away from the edge. Keep the pool noodles 6 to 10 feet (1.83 to 3.05 meters) apart.You will need noodles along both of the long edges.


Pool noodles are long, colorful tubes made from foam. You can find them in many stores during the summer.

, Start with a pool noodle at the beginning of your slide. Roll the plastic around the noodle twice. Hold the pool noodle steady or have someone do it for you.If you don't have landscape anchor pins, place the pool noodle 1 foot (30.48centimeters) from the edge of the plastic sheeting., Hold the noodle in place, then drive a landscape anchor pin through it. You will need a pin at both ends of the noodle. Be sure to drive the pin straight down through the plastic and the noodle, right into the lawn.For extra security, add one in the middle as well.


If you don't have landscape pins, fold the edge of the plastic over the pool noodle, and secure it with duct tape or packaging tape., The noodles will help create a barrier. Not only will they prevent you from going outside the edges of the slide, but they will help keep the water in the slide as well. If you want to, you can add a pool noodle at the end of the slide as well to act as a buffer.

, You can use dish soap, if you like, but baby soap would be even better. Run the soap down the middle of the slide. This will help lubricate the plastic and make it even more slippery., Grab a hose and turn the water on. Spray the water onto the slide. You need just enough water to make it wet. Do not fill the slide like a mini pool.

Walk over the area and pat it down with your hands. This is important. Any sharp shells or rocks can not only cut the plastic but also you.

, Buy a roll of plastic that is 10 to 12 feet (3.05 to 3.66 meters) wide and 100 feet long (30.48 meters). Make sure that you use thick, heavy-duty plastic, about 6-mil. Don't use the thin kind just because it is cheap; it will rip and tear., You can do this by burying them in sand, about 1 to 2 feet (30.48 to 60.96 centimeters) on each side. You can also drive landscaping anchor pins into the edges instead. Use a hammer to drive the pins into the sand so that they don't stick out. Keep them 5 to 10 feet (1.52 to 3.05 meters) apart., This will lubricate the plastic and make it even easier to glide along it. Use environmentally-friendly soap, if you can, such as unscented castile soap., If you have access to a hose with fresh water, use that if possible. If you don't, grab some buckets and start gathering water from the sea. Pour enough water onto the plastic to make it wet."

Site the swales.,
Attach the line to the stakes at the same distance up from the bottom.,
Pound in stakes once you've found the contour for your swale.,
Dig a level trench.,
Get the bottom of the trench flat and level.,
Begin filling the swale.,
Add bulk material, like rotten wood.,
Add a final cover material, like straw.,
Dig more swales the same way, until you've covered the necessary area.",How to Dig Swales," Put them slightly uphill from areas you want to hydrate, and/or areas you want to stop erosion in. Take two stakes and run line between them for the length of the proposed swale. The above swales are each 30' long. A swale must be dug 'on contour', and have a level bottom. This is so the water captured by the swale pools evenly and percolates deep into the soil.;
, That way when the stakes are stretched out, you can read whether they're at the same elevation by using a line level placed at the center of the string. Set the line rather high to clear weeds and other obstructions. Keep moving one stake until the line level on the string reads level. This may be diagonally across your slope - this is fine, just stagger your swales so that runoff can't get by. You may want to construct a simple A-frame, a leveling device that will show you the contour as well.

, A good swale width is around 16""-18"" - wide enough for you to get in and dig.

, The trench can be as deep as you need - 1' is about average, less if you don't plan on filling it in with anything. Loosen the dirt with a pick. Shovel it out with a half-length snub-nosed transfer shovel. All the loose dirt goes on the downhill side of the swale, heaped up into what is called a ""berm."" It acts as a retaining wall and holds water back that fills the swale. It also makes a great planting bed, as the dirt is tilled and mounded up with little competition nearby, and copious water. Planting the berm will stabilize the new soil.

, Lay a long straight board along the bottom, with the narrow or ""factory"" edge up - place a 4' to 6' level on it. Get the board level, then look beneath it to gauge where in your trench you need to go a little deeper. Rather than dig with a pick here, it's much better to scrape the bottom with a square-edged shovel to get it nice and flat. Once this area is done, move the board further down the trench and continue, until the entire bottom of the trench is straight across and level. Don't worry about absolute perfection here - just do the best you can. Keep in mind, rotting swale material, and any movement of berm dirt will lump up the bottom and throw it off - so perfection won't last anyway. You can also crack the bottom of the swale with a spading fork to aid in percolation:

, Gravel works but is costly, and you have to haul it up to the swale. If you're planting the berms with something acid-loving, like blueberry, try to simulate the conditions it likes in the wild. Start with a layer of leaves.

, Make sure it's spongy so it will continue to decay. You have the option of not filling the swale at all, but that will leave a rather unsightly hazardous ditch susceptible to erosion. The wood will rot and provide nutrients for whatever you plant the berm with, and stabilize the trench. If you don't have rotten boards, gather rotten wood from the forest.

, It will help hold the moisture in the wood. If possible, just run some water over the wood, or pour a few buckets in, before you cover with straw.

, Make sure each swale butts up to the other, or overlaps, so runoff can't get through and start a gully. Plant the berms and you're done!

For either house, there are a few steps that you need to follow


Plan!",How to Make a Mini House in Your Backyard1," A good plan should include how big your house will be, where it will be, what it will be made of, etc.
Get supplies. You need to get the material that you will use to make the house (boards of wood or bricks).
Read all instructions before beginning.

"
"
Dig a square hole in the perimeter of your house.,
Put a board in the hole, put boards in all parts of the hole except one place (this one place will be the door).,
Fill up holes, make sure that the boards don't wobble much by filling up the holes.

,
Screw the boards of wood that are your wall together.,
Seal up the screws.,
Put in a roof.,
Make a door (optional).,
Make windows (optional).",How to Make a Mini House in Your Backyard2," The hole should not be very wide, but should be a foot or 2 deep.;
, This will be the walls of your house.

,, Do this by putting a small piece of wood on 2 pieces of wall and screwing the ends of the little piece of wood to the pieces of wall. Do this for all parts of the wall.

, You need to cover the pointy ends of the screws.

, You probably don't want to get rained on, so you will have to add a roof to your house. For this part, you get a long board of wood, one so long that it can go from one end of your house to the other. Put this board on top of the wall, one end on top of North Wall, the other end on top of the South Wall. (it doesn't have to be North and South, just as long as you use opposite directions. Then, screw the roof board to the wall that is under it. Then continue putting on roof boards.

, If you want a door, you can put a board on the hole if you want a simple door, but for a more complex door, you should attach hinges to a wall near the door, and attach a board of wood to the other end of the hinge.

, To make windows, cut out a square in a board before you put it in the hole.

"
"Place bricks where you planned for the perimeter of the house to be, leaving a little hole for the entrance

,Put some strong adhesive, like cement, on top of bricks when you start a new layer

,
Stack bricks on top of each other, putting the adhesive on all layers.

,
For a roof, it would be good to use a wood roof (see above)or a recycled roof (see below), But don't screw it, the adhesive should have it stick, or the duct tape, depending on which roof you pick.

,Leave a hole for the entrance

,
Make skylight (optional).",How to Make a Mini House in Your Backyard3,",,,,, If you want a skylight, you can cut a hole in the ceiling and put plastic over it.

"
"
Fill up many plastic bottles with sand, take this sand from where the perimeter of the house will be, this will make them heavier and they will have more inertia so that they don't move.

,Put bottles where you took the sand from

,Stack bottles on bottles

,
Tape the bottles together.,Tape some panes of plastic together and tape it to the top of the wall

",How to Make a Mini House in Your Backyard4,",,, Duct tape should keep them together.

Select a suitable site that is at least 30 meters (98.4 ft) from wells or bore holes.,

Dig a pit in the ground.,

Line the pit around with bricks.,

Cover the completed brick pit with a round cement slab the same diameter as the hole (1.3 metres wide).,

Seal the gap between the slab and the pit well.,

Build brick walls around the toilet base.,

Attach a chimney to the ventilation hole and bring it up through the roof of the toilet.,

Plaster the outer walls and chimney with adobe.
",How to Build a Blair Latrine," This will help to ensure that human waste doesn't end up in the water supply.
, Make the pit 1.3 meters (4.3 ft) wide and 3 meters (9.8 ft) deep., Mortar the bricks in place with cement. Use a trowel to neaten the mortar and remove excess mortar.,

The slab needs to have one hole for ventilation via a chimney and another hole to squat over. Cut these out before sealing the slab in place.

, Use cement mortar again. Sealing it vital because it will trap any flies and prevent them from congregating., This is for privacy., This ensures that dangerous odors and gases are ventilated upward and out into the air away from ground level.

Place fly screen material over the top of the chimney.

Attach the swing to a sturdy branch or rafter.",How to Make a Garden Swing," You will need five 21-inch (53.34-centimeter) long boards for the support joists. You will also need two 72-inch (182.88-centimeter) long boards for the front and back aprons. Lastly, you will need five 18⅛-inch (46.038-centimeter) long boards for the back supports Each board needs to be 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide and 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) thick., They need to be 15⅝ inches (39.69-centimeters) apart. Make sure that the first and last support joists are flush with the edges of the front apron. Drill 1½-inch (3.81-centimeter) pocket holes first, then insert 2½-inch (6.35-centimeter) pocket hole screws. You will need two pocket holes on each end of each board.Both the jousts and the apron should be standing up on their sides.

, When you are done, you should have a rectangle with three vertical bars running through it. Use 2½-inch (6.35-centimeter) screws and wood glue. Drill the holes first, then coat both pieces of wood with wood glue. Clamp the boards together, then insert the screws.

, Attach them to the back apron. They need to be 13⅝ inches (34.61 centimeters) apart. Use 2½-inch (6.35-centimeter) screws and wood glue.

, You will need two 11¼-inch (28.58-centimeter) long boards for the arm fronts. You will also need two 25½-inch (64.77-centimeter) long boards for the arm rests. Each board needs to be 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide and 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) thick., Attach each arm front to the each end of the front apron. Make sure that the bottom edge of each arm front is aligned with the bottom edge of the apron. Once again, use 2½-inch (6.35-centimeter) screws and wood glue.

, Make sure that the back end of the arm rest is level with the front end. Use a level to make sure that the arm rests are flat. Secure them with 2½-inch (6.35-centimeter) screws and wood glue.

, You will need six boards that at 72 inches (182.88 centimeters) long. Each board needs to be 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) wide and 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick., Position the slats above and below the arm rests. The top of the bottom slat should be flush with the bottom of the arm rest. Use 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) finish nails and wood glue.

, Attach the remaining four slats to the support joists. Leave ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) gaps between them. The first slat should be flush to the arm fronts. The back slat should be flush to the back supports. Use 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) finish nails and wood glue.

, Fill in any holes using wood filler. Let the filler dry, then sand it smooth with 120 grit sandpaper—be sure that you sand with the wood grain, not against it. Wipe away any dust using a damp cloth. If you will be painting your swing, it would be a good idea to apply some primer., If you wish to preserve the natural texture of the wood, apply a wood stain. If you wish to give it a solid color, paint it with a durable, outdoor quality paint. Apply the paint or stain according to the directions on the can, as each product will be a little different.


You may need more than one coat of paint. Be sure to let the previous coat dry before applying the next one.

, Choose a waterproof, outdoor quality varnish. Apply three coats to your swing. Allow each coat to dry before applying the next one. Whether you use a matte, satin, or glossy finish is entirely up to you.Sealing is important, even if the paint you use is labeled as waterproof.

, Drill the hole first, all the way through the joust. Place a washer over the hole, then a nut. Twist in the eye bolt, all the way through the board. Place another washer over the end of the bolt on the other side of the beam. Lastly, twist on the nut.Make sure that the looped part of the bolt is oriented vertically. When you look at the swing straight on from the front, it should be shaped like a ""O"".

, Cut two long pieces of study rope. Feed your first rope through both hooks on the left side. Feed your second rope through both hooks on the right side. Tie the ends together into a sturdy knot on each side.


The rope needs to have a 200-pound (90.72-kilo) weight capacity.

, Make sure that whatever you are hanging the swing from can support the weight. If you are hanging the swing from a set of rafters, use eye screws or heavy duty swing hangers.If the swing is still too tippy after you hang it, add one more set of eye bolts and ropes to the backrest.For more comfort, hang it at a slight backward angle, about five degrees."

Position the swing.,
Dig holes at each anchor point.,
Fix the anchors into each leg.,
Pour concrete into each hole.,
Place each anchor in the anchoring hole.,
Let the concrete dry.,
Cover the area.",How to Anchor a Swing Set1," Place the swing in its intended permanent location. Mark the placement of each leg using the blade of a shovel.


Nearly any type of soft ground will work for this method, and you can use this method with wooden and metal swing sets. During this process, you'll pour concrete into the ground and anchor the swing set legs to that, which will give the set enough durability regardless of the surrounding ground.;
, Temporarily remove the swing set, then dig holes at each marked anchor point. Each hole should be roughly 22 inches (55 cm) deep and 16 inches (40 cm) in diameter.


For maximum security, dig holes for all four swing set legs.
For heavy swing sets, you might be able to secure the set to the ground using only two anchors. If you choose to go this route, pick two corners that stand diagonally opposite of one another.

, Place the plate of one concrete anchor at the bottom side of each leg, then screw the anchors onto the bottom of each leg using the bolts that come with your anchoring kit.


Note that the bottom bolt of each anchor should be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the bottom of the leg.
Typically, you'll need to use two large bolts or screws to attach each anchoring plate to the corresponding leg. Slide the bolts into the screw holes of the plate, then use a drill to twist each one into the leg material.
When working with metal swing sets, you may need to pre-drill holes before attaching the anchoring plates. Mark the final placement of each screw and use a drill fitted with a 3/8-inch (9.5-mm) bit to drill holes in the appropriate places. Afterward, attach the anchor as usual.

, Mix a batch of standard concrete, then pour the concrete into each hole, filling the hole within 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the top.


When mixing the concrete, follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding the correct ratio of concrete mix to water. The ideal texture of the finished concrete should be consistent and very thick.
Continue to the next step while the poured concrete remains wet.

, Carefully position the swing set over each filled anchoring hole and press the bottom of each anchor plate into the concrete.


Make sure that the entire bottom half of the anchor rests below the concrete. This bottom portion should not stick out of the ground since it could present a safety hazard if it does.

, Wait 24 hours for the concrete to fully harden before using the swing set.


Note that the total amount of time may vary depending on the concrete formula and current weather conditions. Tap on the concrete to test its hardness before use.

, Pack the previously removed soil around the base of each leg and cover the ground area beneath the swing with soft material.


If using wood mulch or shredded bark mulch, cover the ground beneath the set with at least 9 inches (22.9 cm). When using uniform wood chips, fine sand, or fine gravel, cover the ground with at least 12 inches (30.5 cm).Check the swing set once more after covering the area beneath it. Firmly push on each leg of the set. If you anchored the set properly, the pressure should not be enough to cause any leg movement.

First, find two trees that would support a substantial amount of weight and are within 50-100m of each other.,
Then, purchase or find some rope that is 1–2 centimeter (0.4–0.8 in) thick, and is made of strong fabric or polypropylene.

,
Then, tie a bowline knot at the end of the rope and loop it around one of the trees.,
Put a pulley on the end of the knot and pull the pulley to the middle.

Position the swing.,
Twist each anchor into the ground.,
Attach the anchor to each leg.,
Cover the exposed screws.,
Lay ground covering over the area.",How to Anchor a Swing Set2," Choose the best location for your swing set and temporarily position the set in place. Use a small spike or similar object to mark the placement of each leg.


When anchoring a swing set to hard ground, like tough soils filled with clay or covered with dense grass, you may not need to use cement. A one-piece or two-piece twist-in anchor will usually suffice.

, Carefully shift the legs of the set to the sides of each marked hole. Twist one ground anchor directly into the soil at each marked position.


Ideally, you should use ground anchors at all four legs to maximize the security of the set. If you only have two anchors, however, you can still secure the set by positioning them at diagonal corners.
Remove the spike and twist each anchor into the same spot. Rotate the anchor into the ground, keeping it as vertical as possible throughout the entire process.
If you are unable to twist the anchor with your hands, slide a metal bar through the eye of the anchor and use it as a lever to help rotate the anchor down.

, Slide a screw or bolt into the eye of each anchor. Drill the screw directly into the side of the swing set leg.


The screws or bolts you'll need should come with the anchoring kit.
Position the swing set back in place so that the legs sit directly next to each anchor. Use a drill to carefully insert each screw through the eye of the anchor and into the bottom side of each leg.
If you have a metal swing set, you may need to drill the holes with a 3/8-inch (9.5-mm) bit before drilling the screws in place.

, Fit the head of each screw with an appropriately sized bolt cap.


In most instances, the anchoring kit will come with matching bolt caps.

, Cover the base of each leg with soil or mulch. Spread additional mulch over the rest of the area beneath the swing set.


Use 9 inches (22.9 cm) of wood mulch or shredded bark. Alternatively, use 12 inches (30.5 cm) of uniform wood chips, fine sand, or fine gravel.
Check the swing set by pushing on each leg. If the set does not budge when you apply pressure, you've anchored it successfully.

"
"
Position the swing.,
Bury the ground anchor attachment.,
Secure the leg attachment to each leg.,
Fit the upper anchor over the ground anchor.,
Cover the area.",How to Anchor a Swing Set3," Determine the desired placement of your swing set and temporarily set it in place. Mark the placement of each leg by chipping the ground with a trowel or similar tool.


You do not need to use any concrete for this method, but you do need to make sure that you insert the anchors into solid ground. Packed soils are better than loose soils or sand, and soils containing clay or covered in dense grass are even better.

, Place one ground anchor over each marked position. Slide a rebar through the matching holes at the top of each anchor, then rotate the bar and the anchor in a clockwise motion.Move the swing set away from each marked position before you begin. You'll need clean access to all four anchoring spots when burying them.
For this method, you must anchor all four legs to the ground. Do not anchor only two.
Each ground anchor should look have a drill at the bottom and an open ""cup"" at the top. Point the drill portion in the direction of the ground. As you rotate the rebar, apply enough downward pressure to spiral this drill into the ground, and continue until the entire drill portion is buried. Remove the rebar when done.

, Place one 4-by-4 leg attachment at the bottom of each swing set leg. Fix this attachment to the leg using two 3/8-inch (9.5-mm) bolts.


Note that this upper portion will look similar to an open cup with a tube at the bottom. The bottom of this ""cup"" should slip over the top of the previously-placed ground anchor ""cup.""
You may need to drill the holes with an appropriately sized drill bit before fitting the bolts into the legs, especially when working with metal sets.

, Line up each leg with each ground anchor, then push the leg attachments over the revealed ground anchors.


Match up the screw holes, when applicable. Drill another bolt through each overlapping pair of holes to secure each leg attachment to its corresponding ground anchor.

, Cover the exposed anchors with soil or mulch. For added safety, cover the ground beneath the set with additional mulch.


Apply roughly 9 inches (22.9 cm) of wood mulch or 12 inches (30.5 cm) of fine sand or fine gravel.
After covering the ground, push on each leg. If you anchored the set correctly, the legs should not budge when you apply pressure.

This will result in removing the old string. Repeat the process on the other side of the spool to remove all of the old lines.Wear gloves when working with your trimmer.

, Purchase a .080 inch (2.0 mm) diameter round monofilament line from a hardware store. Do not use a serrated or heavier line because it can overload the motor and cause overheating.You can also buy pre-threaded spools from Black and Decker's website or at some hardware stores.

, Feed the line through the hole and begin to wrap it around the spool. The more you overlap your spool, the more likely it is to get tangled when you start working with it. Instead, wrap the spool so that the line is wrapped next to itself, not over itself.Most Black and Decker models will have you wrap the string counter-clockwise.

, Allow for 6 inches (15.24 cm) of slack on the end of your line after you're done wrapping it around the spool. Cut the thread with gardening shears or sharp scissors and put the excess line through the eyelets on the spool to hold them in place., Repeat the steps to wind up and secure the other line on your spool. Again, follow the arrows when you are winding up the line.

, Make sure that the eyelets on the cap and the spool are also lined up. Line up the hole in the center of the spool with the center of the cap and gently press the spool back into the cap. Once you hear a click, turn the cap over and shake it to make sure that the spool is secure., Pull the excess line out of the eyelets on the spool and push them into the eyelets on the cap. Your spool is now ready to go back into your trimmer.

, Press down on the side tabs on your cap to fit it into the trimmer head. Lightly press on the cap until you hear a click. Your spool is now replaced."

Shade. Your kids will want to spend hours in the sandbox, so make sure it's someplace that is protected from the sun's harmful UV rays. This can be near the house or a shade tree (be careful you don't damage the roots when digging). It can also be a portable patio umbrella, which has the advantage of being able to be placed where needed for maximum shade.
Sight. Make sure your sandbox is easily within the line of sight so that the adults watching the children can keep an eye on them.
Drainage. After a summer shower, you'll want to make sure your sandbox can drain naturally, so build it at a higher elevation if possible, and definitely not in a low spot in your yard. Try to build it so that there will be a slight slope. This will help with drainage.;
, Determine how long you want each side to be and purchase lumber so that it is 3-1/2"" shorter than that, assuming you can stipulate how long you want your boards to be when you purchase them. If not, you can cut them to size yourself.









For this example, we'll assume a 6' square sandbox, so cut each board to 5'8-1/2"" in length. If you have a circular saw, you can do this yourself. If not, your lumberyard will be able to do this step for you.
4x4 lumber is actually only 3-1/2 x 3-1/2 square. To make this sandbox you will be joining the boards together, and this is why the individual boards need to be shorter by this amount.

, Mark the outside perimeter of the boards, remove them, and dig out inside that perimeter to a depth of six inches. Always make sure to call the Digline at 811 first to ensure that it is safe to dig in a particular area.







, Make it about 4"" wide and 1"" to 2"" deep. The bottom layer of boards will sit on this sand bed, and if the ground is not perfectly level, the sand bed will help you level the boards.








, Lay down the first layer of boards as in the shape of a square.








, Use a framing square to make sure each of the four corners are square, and tack them into place by screwing the scrap lumber across the corners.








, Once your first layer is tacked together and square on all 4 corners, level it with the rubber mallet, tapping each side into the sand, and checking the level frequently. Make sure it is level all around.








, Carefully remove the temporary corner tacks, and lay down the second layer of boards overlapping the first layer, as shown:








, Using a drill driver, attach the second layer to the first layer using 6"" self-tapping timber screws. Space them evenly, 3 on each side. Pre-drill a pilot hole at least half the diameter of the 6"" screw to help with installing screws to the base.








, Lay a sheet of landscaping fabric across the sandbox so that it overlaps the second layer, and work it all around the edges and bottom of the sandbox pit so that it completely covers everything. This will allow water to drain out, and keep weeds from finding a new home.








, Using the same overlapping method as the second layer, lay down the third layer of boards, and screw them together with the timber screws. Be sure to offset the screws from the ones below!








, Using heavy duty scissors or a utility knife, trim away the extra landscaping fabric.








, To determine how much sand you will need, use this formula: Multiply the length x width x depth (don't fill it all the way to the top), and then divide that number by 27. This will give you the amount of sand in cubic feet you'll need to fill your sandbox. Make sure you use play sand, as this has been cleaned and is much less dirty than building sand.








, You will want to have some kind of cover on your sandbox. The danger is that wild animals or even domestic ones love to poop in kids' sandboxes! Oh no! You can build a basic cover by getting two doors and attaching them with hinges to the outside of the wooden frame of the box, or you can follow the directions below to make two benches which slide over the box. This bench allows you to pull it only partially, creating seating at the side of the box for mommy or daddy, while junior plays in the sand.








, These posts should be made of 4x4 lumber. Their length will be determined by how high you made your sandbox. They will need to be at least 5"" higher (from the ground) than the box. There will be four posts used for each of the two benches.








, Get eight 1x4s to join the posts together (4 for each bench). The length of the boards are very dependent on the six of the box you built. Once the boards are cut to size, use 2 wood screws (at least 2"" in length) at each end and attach the board so that the top of the boards are flush with the end of the posts and the ends of the boards are flush with the sides of the posts.









In the example used above where the box is 6'x6', the short-end joining board would need to be ~38 3/4"".
The formula for figuring out the length of the short end joining boards is 1/2 the length of your box + ~2.75"".

, Get six 1x4s (3 for each bench). These will form the long sides of the bench. Again, the length will depend on how long the sides of your sandbox are. The short end joining boards will face the ""inside"" of the bench, while the long boards will need to be attached to the outside (again, flush with the sides of the posts, as well as the top and bottom). One side of each bench will only have a long board at the top and not at the bottom. Secure with 2 wood screws at each end.









In the example used above where the box is 6'x6', the long boards would need to be ~6'9"".
The formula for figuring out the length of the long side joining boards is your total sandbox side length + ~9"".

, Take two more 1x4s, the same length as your short end joining boards, and attach one to each bench, between the long side boards, using brackets. The support beam should have the wide side facing up, and be flush with the tops of the long side boards.









Make sure the brackets are small enough to fit underneath the support beam without going below the bottom edge of the long side boards.
Make your job easier later by marking the center line of the support beam on the front of the long side board. This will later be used to figure out where to nail the seat of the bench.

, Take 1x4s the same length as your long side boards and nail or screw them at the ends and the center to the top of the bench. You should use two screws/nails at each end and at the center. Lay the boards out first, starting from one side and progressing to the other. Place 1/4"" tile spacers between each board as you lay them out.









If you're following the example, you'll want 10 boards for each bench, plus an extra which will need to be split lengthwise down the middle with each bench taking a half. In other words, 21 boards total. Use a table saw or jigsaw to cut the board down the center.
The spacers between the boards allow air to circulate, helping to prevent mold, but do not allow naughty cats in!
If you're having trouble finding the center to nail down the boards, either measure for the center or use the guideline you put in when you made the brace beam.

, Open them only part way, so that the seat stops at the edge of the sandbox, in order to creating seating for kids and adults alike.








, You will also want to remove the cover with regularity to prevent mold growth.

A good cover will also keep your sand dry, which will prevent bacteria from growing in it.Many store-bought sandboxes come with covers. You can also purchase retrofit covers, or you can build one using plywood.
If the sand gets wet while your children are playing, be sure to let it dry out before you put the cover back on.;
, You may not be able to keep every last bug out of your sandbox, but you can help keep lots of them away by planting insect-repelling plants near your sandbox and adding some natural ingredients to your soil. Mint and basil are both natural, non-toxic insect repellents. Mint also repels rodents.
Be sure to cut off any flowers that grow on your plants, as they may attract bees.
Try spreading out some coffee grounds in your garden to repel slugs and snails, and cinnamon to repel ants.

, Pets can easily mistake a sandbox for a litter box, so it's best to keep them out of the sandbox at all times, even when you are supervising. A single accident in the sandbox can contaminate it with a variety of harmful bacteria and parasites.For example, it is common for cats to have toxoplasmosis in their feces.Toxoplasmosis can cause serious problems for anyone with a weak immune system, such as young children and pregnant women.Keeping your pets up-to-date on all vaccinations can help prevent them from spreading disease if they do get into the sandbox.

, Your sand can also become contaminated by human feces, so try to make sure your little ones always have clean diapers on when playing in the sandbox.If the sand is contaminated by human feces, then children who play in it may contract E. coli. E. coli is especially dangerous for young children.If your children aren't potty trained, never let them play in the sandbox without wearing diapers.

, To make sure your sandbox stays clean, use a rake or a clean litter box scoop to sift through the sand. This will help you find any foreign objects or clumping sand, so you can remove them immediately.The frequency with which you should clean the sandbox depends on how often it is used. If it gets heavy use, clean the sand at least once a week.

, Because there is no way to keep the sand in your sandbox 100% clean, it's a good idea to replace the sand every one to two years., While you can't wash the sand in your children's sandbox, you can wash the toys that they play with in the sandbox, which can reduce their exposure to contaminants. Wipe down all toys with disinfectants to help keep them germ-free.If a toy can't be easily cleaned, don't let your children play with it in the sandbox.

, No matter how well you clean your sandbox, there is still some risk of contamination. For this reason, it's best to always thoroughly wash your children's hands as soon as they are done playing in the sandbox. This will help keep any germs that they picked up out of their mouths.Do not allow your child to eat or drink anything in the sandbox.
Have your child wash his or her hands with soap and warm water for one to two minutes. Antibacterial soap is not necessary. Just use some regular soap.

, Children can get scratched if coarse material like gravel finds its way into the sandbox. To prevent this from happening, avoid placing gravel near the sandbox, where it might be tracked in.Raking out your sandbox regularly should help you find any gravel that may have gotten in.

, Many DIY sandboxes are built using wood, which can cause splinters. To avoid this, build your sandbox with the right type of wood, or avoid using wood altogether.Avoid railroad ties, which tend to splinter easily.
If you want to use wood to frame your sandbox, use landscaping timbers, which are perfect for outdoor use.
You can also use materials other than wood to build your sandbox, such as plastic lumber.
If your wooden sandbox starts to splinter, sand it down to prevent injury. If you do get a splinter, then you should try to remove it with tweezers right away. Splinters can invite infection and they are harder to get out the longer you leave them in. If you cannot remove the splinter easily and it is red and causing pain after a few days, then see a doctor to get it cut out.

, Wood that has been chemically treated for outdoor use is less susceptible to rot and insect damage, but some of the chemicals that are used to treat it are extremely toxic. Avoid any wood that has been treated with Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA), which contains the toxic chemicals chromium, copper, and arsenic.It's easy to recognize chemically treated wood, as it typically has a greenish hue to it, although this does not necessarily mean that it has been treated with CCA.
There are other chemicals that can be used to treat wood, which are safer than CCA. If you want to use pressure treated wood for your sandbox, opt for wood that has been treated with alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ) , borates, copper azole, cyproconazole, or propiconazole.

, Some sand that you can buy may contain minerals that are potentially harmful to children if inhaled. The biggest concern is tremolite, which is found in some play sand and may have adverse health effects similar to those of asbestos. To avoid this, only buy natural beach sand or river sand for your sandbox. Avoid any sand that contains crushed limestone, marble, or quartz, as these may also contain tremolite.
Regardless of the material, avoid any sand that is overly dusty.

If you rent your home, you must ask permission from your landlord if you wish to add anything onto the property.
Visit your city’s official website for a list of permits needed to build a patio on your property.
If you belong to a Homeowners Association, you may have to lobby for permission to build your patio. Contact your HOA to find out about the permissions they require for building in order to avoid fines.;
, Choosing what you’ll use your patio for is the first step in creating a dynamic and complementary outdoor space.


Maybe you want a space for parties, or maybe you simply want a private place to sit and people-watch.
Most patios are built for a mixture of personal and social uses, so you might want to design with a versatile patio in mind.

, Designing a patio that’s close to your kitchen is best if you plan to do any entertaining.Building a patio close to your kitchen is advisable for easy access to the house and to refreshments.
Quick kitchen access is also important if you are thinking of using the space for a lot of dining., Sizing and measuring the space is key to understanding what you have and what you can do with it.


Knowing the size of the space and how many people it will accommodate is essential. You can do a dimensioned drawing of the space, or simply mark the outlines of the space with chalk to visually plan how much space you have to work with.There is no set rule about how large or small your patio should be. One expert suggests that a patio with a fire pit surrounded by 4 or 5 chairs should at least be fourteen feet in diameter.If you have the space for it, a good rule of thumb is to build your patio proportionately to your house - make it as long as your house is tall, and as wide as your house’s length.
A simple way to get a general view of the space is to place chairs and tables around the lawn where you would like them to be on your patio., For the patio itself, you can use concrete, tile, brick, flagstone, tile, or pavers.These materials all come in many colors and can be customized to fit your needs. Visit your local hardware store for styles and pricing.
If you want tables and chairs for the space, be sure to choose a material that won’t cause the furniture to wobble. Go with concrete, tile, or any consistently flat material if you want to minimize furniture wobbling, and avoid gravel.

, Certain materials cost more than others, while some are cheaper but will take more time to install.


Concrete is likely the least expensive option, but can be very labor-intensive.Stone will probably be the most expensive option, especially if you choose natural stone., If you plan on pouring concrete or laying a more complex foundation, you might want to hire a professional.Some materials, like certain tiles, bricks, and Pavers can be installed without hiring a professional.
Most cities have professional, local patio builders. Do some research and call different businesses to get estimates and find out if this is the option for you.

, Inclement weather is inevitable, and your patio will likely come into contact with rain at some point.


There are several products on the market specifically made to waterproof your patio. The product you use will largely depend on the materials you are using to build.

A concrete patio can often be easily waterproofed by a beginner using one product.A stone patio may need to be sealed and then waterproofed, and may require more time and experience., Greenery can be aesthetically pleasing, and it can also offer shade and privacy.


If you are unsure about what plant life you want, you can simply lay the patio foundation first to see what you’re working with. You can always add greenery later if you choose to do so.Think about whether you have a green thumb or prefer plants that don’t need as much care. Being honest about your ability to manage plants will help you know which ones and how many to buy., Picking versatile, affordable, and durable furniture will help you create a dynamic and custom space.


Look for a great set of patio furniture that will be sustainable and affordable. Buy or borrow a stack of interior design magazines to get a feel for the different approaches to design that home accessories companies provide.
Most hardware stores have many different styles of patio furniture available. Visit various stores to see what types of furniture are available to help you decide what you do and don't want.

, Depending on how the sun hits your space, you may want an umbrella, gazebo, or awning.


Plants can also be a good source of shade. You can plant trees or shrubbery to help block the sun.

, Choosing the right furniture depends largely on how you plan to utilize your space.


If your patio will be used as a private outdoor area for you and your family, perhaps a few chairs, ottomans and side tables will do the trick. However, if you image lavish garden parties and elegant patio affairs, large-scale seating as well as table surfaces may be best.

Before you start this (or any other) digging project, call 811, A new, federally-mandated national ""Call Before You Dig"" number.,
Be careful to center the hole on the position for the pier.,
This is the completed hole.,
Fill the bottom with about one inch of gravel, sand or pea gravel.,
Compact the gravel at the bottom of the hole.,
Place the paver in the bottom of the hole and check for level by placing a post with square cut ends on the paver.,
Once the paver is level in all directions it is time to determine the pier length.,
Use a radial, or chop saw to cut the piers to length.,
Once the pier is cut to length recheck the height by laying the level on the ledger and the top of the pier.

Locate the pier by measuring from two known points.,
Once you have the exact location, mark the bottom of the pier with a felt pen on the paver.,
Carefully fill the hole with loose dirt until it is 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep in the entire hole.,
Carefully tamp the dirt with another pier or post while holding onto the pier to prevent it from moving.,
Fill the remaining dirt 4 inches (10.2 cm) at a time and compact.,
Use the extra dirt to create a sloped cap around the pier to discourage water from collecting near the pier.

,
Your efforts should result in a level aligned resting place for the beam.

",How to Install Deck Piers," 811 was created to help protect people from unintentionally hitting underground utility lines while working on digging projects.;
, Specification for distance between piers can be found in most books about deck construction. These holes are one foot square and one foot deep. The existing ground around the hole should be undisturbed as it provides the lateral support for the post. Poor positioning of the hole will result in a larger hole and less support.
<br

, Note the sides are vertical and the bottom is flat.

, This will allow you to create a flat level surface to place the paver on. It also absorbs some of the expansion and contraction that characterizes some soils.

, This is important to prevent the weight of the deck from pushing the piers down and creating sags in the deck.

, Then check the level in both directions on the posts top. You may also use a small 12"" level on the paver. If it is not level, add more gravel or sand and recompact.

, This deck is attached to a retaining wall and a ledger board is the basis for the level. Position the pier and strike a line on the pier level with the top of the ledger.

, This assures a square cut that allows the beam to rest more completely on the end of the pier. These piers are 4"" pressure treated peeler cores. You could also use pressure treated 4""x 4"" posts.
,, Use the same points for every pier. Don't measure from pier to pier. If one pier is off, you will multiply the error.

, This will allow you to relocate the pier if it is bumped or move accidentally.

, Hold the pier to prevent the dirt from moving it off it proper location.

, The dirt should compact to at least 3 inches (7.6 cm), and the pier should be stable enough to stand on its own.

, You should have more dirt that the remaining space in the hole because of pier, paver, and gravel.

, Tables are visually appealing and serve many uses. Small coffee or end tables can be placed next to your chairs to hold drinks, food, and other items while you sit, converse, or eat. While not in use, tables can also hold plants and holiday decorations.

, A colorful outdoor rug made from polypropylene can liven up your porch and is easy to clean.Even if your porch is only a few square feet, get a coarse doormat to wipe your shoes on and reduce the amount of dirt coming into your home.

, Even specially designed outdoor furniture can be damaged by adverse conditions like rain or snow. Apply a thick finish to wooden furniture and use a waterproof paint to coat iron and aluminum furniture.However, these finishing layers will not last forever. Check your furniture occasionally for cracks or peeling and cover these areas as needed.


Wooden furniture and cloth cushions are susceptible to sun bleaching if they are regularly exposed to sunlight."

Although not all plastics are damaged by chlorine bleach, if you are not certain, then choose a cleaner that does not contain chlorine bleach.,
If you choose to scrub the deck clean, choose a deck brush with natural or plastic bristles.,
You may choose to use a pressure washer to spray the deck clean.,
If you are cleaning to remove mold or mildew, there may be more to consider before you begin:

,
""Chlorine Bleach has been proven to kill bacteria, viruses and fungus but has not been proven effective in killing or removing molds on *porous surfaces such as composite decking and this fact is stated on the label directions of products like Clorox® Bleach.,
http://ths.gardenweb.com/forums/load/porch/msg0318115823454.html

,
Now that you are ready to begin, clear off the deck and assemble your cleaning supplies.,
Fill your bucket with the water and cleaning solution of your choice.

,
Wet the deck at one end by dipping the deck brush into the bucket, then sprinkling the water and cleaning solution onto the deck several times.

,
Scrub the dirty deck.,
Continue to scrub and wet the deck as needed, and move on to new dirty areas until the bucket is mostly empty.

,
Empty the remaining solution onto the deck and go fill the bucket with clean rinse water.,
Tip: If a water-hose is available, this could save many trips to just use the water-hose to rinse the deck.,
If you decided to use a pressure washer, then the high pressure water stream is doing the scrubbing and rinsing in one step.,
Once your deck is clean and dry, you may wish to seal any existing scratches.",How to Clean Plastic Decking," You may use white vinegar, apple-cider vinegar, ammonia, soap, or any of thousands of name brand variations of these.;
, Do not use a wire brush as that will thoroughly scratch your plastic decking. Scratches will trap dirt, look bad, and are difficult to clean. You will also need a bucket and a supply of clean water. Deck brushes are between 8"" and 12"" wide and utilize a pole so you can scrub while standing. You can also remove the pole and scrub while kneeling if you so desire.

, ""Pressure washing is also a good idea from time to time to remove built-up dirt and debris. When using a pressure washer, do not exceed 1800psi with a 20-degree nozzle."" http://epsplasticlumber.com/index.cfm/page/cleaning_care/cleaning--care.cfm

,, Most composites are porous materials because they are full of pores and permeable by water, air, etc. Some Composite manufacturers claim that the composite they manufacture is 'fully encapsulated' and therefor, their product is non-porous. If a composite absorbs moisture (humidity), however little it may be, the composite is porous. You can tell if your composite is porous if it becomes heavier when water is added. You can ask any composite manufacturer; 'what their composites moisture absorption rate or *Porosity?'""

,, Dry sweep any loose debris with your deck brush or any broom.

,,, Push the deck brush back and forth, exerting some downward pressure, but not so much as to compress the bristles of the brush. The tips of the bristles do most of the removal work. If you are pressing so hard that the sides of the bristles are sliding across the deck, then you are pushing down too hard and the bristles will not scrub as well.

,, Rinse the scrubbed area.

, If you happen to have more than one bucket, you may have several buckets of rinse water on stand-by. Work with one bucket of cleaning solution at a time so that your scrubbed section does not dry. Scrubbing loosens the dirt, then rinsing removes it, but rinsing works best when the dirt hasn't dried back in place.

, Follow the safety instructions that come with the machine since streams of high pressure water can be harmful and can cause personal injury. See an article specific to pressure washing techniques for some good tips.


Pressure washing may work better for getting dirt out of scratches in your plastic decking. For dirt that the deck-brush could not get, it may be necessary to use a tooth-brush. A micro-fiber cloth can also pull dirt out of fine scratches.

, You may look-up articles about sealing scratches in plastic using a heat gun, solvents, Krylon Fusion paint, etc. however that is beyond the scope of this article.

Grow plants.,
Embrace the holidays.,
Decorate your door.",How to Decorate a Porch2," Colorful flowers and succulents can be a perfect way to add color and life to your porch. Depending on how much light your porch receives, certain plants will grow better than others.Plants can be hung in baskets from your overhanging roof, or you can grow them in planter boxes attached to your railings and window sills.


If caring for real plants is too time consuming for you, consider replacing them with fake plants instead.

, There are enough holidays throughout the year that you can usually rotate directly from one to the next without appearing out of place. Major holidays like Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter are easy to find themed decorations for, but feel free to decorate for smaller holidays as well! Presidents Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Memorial Day, and the Fourth of July can all be fun to decorate for, even if only for one day.

, Doors are one of the most underutilized pieces of decorating and they have so much potential. Smaller decorations like seasonal wreaths and greeting signs can be hung on the door, but don’t stop there! Consider painting your door with a pattern or a simply a bright, inviting color. Your door should catch the eye, but not overly stand out; try to make it compliment your house as well as your porch furniture.

Install a lamp or chandelier.,
Hang rope or string lights.,
Use garden lights or torches.",How to Decorate a Porch3," Most porches will already have a light wired in, but this may not be enough to fully light your newly decorated porch. Hire a professional to come inspect your porch and install lighting as needed. Before doing this, swap out your old porch bulb for a newer brighter one to see if that provides enough light for your needs., Hanging lights can give your porch a magical, comfortable feeling and are also very easy to install. Find the nearest outlet to your porch and use an extension cord if your lights cannot reach it. Install equally spaced hooks around your porch on either the overhanging roof or side railings. Hang the lights up and plug them in whenever it gets dark.

, Small garden lights can be installed in either your planter boxes or around the edge of your porch. They will only provide a minor to moderate amount of light, but it is better than being in complete darkness. You can also install tiki torches around the edges of your porch for a fun and unique vibe.


The advantage to using torches is that you can use bug repellent fuel to discourage undesired bugs from bothering you and your guests."

Or do you want the deck to be detached? The second is the much easier option and will be easier to create a professional look. Attached decks can look very ""added on"" or ""after-thoughty"" if not done correctly and skillfully.;
, How high do you want your deck to be? If it's a high deck, especially such as one that is attached to a second story, you may find that there are special requirements demanded by your state. Often, railings of a particular height and style will be requested and special locks on doors may be needed if you have children. Lower decks require fewer supports and are often much easier to build.

, Is your house on a slope? Will your deck be affected? This can change the footing that you need and lead you to have to account for height, but if the slope is very steep, it may not be possible or safe to build a deck at all. If you are concerned about the slope on your property, contact a local building inspector to evaluate your property. Different areas are more or less geologically stable and only a local inspector will know if it's safe for you to put a deck on your property.

, The decks of yesteryear were flat as the boards that made them, but these days it's all about multi-level decks and decks with sunken fit pits or sitting spaces. If you want these things, you'll need a lot of space and some extra planning, but they're a great addition to any deck.

, Do you want your deck to have full sun exposure? Always be shady? Get an even mix? What time of day do you want it to get sun or shade? You'll have to strategically place your deck and any objects that create shade (like a roof, pergola, or trees) very carefully.


Place a pole in the middle of your deck area and watch how the sun hits it over the course of the day. You can use the shadows it casts to get a vague idea of where you might need to place a roof.
You should leave the proper planning, however, up to your contractor, since a lot of math can be required.

, Will your deck have stairs leading out the the rest of the property? Will it need to meet up with a door or window on the side of your house? Planning these elements is important, since you'll need to adjust your design for each different kind of access point.

, Some decks are simply a platform and do not have anything along the sides allowing you to move seamlessly from your deck to your yard. However, some decks have guard rails. These can be crucial in keeping you and your family safe and may even be required by law, depending on where you live and the height of your deck.

, Will you be putting a BBQ out on your deck? Mini kitchen? How about a hot tub? Lights along the rail posts? If you plan on needing a water, electrical, or gas supply on your deck, it's important to plan ahead on that, as these utilities will need to either be run from your house to the deck or may even need to be supplied from the street. This can be costly and may affect your design plans.

, You can get inspired by other deck projects by looking at all sorts of helpful sites online. Pinterest, Google Images, and design sites like DIY Network all have great inspirational images to give you ideas that can be discussed with your contractor.

, Cities and counties often have guidelines or requirements for how deck footings should be made. This is an excellent place to start when planning your deck.


Call your local city hall if you don't know how to contact the planning department.
It's important to call the planning department even if you don't need help planning the footing, because you will be required to have a permit and you'll want to know about any utility lines you may hit while digging the posts.

, The post holes will generally need to be placed below the frost line, so plan on having the tools to do this, as well as know what the frost line is for your area.

, Post spacing can vary, but a good happy medium is every 6' along the outside edges and roughly every 4' for the inside beams.

, The joists should be spaced either every 12"" or every 16"". Only use 24"" spacing if the wood you are using is very strong and the deck is not very high off the ground (< 3 feet).

, Standard joist sizes include 2x8, 2x10, and 2x12. However, the smaller the joist, the sturdier and less prone to bowing it will be.

, Standard post options include 4x4s and 4x6s. Generally, the thicker it is, the more support it will provide, so choosing the thicker post is a better idea. Low decks, however, have less to worry about.

, If you know you plan on adding a hot tub or other very heavy item to your deck, you may want to consider extra posts, mid posts, or trusses, as well as more joists, under the area where the heavy item will be located. This can prevent bowing and better support the extra weight.

, The Lowe's Deck Designer will walk you through the process of choosing what size and style your deck will be. It will also calculate the spacing for posts and joists, make a basic building plan for you to use, and calculate the cost to build the deck.

, This is similar to the Lowe's tool but may offer different, and more biased results.

, If you want to figure out how much space your deck will need in order to fit a certain configuration of furniture, use this tool, which allows you to set the dimensions of the area and then fit furniture into it and arrange it however you like. It is available as a browser extension but also as a website.

Make a baking soda and bleach paste.,
Make a vinegar and baking soda paste.,
Make a vinegar and water solution.",How to Clean Concrete Patio1," If you want to remove stains that have developed over a season or so (for example, after leaves have been collecting on your concrete throughout the fall), mix up a standard concrete cleaner using three parts baking soda and two parts bleach.The consistency of the paste should be like pea soup – thin enough to pour on your concrete but thick enough that it won’t just run off.;
, If you’re looking for a more environmentally-safe cleaner, try mixing up vinegar and baking soda. The exact amounts of vinegar to baking soda don’t matter as much as the consistency. It should have a paste-like consistency.Start by pouring some white distilled vinegar into a bucket or bowl and then slowly add baking soda. The mixture will foam up, so add the baking soda slowly so you it doesn't overflow. Give the bubbles some time to deflate so you can see what your consistency looks like before adding more baking soda., For smaller stained areas, you might want to try a vinegar, water, and salt solution that you can mix together in a spray bottle. This allows you to be more targeted in the application of the cleaner and prevents it from seeping to places you don’t want it to go – like flower beds or the lawn.


Use equal parts white distilled vinegar and warm water, then add a pinch or two of salt.Let this solution soak into your concrete for about twenty minutes.

Use an enzymatic cleaner on pet stains.,
Use an oil-based cleaner on non-washable crayon stains.,
Try laundry detergent on grease stains.,
Sprinkle kitty litter over oil stains.,
Use bleach and laundry detergent to remove mildew.,
Use vinegar to remove algae.,
Use a pressure washer.",How to Clean Concrete Patio3," If you have stains from pets or other animals on your concrete, try an enzymatic cleaner like OxiClean. These types of cleaners target and help to break down protein in stains.You should apply these types of cleaners directly to the stain without diluting them with any liquid and then let them soak into the stain.
However, it can take up to a few days for these types of cleaners to break down the stains on your concrete.

Keep your deck surface dry and debris-free.,
Watch for drainage issues.,
Keep the gaps between deck boards free of debris.",How to Clean a Composite Deck3," The combination of moisture and dirt/pollen will cause mold to start growing on your deck. To prevent this, keep the surface of your deck as clean and dry as possible. Make sure your deck has effective drainage around its perimeter and between the deck planks., Your deck should have, at minimum, 6 inches (15.24 cm) between the wooden planks and the ground beneath for ventilation. This allows the water to drain off the deck and into the soil without the wooden planks being forced to sit in the soggy ground. There should never be standing water underneath your deck.If you notice standing water underneath, you may need to use a different grade of soil around your deck to improve drainage.

, Pollen, leaves, dirt and other debris often get lodged in between the wooden planks. It’s easy to overlook this debris since it can’t be seen by glancing over the surface. Make sure you inspect the gaps and keep the spaces between the deck boards clean and free of debris."

Dig a hole at least 3 feet (or 1 meter) deep using a post hole digger.,
Place one of the posts into its hole and while holding it as level as you can, pour dry concrete into the hole until it is half filled.

,
Pour in roughly 5 inches (or 12.7 centimeters) of water and let the mix soak for a minute or two.

,
Fill the hole to about 5 inches (or 12.7 centimeters) from the top with more of the dry mix, adding another 5 inches (or 12.7 centimeters) of water until the hole is filled.

,
Add water as it is absorbed by the dry concrete until the mixture is thick enough to hold the post upright.

,
Repeat this process for the post on the opposite side.

,
Leave the posts to set for a day or two, or until the concrete is completely hardened.

,
Calculate, starting with the bottom hinge of your gate, how far above the ground it will need to be so that your gate moves freely and without hitting the ground anywhere within its full swing.

,
Drill a hole through the hinge post as straight as you can using a spade bit.

,
Screw a nut and a washer 1 inch (or 2.5 centimeters) onto the threaded end of the vertical hinge pin, and push it through the hole, so that the pin is pointed straight up.

,
Determine where your top hinge needs to be by first measuring the distance between the bottom hinge loop and the top hinge loop on your gate.,
Measure the distance between the hinge pin and the center of its threaded rod, add this to your measurement for the hinge loops and mark the resulting measurement with a line that runs up the inside of the hinge post to the hinge that is already in place.

,
Draw a line on the inside of the post that is level with the center of the pin already in place.

,
Push the hinge pin through the top hole as you did with the bottom pin without tightening the nuts.

,
Calculate how far the top pin needs to protrude from the post so that it is aligned with the bottom pin, then tighten the top pin's nuts into place.

,
Slide the hinge loops of the gate onto the hinge pins and tighten the clamps to hold it in place.

,
Let go of the gate, adjusting the hinge pins as needed so that your gate hangs motionless.

,
Attach your latching hardware about midway up the post opposite the hinge posts, making sure that all the parts are aligned so that they slip into place when the gate is closed.

Start with a list.,
Remember your home's color and style.,
Keep the weather in your area in mind.,
Weigh in any special considerations.,
Think about wicker furniture.,
Consider wood.,
Invest in quality plastic.,
Think about iron furniture.,
Take precautions when choosing fabric.,

Buy paint for bland furniture.",How to Buy Patio Furniture," You should make a basic list of what you're looking for before going to a store searching for furniture. A list can help remind you of your needs and prevent impulse purchases. You do not need to list the exact items you want, but you should list your general needs in terms of patio furniture.Begin by thinking about what kind of space you're hoping to create. Do you want a kitchen area to eat outdoors on summer nights? Do you merely want to create a place to lounge outside on nice days? Do you want to host cocktail parties outdoors?
Your list of needs can help guide your purchases. For a formal dining area, you need sturdy dining chairs and tables. For a casual lounge, you need lounge chairs and side tables.;
, You want your furniture to match with your home to a degree. If you have existing patio furniture, you should also keep this in mind. Try to go for furniture that matches with your style so it does not look out of place on your patio.Your patio furniture should be treated like any other furniture in your home. You want styles that match with your color scheme and taste. Very formal furniture may not pair well if your home has a more laid back vibe, for example.
You should also keep the size of your patio in mind. A very tiny patio will not look good with large, bulky furniture. Choose pieces that fit nicely into your existing space.

, If you're in an area prone to certain types of weather, this can affect the type of furniture you should buy. Keep weather conditions in mind when selecting outdoor furniture.You should also consider investing in an umbrella, awning, or patio tent.


If you live in an area prone to rain, you may want to invest in umbrellas.You should also look for furniture that's waterproof, or that comes with a waterproof covering.
Think about storage, as well. If you live in an area that's sunny year-round, you may be able to leave your furniture out all year. However, in most areas you'll need to store furniture at least some of the year. Choose pieces that will fit into the designated storage area in your home.

, Is there anything specific to your home you should keep in mind? Ask yourself this before selecting furniture. Maybe you have young children, so you'll need furniture that's very durable and stain resistant. Maybe you have pets who are likely to climb on the furniture, so you'll need to choose a material that's easy to clean. Jot down any special considerations, and what this means for the type of furniture you should buy, before heading to the store., Wicker furniture is one of the most popular materials for outdoor furniture. It's a very versatile material, and you can get many varieties of patio furniture with wicker.Wicker comes in a variety of colors. Many different types of furniture (tables, chairs, end tables) come in wicker varieties. You should be able to find something in wicker that fits your style and color scheme.
Wicker generally holds up against water. However, you should make sure your wicker is made out of polyethylene as this will be most weather resistant.

, Wood is another classic material for patio furniture. If you're looking for a practical, old fashioned style, wood may be your best option.Like wicker, wood comes in many different styles and colors. If you want wood furniture, you should be able to find a piece that matches your needs in wood. It should say somewhere on the label whether the wood is authentic.
However, make sure you're buying real wood. Many patio furniture labeled as wood is actually made of synthetic materials. Only real wood will hold up well long term.

, Plastic can be a cheaper option if your'e on a budget. Quality plastics are also very durable and resistant to many different types of weather. Plastics can be great if you're looking for patio furniture to last year round.Look for recycled plastic and polymer for best results. You should also keep your eyes out for plastics that come with UV-stabilizing pigments, as these will prevent colors from fading.

, Iron may work great if you live in an area prone to heavy wind or rain. Iron is of a heavier weight than other varieties, so it can stand its ground during volatile weather conditions.Iron works best for year round patio furniture that does not need to be moved much throughout the year. If you live in an area where it snows during winter, iron furniture must be stored inside.
Look for powder-coated, UV resistant finishes when choosing iron furniture.

, Fabric can be a great addition to patio furniture as it adds comfort. However, if you're choosing fabric, be careful. You want a fabric that is weather resistant and easy to store.Solution-dyed acrylic are best for fabric furniture. These fabrics are designed for outside use.
Choose cushions you can easily carry so you can move them indoors during rain or snowfall.

, Storage is a big factor when it comes to selecting patio furniture, especially if you live in an area where you can't keep furniture out year-round. Find furniture that's easily movable and will fit in your garage, storage shed, attic, or other area of your home.If you don't have a lot of storage space, invest in furniture that can be folded or taken apart easily.

, Oftentimes, patio furniture comes in sets. This can be cheaper than buying individual pieces. When looking for furniture, keep an eye peeled for patio furniture sold in sets.For example, say you're looking for a dining room furniture for your patio to host outdoor dinner parties. Many stores sell dining room sets. You may be able to get the chairs and tables you need at a bundled price.
Be willing to compromise a little on sets. If you find a set that's very cheap, it may be in your second choice color, style, or material. As long as the set still meets your needs otherwise, and is made of materials that work well given your climate and area, it may be worth it to save the money and go with your second choice.

, When choosing chairs, make sure you select chairs based on your needs. Lounge chairs will not go well if you want chairs to place around a dinner table. Stiff dining chairs won't work well if you're looking for a chair to relax in while reading outdoors.Many chairs also come in bundled packages with accessories, which can benefit you. If you're, say, looking for a relaxing outdoor lounge space, a chair that comes with an ottoman can be a nice touch.

, Dual purpose pieces can save you money and space on your patio. Look for, say, an ottoman that can also be used as an extra chair. Select a side table roughly the same length and width as your dining room table. This way, you can use it to extend the table during gatherings., Patio furniture can be purchased at hardware stores, antique shops, and department stores. You can also buy patio furniture online and have it delivered. If you're not fairly certain what you're looking for, it's probably best to see patio furniture prior to purchase rather than purchasing it online.

, If you bought furniture that does not come with its own cushioning, consider buying outdoor cushions of your own. Adding cushioning to patio chairs can increase their comfort.Outdoor cushions should be waterproof, resistant to mildew, and easily washable. Look for cushions specifically made to be used outdoors.
Measure chairs before buying cushions to make sure they will fit.

, An outdoor rug can add a nice touch to your patio space after you've assembled your furniture. As with any outdoor fabrics, look for UV-resistance to prevent fading. You should also make sure rugs are water resistant so they can hold up in all types of weather., Many types of patio furniture can be painted. If you've found the perfect piece, but it doesn't quite match with your color scheme, invest in some outdoor paint. You can paint your furniture the right color when you get home."

Plant a vine.,
Choose a hedge for shady sites.,
Plant a hedge for southern climates.,
Put up your own support.,
Plant a shade-loving vine:


Sambucus nigra 'variegata' - this gorgeous thing is a beacon even in full shade, and is pretty drought tolerant to boot.,
Plant a sun-loving cover.,
Plant for intermediate or mixed conditions:


Leycesteria formosa: this bamboo-like shrub has shoots that can go 6 feet (1.8 m) in a season once established.,
Show some of the fence, but cover it with something.,
Do something besides a hedge.,
Use plantings on the other side of the fence as an element in your own garden.,
Use the idea of garden rooms.,
Incorporate the fence in your own style.",How to Hide a Fence," A few Wisteria will grow quickly to cover the fence.;
, Hedges grow more slowly than vines, but they will cover better. Here are some suggestions for shade-loving hedges:


Eleutherococcus sieboldianus 'Variegatus' (Variegated Five-leaf Aralia) is really pretty with variegated foliage, grows easily in most soils, and reaches 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m).
/Symphoricarpos spp. (snowberry/coralberry)will grow fast almost anywhere, suckers freely, grows to about 6 feet (1.8 m) tall. It makes persistent berries for winter interest.
Cherry-laurel has the advantage of being evergreen.

,


Florida Anise makes a nice, dense, sweet scented hedge.

, If you really want to get away with a vine for the speed, but can't plant over your neighbor's fence, put up a simple fence or trellis of your own (maybe just wire between poles) and grow something over it fast. Crossvine, Dutchman's pipe, and some jasmines will all grow in deep shade. Even green beans or peas could be a quick cover. You could even make that a temporary measure while you find something else to plant in there.

, It can be trained upright along steps or a wall to well over 12 feet (3.7 m). It is deciduous.

,


Physocarpus opulus (either the green-leaved variety or ""Diabolo"", the purple leaved one). Also deciduous.
Ceanothus thyrsiflorus: evergreen, and impenetrable once in full growth.

,
Viburnums. There is one for every occasion. Viburnum x juddii is fragrant, and growing in part shade for me. Viburnum rhitidophyllum (leatherleaf) is dark and would look fabulous against that fence.
Hamamelis. ""Diane"" can reach to 12 feet (3.7 m). The fragrant yellow ones are even nicer and more vigorous.

, Try an espalier in front of the fence.

, Can you build a gazebo or trellis in front of the fence?

, If you can see a plant over or through the fence, plant two lower plants on your own side and your plants will look like a grouping, even though one of them is not yours. This can help to soften the appearance of a barrier.

, If you have even a bit of space, place something so that there is more garden beyond it. It will keep the feet and the eyes moving, soften the edges, and still conceal the fence from view out the window or from the patio that you want to use.

, Depending on the appearance of the fence, add coordinating elements that tie it into your own garden. For example, if it is a white, metal fence, you could use a shorter white metal fence or border somewhere in your own garden.

Be sure to paint, stain, varnish etc, the palings or pickets before you work with them.,
Measure how many you will need to cover each span of rails from post to post.,
Run a line of string at the base of the palings.,
Nail the palings into place along the string line.,
Space the palings.,
Draw a line in chalk across the top of the palings to mark the desired height of your fence.",How to Fix Palings or Pickets," This also applies to the posts and rails that will form part of the fence. It is much easier to paint etc. before you attach the palings.;
, You will need to space the palings or pickets as described below.

, This will form the line along which you will nail the palings to the fence rail.

, Use galvanized flathead nails, two nails per joint; if you need better grip, try angle nails.

, Use a block of wood to space palings or pickets to provide consistent spacing between each one.

, Be sure to keep it straight and consistent across all the palings. Cut the palings at this height, moving along the chalk line. Most pickets do not need to be cut as they already have their typical triangular shape in place (see image above).

Plot a straight line for you hedge to grow along.,
Choose a hedge plant and buy several bulbs of that plant.,
Remove weeds and other plants from your hedge line.

,
Till the ground.

,
Deposit 4 inches (or 10 cm) of fertilizing soil or compost.

,
Plant the bulbs.,
Lay 2 inches (or 5 cm) of mulch along the hedge line.

,
Water the hedge line so that the soil and mulch settle.

,
Water the plants a few times a week, or more during the summer.

,
Fertilize the plants with standard garden fertilizer twice a year.

,
Prune the plants at least once a year.,
Wait 3 to 5 years for your hedge to reach full-grown size.

",How to Grow a Hedge Fence,"


Normally, a hedge border runs along the edge of a property or a garden. Plot a line that runs over level ground with even access to sun and consistent soil along its entirety: remember that your hedge plants will need to grow evenly.;
,


Consult your local nursery for advice on which plants grow best in your climate. For a short hedge of up to 5 feet (or 1.5 meters), consider azaleas, dwarf oleander, or Indian hawthorn. For a tall hedge of 10 feet (3 meters) or greater, look at Japanese yew, pittosporum, and wax myrtle.

,,,,


Bulbs should be placed about 4 feet (or 1.2 meters) apart for most plants. Bury the bulbs about 3 inches (or 7.6 cm) into the layer of fertilizing soil or compost.

,,,,,


Pruning involves clipping leaves and branches from the top and sides of the hedge with garden shears. Remove any especially long branches or dense masses of leaves. Your goal is to create a consistent, full look along the length of the hedge.

Do not always rely on the Yellow Pages... You have to ask around the community firstly because these are people with first hand experience.,
Call your local Chamber and Better Business Bureaus.,
When you find a contractor that you are comfortable with, ask to see their portfolio.,
Almost all reputable businesses have a web presence now.",How to Find a Reputable Fencing Contractor," A fencing contractor that has a lot of word-of-mouth advertising is 110% better than one with a $1200 ad in the Yellow Pages. You have no way of knowing if he paid for that ad by ripping someone off or if he produces a quantity of cookie cutter jobs without customer input and customization.;
, You want to find out how long this company or contractor has been around, what's his history of complaints (if any), if they are active in the community... etc.. This can help you form a more accurate picture of the contractor's business dealings and how the company has handled complaint resolution.

, Portfolios are a source of pride to reputable businesses, the contractor should be more than willing to show you his portfolio along with give you the addresses of a few places with jobs similar to yours'. If the contractor is not forthcoming with the requested information, look harder.

, Get the contractor web address (if he has one) so you can review his site. Often times, they have placed additional tools on the site along with their portfolios and references. A little tool I use to check a website for original images in their portfolio is that I right on the background of the page, a drop down menu appears and towards the bottom you will see ""View Page Source"" or ""Get Source Code"" If you select view page source it will show you the originating website for any images that may have been copied. Site builder borrow images all the time; nothing really wrong with it if you advise the person you are borrowing from. That changes when you are a contractor trying to pass borrowed images off as your very own work.

Don't use power washers or chlorine bleach to wash your deck.",How to Clean a Deck with Bleach," Furniture will get in the way as you clean. Remove all planters, seats, and tables from your deck before you start to clean it., Use a dry brush or broom to get the initial dirt and dust off of the deck. If you do this before you get the deck wet, it will be easier to remove grime and algae later. Work in large sweeping motions and go up and down your deck until it's free of debris and dust.You can remove debris like sticks, leaves, and seeds with a leaf blower.

, Use a garden hose and spray in a uniform motion across the deck. If you have a pressurized attachment, you'll want to make sure that the pressure is not too high and not too low. Adjust the nozzle so that the hose creates a fan of water and not a single stream. If you don't have an adjustable nozzle, you can fit your thumb over half of the opening on the end of the hose to create a similar effect.If the pressure is too high on your hose, it can create discoloration on the surface of your deck.

, Pour 2 gallons (3.78 l) of warm water in a 5-gallon (18.92 l) bucket. Add 2 cups (400 g) of powdered oxygen bleach and mix the solution together using the sponge or brush that you'll be using to scrub down your deck. Continue to mix the solution until the components are well incorporated.Remember to wear water-proof gloves when working with bleach.

, If you don't have a deck brush, you can use a large porous sponge to scrub down the surface of your deck instead. Liberally saturate the surface of the deck with the solution, then start scrubbing the deck until the solution starts to lather.Synthetic deck brushes can be purchased at most hardware stores and are designed specifically to wash a deck.
Be careful when walking on your deck because the bleach solution will make it slippery.

, Letting the suds sit on the deck will allow the oxygen bleach to absorb the dirt and algae on your deck. It's important that you don't let the solution thoroughly dry on the deck, or it can leave a film on the surface., Use the hose to do a final rinse down of your deck. If you don't have a hose, you can get buckets of water from an indoor faucet and use that to rinse down the deck. Make sure that all of the bleach solution is rinsed away before letting your deck air dry.

, If you don't need to do a full cleaning of your deck, but you see an excess buildup of algae or dirt, you can make a more concentrated paste with your bleach. Simply add a little water to some oxygen bleach powder and mix the solution together with a spoon until it forms a thick paste. Apply the paste to the dirty areas of your deck with a nylon brush and let it sit for 15 minutes before thoroughly rinsing it off., Pour one cup (200 g) of borax into the bucket with your bleach and water solution. Mix it together while wearing gloves and target specific areas on your deck where mildew has formed.Borax can typically be found in the laundry detergent aisle of the grocery store and is a mineral compound that won't destroy your nearby plants., Power washers can sometimes be too powerful and could damage the wood forever. Instead of using a power washer, use a pressurized adjustment on your hose or a lighter pressure spray machine.Never use chlorine bleach to wash your deck. Chlorine bleach is toxic to plant life, can discolor your wood, and reduces the integrity of the wood."

Blot any stains that you see immediately with a paper towel so that it isn't as difficult to remove later on.Concrete is a porous material and absorbs oil and grease very easily.

, Put on a pair of gloves and dump 10 ounces (283.49 grams) of kitty litter into a bowl and add a couple of drops of acetone or nail polish remover to the bowl. Mix the solution together and then continue adding acetone until it starts to form a paste.If the paste is too dry, continue adding acetone to the bowl.
If your paste comes out too watery, add more kitty litter to the solution.
This combination of an absorbent material and a solvent is called a poultice.
You can use shredded paper towels, old newspapers, or sawdust as an alternative to kitty litter.

, Use your hands to spread the paste over the stains. Cover the paste with plastic wrap and allow the paste to oxidize for two hours. It should absorb some of the oil and grease stain., Once you've allowed the paste to sit and oxidize, you can remove it from the patio.

Use your gate.",How to Build a Wooden Gate," Aside from a fence in need of a gate, you'll need a few common hand-held carpentry tools to get started making your gate. It's likely you'll need:


Screwdriver
Power drill
Compound miter saw
Carpenter's level
Jigsaw, for cutting a decorative profile
3-inch stainless steel coated deck screws, for putting the box frame together
1 ¼ or 1 ⅝ stainless steel or coated deck screws, for planking
Hinges;
, The size of the gate should not be greater than 4' (1.22 m) in width. If it is wider, you must make and hang two gates, which will meet in the middle.


Measure the entry at the top and bottom as they can easily be different. Build the gate to be square based on the narrower measure. Take diagonal measurements to check for squareness.

, You need to make sure that hanging the gate won't pull the posts to one side. The way you anchor the post will depend on the size of the fence, but in general, you need to make sure the post doesn't wiggle with weight. If it can be easily moved, the gate will sag. You should also check and see that the post is level, straight up and down.


Ideally, a 4-foot (1.22 m) tall gate needs a 5"" x 5"" (12.7cm x 12.7 cm) redwood post. A 6-foot (1.83 m) tall gate requires a 6"" x 6"" (15.3 cm x 15.3 m) post.

, The frame for a basic wooden fence gate should be a simple box with 4 sides, usually somewhat smaller than the gate opening. If you've got a 3x5 opening in the fence, build a 3x4 box out of a weather resistant wood. The box should be about an inch less wide than the rough opening to account for hinges and the thickness of gate as it swings.


Typically, you'll want to use the same variety of wood used on the fence. If you want a different color, redwood is sometimes used for large gates. Whatever you choose to use, buy more lumber than you'll need to make sure you've got enough for the job.

, Start the gate by cutting the top and bottom pieces to the same width/length as you planned for, slightly smaller than the opening in the fence. Cut the upright side planks about 3 inches shorter than the height of the gate.

, Drill a pilot hole for the screws before putting them in so that they do not split the wood. Fasten with deck screws, pre-drilling to keep the wood from splitting. Measure from the top bend to the opposite bottom corner. Both sides should measure the same.


Typically, as you start assembling, the gate framing, it's good to lay it out on a flat surface, such as a patio or driveway. Attach the top and bottom rails to the side rails, making sure it is square.

, This helps maintain strength and rigidity. Connect these to the frame boards that match the rest of the fence by using deck screws, pre-drilling as before.


Make your diagonal cut with a mitre saw. Place the diagonal onto the box and trance with a pencil where the angles go.
Place the cross-brace at a 45 degree angle extending from the bottom corner of the gate to the opposite corner of the top of the gate., Once you've designed the frame and built it, all you need to do now is attach flat planks evenly over the front of the frame to finish your basic wooden gate. Measure planks from the top to the bottom of the frame and cut them accordingly. Leave at least ⅛ inch between the planks for weather allowances.


Cut planks using a table saw and secure them using deck screws, drilling pilot holes to keep your planks nice and clean.

, Most people like to take a little time to design the top of the gate and add a little decoration to it, using a jigsaw. If you don't want to take the time to, it's not necessary, but it's a good way to make the fence look nice. Generally, a beveled edge, an imprint of your last name, or other little decorative markers are popular.


To start, draw an arc across the top of the fence using a string and a pencil, filling it with decorative curves according to your taste. If you're a woodworker, feel free to get fancy with it. Use the jig to cut along your pattern.

, Put the gate into place, supporting it on the bottom with a 2x4 (1.5 inch off ground). Use a pencil to mark where the hinge should go on the post, and then put the gate down. Predrill where the screws will go. Prop up the gate and screw the hinges into the gate and attach the hinges to the post.

, Most easy-to-use fences will use a gravity latch, which you can install after you've hung the fence. Mark where the screws will go with a pencil, then drill pilot holes and install the latch. Get the fit first before you put any finish on the gate.

, Try to hit every exposed surface with your sealer, using a paintbrush or garden sprayer to apply. Most home retailers sell pads that are basically a sponge on a stick that you can use to spread it around, if necessary.


Try to cover the whole surface evenly, making sure you hit the bottoms of the planks, which tend to absorb more water than the face grains. This is the area most likely to rot or become discolored. Let dry for a couple hours in dry climates or a day in more humid climates.

, After you finish sealing the wood and have given it plenty of time to dry, your gate is ready to use! Open and close it to test it out.

This may be done in the United States by calling 1-888-258-0808 or dialing 811.;
, It's a good idea to consult with your neighbor(s) before you begin your project. Make sure you agree on the exact property lines, and ask their permission to work on their property, as it is much easier to erect a fence when you can work on it from both sides.

, Local zoning laws may require your fence to fit within certain size and placement regulations, so it's important to consult with a local authority before you purchase any materials. This is particularly common if you live in a historic area., In some locations, a building permit is required before you can build your new fence. Check with your local government office to find out what applications you need to fill in.

, An untreated post will only last about 3 to 7 years depending on soil condition and weathering. To extend the posts' lifespan by at least a few years, choose a naturally resistant wood such as cedar, yew, juniper, or oak. For best results (but a higher cost), buy pressure-treated posts that have been injected with water repellent.

You can also buy water repellent stains and apply a few coats to the end of the post. These usually contain copper naphthenate, an irritant, so follow all safety instructions on the label.Wrapping the end of the post tightly with heavy roofing felt or tar paper is better than nothing.
You'll need larger posts for the gates and corners, since these bear more weight.

, Before you begin digging, it's important to carefully plan the location of each fence post.


Fence posts are usually spread six to eight feet apart, with any corner posts being set first. Use larger posts for corners and gates.






Use wooden pegs to mark the location of each post and use a string line to align the posts and mark the line of the fencing., To dig each post hole, pull up the wooden peg and dig a hole approximately two feet deep, using a shovel and then a post hole digger. The post hole digger maintains the necessary width of the hole as it digs.

When digging the post hole, a good rule of thumb is to make the hole deep enough to bury 1/3 of the length of the fence post. This gives them better stability, helping them to withstand heavy weight and high winds.The post hole should be 10 to 12 inches wide.







, Position the posts in the center of each hole. Double check the distance between posts with a tape measure, then backfill the hole and brace the posts using three four-foot lengths of 2-by-4s, nailed diagonally to the post. This keeps the post in an upright position.


Use a bubble level to check that each post is standing vertically upright, rather than leaning towards one side or the other.

, When all of the fence posts have been erected, you will need to fill them using either concrete or post mix.

If using concrete, fill each post hole with the wet cement (which you should prepare according to the instructions on the packaging) and use a stick to stir the wet mix while pouring to eliminate any air pockets.






Overfill the top of the hole with concrete, then use a trowel to slope the concrete away from the fence post. This prevents water from collecting around the base. Alternatively, you can stop pouring the concrete a couple of inches from the top of the whole, then fill with soil once the concrete is dry.If you're using post mix (which has a significantly shorter drying time than concrete), you will need to half fill the post hole with water, then pour in the post mix until it reaches slightly below soil level. It is recommended that you wear a mask, goggles and gloves while you do this.







, While the concrete or post mix is still wet, use the spirit level to make sure each fence post is completely vertical. Make any adjustments if necessary. Leave the concrete or post mix to dry completely. Concrete may take up to 48 hours to dry.

, Lay a piece of timber across the tops of two consecutive fence posts and use a bubble level to check that the tops are level. If they are not, cut the tops of the posts to the correct height using a circular saw, chain saw, reciprocating saw, or hand saw.

, To attach the fence panels to the posts, you can either use rust resistant nails or exterior-grade brackets and screws.


Using nails: Position each fence panel between two posts so that the edges of the panels reach the center of the posts. Use a spirit level across the top supporting rail to ensure the fence panel is level. Use 18d or 20d galvanized nails to attach the panel to the posts, through the top and bottom supporting rails. You may need another person to hold the panel in position as you do this.







Using brackets and screws: Attach three brackets to the edges of each fence panel: one 8 inches from the top, one 8 inches from the bottom and one in the center. You can place a couple of off-cuts of gravel board, pressure-treated board, or spacer blocks at the base of each post to lift the fence panel off the ground while you work. Set each fence panel on top of the gravel boards then screw them to the posts. This prevents the wood from contacting the ground, where it would rot faster. (This three-rail system is the stronger option, but you can use two evenly spaced rails instead.)







Note: Some some store-bought fences will have mortise and tenon joints which you can simply slot into one another, instead of using nails or screws.







, In most cases, the bottom of the fence panels should not sit on the ground, as this makes them more susceptible to rot.If you wish to fill in the gap between the bottom of the fence panel and the ground, simply leave the gravel board in the gap and nail each end to the fence posts.


Spacer blocks not intended for ground contact should be removed after installing the fence.

, If you wish, you can finish off the job using post caps. These are small wooden squares which you nail to the top of each post to give the fence a more polished look and prolong the life of the posts., Applying a protective finish to your fence will help to keep it looking good for longer.

A paint finish will allow you to match your fence to the color of your home or other outdoor furniture. The wood should be completely dry before you paint it and coated in primer. Make sure to use an exterior latex paint.






Stains add a bit of life and color to the fence, while also preserving the natural look of the wood and allowing the grain to show through.






A waterproof finish or repellent is necessary for woods that don't withstand moisture very well and are prone to decay. Such woods include spruce, poplar, birch and red oak."
"
Be clear about what you need a fence for.,
Consider your budget.,
Think about the style that you need.",How to Find Ideas for Fences," This will guide your decision and expenditure on fencing choices. Common reasons for needing a fence include:


Making a property look ""complete"" - this can be merely decorative, or semi-functional
Keeping children safe
Keeping pets or livestock in and intruders out
Marking an area of a garden, such as a vegetable garden (and can also serve to keep out pests and weeds)
Serving as security for a property in an area where break-ins are common, or for a high profile person worried about security
Safety purposes - for example, permanently or temporarily fencing off a pool, a sewer, or any other area where accidents might occur, such as construction sites.;
, High quality fencing is not cheap. If you are prepared to build it yourself, you can save a lot of money, but be aware that it's also a lot of effort.

, Where a fence is decorative, or decorative and functional, the style is an important consideration. For a fence that is purely functional, the aesthetics might be less important. Styles of fences include:

Picket fences - wooden or plastic, these are suitable for residences, gardens, and smaller areas needing fencing off. They're not very practical for security purposes but they can keep in children and small animals provided they encircle an area completely.
Brick fences - these appear more like a wall but low-level brick fences can work well as decorative property delineation. Many brick fences in residential properties have the mailbox built into the brickwork too. For a more secure fence, a higher brick fence can be built, and to spare using too many bricks, arrangements can be made which add metallic grills, trellis, or other fillers in between brick posts forming the fence.
Metal fences - metal fences can be made in many shapes, including rectangular, square, oval, rounded, etc. A bar style is common, or a trellis design. Metal fences have the advantage of coming in all shapes and sizes, so you can make them as high or low as needed. They can deter break-ins because they are strong and allow viewing of movement from the street. Metal fences can be constructed from either aluminum or wrought iron and both types should meet certain specifications for strength and durability. Wrought iron is stronger than aluminum and ideal for high-security areas, but aluminum is more cost-effective and can more easily be placed on sloping terrain.






Wooden fences - Simple boards can be used to make fences in differing ways. There are many different wood fence designs that you can use to complement your home and garden. Wood fences come in many styles, ranging from very common to unique and intricate. Some common wood fence types include spaced board, gothic, colonial, dog-eared, lattice, board on board, and board and batten.
Wire fences - More commonly used on farming properties, stringing wire (including barbed wire, and electric wire) can form good fences for keeping stock in and predators out. For coops, use chicken wire to deter predators.






A horse fence - this consists of well-made wooden fencing, often painted in white, that is sufficient to keep horses on a property (such as a ranch, stables, or a farm).

If there are any restrictions on fences in your neighborhood or in your city, then all your hard work can be torn down. Check with your local planning department and neighborhood association before you get too far into the process.;
, Most cities require a building permit in order to place a fence. This to help keep you safe! Many electrical, gas and sewer lines, as well as water mains are buried at the levels you will be digging to. When you apply for a permit, you should also call 811 to request that your local utility companies come out to the site and mark any areas where pipes and wires are located.This will help to ensure the safety of your project.

, You'll want to be sure that you're using wood that will last a long time, right? If you use the best woods and treat them well, a wood fence can last 20 years or more. But choose the wrong wood and your fence might only make it 5 years. Consult with your local lumberyard to find the best wood for your area, but treated woods are usually your best option.

, There are also lots of different styles of wood fences. Do some research before you start so that you don't end up with builder's remorse! There are picket, lattice, concave, convex, board on board, shadowbox, privacy, and many other styles with just as many variations within each style. Each style also has specifics of how the fence should be built and how the boards should be placed.


This articles is general and can apply broadly to many fence styles, but you might want to find specifics on your fence style to compliment these instructions.

, Determine where your property line is before you start, so that you don't accidentally go over. Best advice is to hire a Registered Land Surveyor in your home state to mark the property line for you before you begin construction. Your city or town usually does not keep very detailed records of your property's boundary information. GIS (geographic information system) maps and Assessors maps are highly inaccurate when it comes to property boundaries.


You can search for Property\Survey Pins on your property. These are also located on corners of a lot. Just because an old fence or other “assumed” property boundary was\is in place that does not always mean that it is correct.

, Choose a fence height before getting too far into the project. Six foot is normal for a privacy fence, a livestock fence four feet high is usually sufficient, and picket fences are often three feet high. Fence height is important in the early stages, as it determines things like post hole depth.


Most cities have a height ordinance, so be sure to check this before you choose your fence height.

, Place stakes at the corners roughly where you wish your fence to go.

, Tie string around the stakes and run the string between stakes. Use a square or square-level to make sure that the corners"" where our stakes are placed are squared (the two sides form a 90° angle).


You can also square the corners by measuring the strings. Measure 3' on one side and 4' on the other. If the distance between the two marks (diagonally) is equal to 5', then the corner is square.

, Measure out lengths of 8' or less along the strings once you've square your corners and stake those locations to indicate the location for your support posts.


You generally want to take the total distance and divide it by 8 but if you have a length of fence that is not divisible by 8, you'll need to break it down into smaller sections. For example, a 24' fence would need 2 middle posts to create the three 8' sections, but a 25' fence would need 3 middle posts at 6.25' for each section in order to look even and be structurally sound.
To find the length and number for odd fence lengths, go up to the next number of posts and then divide the total length of the fence by the number of resulting sections.

, Use a post-hole digger to dig holes at the locations you staked. The posts will need to be buried at least 33% as deep as they are tall (example: an 8' high fence needs a hole 2.5' deep), so your hole will need to be at least that depth plus a few extra inches.


The hole should be wide enough that there is room around the post when you put it in.
Because soil conditions vary, and the height of the fence, the type of fencing, and other factors must be considered in determining how deep the post should be, you will have to calculate the hole depth for yourself.

, Place 3-4"" of gravel at the bottom of the hole. Place the post in the hole and get it into alignment. Check to make sure that the corners are still square, use a post leveler to make sure it is straight, and make sure it is sitting at the correct height.

, Carefully holding your post in place, pour in instant concrete until the hole is 2/3 full. Add water to the top and use a stirring stick to mix the cement. Prop the post into place (stabilize using temporary nailed boards if necessary) and allow the concrete to set following the manufacturer's instructions.

, Fill any remainder of the hole with dirt once the concrete has set.

, Pull a builder's line from one end post to the other, at an equal height above the ground, preferably at the top of the post (if your posts were placed correctly). This will help you keep the height of the fence the same along the way.

, Cut 2x4 rails (or horizontal support boards) to the appropriate length to reach between the centers of the posts. If you can, use a single rail for the entire length of the fence section. Rails should be no more than 24"" apart, so most fences will have 2-3 rails. Attach the rails using decking screws.

, With your support boards in place, you can attach your pickets (vertical boards, also called privacy boards). There are many different styles and ways of doing this, depending on how you want your fence to look. The most basic is a board on board fence, where the fence boards are nailed (using a nail gun, nailed at the support boards) with the distance of less than one board between them. Place the first board up and then use a level to “plumb” (vertical level) the board. Then, nail or screw the board in place. Use a spacer and then place the next board. Use the level periodically to check that it is “plumb.”


These boards are usually 1X6 rough sawn lumber but you can buy other pre-cut fencing boards as well.
If nailing the boards by hand, use 8d spiral shank galvanized nails.

, Once you're done, you will want to treat the boards to increase the longevity of your fence. You can paint your fence, stain it, or simply apply a weather-proofing finish to keep your fence looking great for years to come. Enjoy!


This will usually either contain silicone solids, or linseed oil. If you plan on painting a finish paint, stick with an oil based sealer, and use an oil based polyurethane paint or exterior enamel for the finish paint.

Get a soft bristle brush.,
Heat up the grill.,
Clean the grill grates.",How to Clean Porcelain Grill Grates1," Porcelain grill grates can chip easily if you use a metal or wire bristle brush. Avoid this by using a soft bristle brush, such as a brush made with nylon bristles. This way, the porcelain is not at risk of getting damaged when you clean it.You can get a standard square head soft bristle grill brush or try a grill brush with a rounded head. A soft bristle grill brush with a rounded head can make it easier to clean the grates.;
, The grill will be easier to clean when it is warm. Heat up the grill to burn off any excess food on the grill grates. Then turn off the grill and let it cool for a few minutes. Get the brush ready, as you will want to clean the grates while they are still hot.Alternatively, you can leave the grill on a low heat setting to prepare for the cleaning.

, Take the soft bristle brush and run it diagonally along the grates. Do this in smooth, fluid motions from the bottom to the top of the grates. Running the brush diagonally over the grates, rather than straight over the grates will make it easier to remove food and grease on the grates.Do one pass over the grates with the brush in a diagonal motion. If there are any really greasy or sticky parts of the grill, lightly go over the area a few times with the brush. Do not scrub too hard on the grates as this can damage them.
If the grill grates can be flipped over, wait until the grates have cooled. Then, use an oven mitt or heat proof gloves to flip over the grates and clean the other side with the grill brush.

"
"
Clean the grates with tin foil.,
Apply a baking soda solution to remove grease.,
Use water on the grates.",How to Clean Porcelain Grill Grates2," If you do not have access to a grill brush, you can use household products like tin foil to clean the grates. Ball up aluminum foil, making a ball large enough to fit over your fingers. Then, run the aluminum foil over the grates to remove any debris and clean them.Clean the grates with tin foil when they are cool or not too hot to prevent burning your fingers. Make sure there is enough tin foil on your fingers to create a buffer between your fingers and the grates.

, If your porcelain grill grates are really dirty, you can try applying a baking soda solution to them. Make a paste by combining ½ cup baking soda in ¼ cup warm water. Apply the paste to the grill grates. Let it sit for 20 minutes and then clean it off with a soft bristle grill brush.Make sure you get all of the paste off before you cook anything on the grill.

, If the grime and grease on the grates do not come off with just a brush, you can try dipping the grill brush in water and using it to clean the grates. A wet grill brush can help to remove debris on the grates effectively.Let the grill grates heat up. Then, dip the grill brush in a bucket of water to get it wet. Run the wet grill brush over the grates in a diagonal motion, starting from the bottom of the grate and going upward.
Dip the grill brush back in the bucket of water to rinse it and continue to clean any other areas on the grates with the wet brush.

Get a cleaner that is safe for use on porcelain.,
Apply the cleaner.,
Remove excess cleaner before using the grill.",How to Clean Porcelain Grill Grates3," It’s a good rule of thumb to do a deep clean on your grill twice a year. If your porcelain grill grates are really dirty, use a professional grill cleaner for a deep clean. Read the label on professional cleaners to ensure they are safe for use on porcelain grill grates. Most manufacturers will state if they are safe for use on porcelain grates.You can buy a professional grill cleaner online or at your local hardware store. Most grill cleaners come in a spray bottle for easy application.

, Let the grill cool down or apply the cleaner when it has been shut off overnight. Spray the cleaner all over the grates and let it sit. Then, use a clean grill brush to gently remove any dirt or food debris on the grates.If the grates are really dirty, you may have to do a few passes with the grill brush.
If there is a lot of deep grime caked onto the grates, you can also try spraying the grill cleaner and leaving it on overnight. Then, clean it off with the grill brush the following day.

, Wipe down the grill grates with a clean soft cloth or paper towels. This will ensure there is no excess cleaner on the grill grates so your food doesn’t end up tasting like cleaner when you grill it.


Another option is to heat up the grill before you start grilling to burn off any excess cleaner.

We breakdown the overall example layout listed above, into smaller linear runs, like from point A to point B, and point B to point C and so on.,
- In this run, B to C, we have a 4' wide gate which is measured from the inside of the gate post to the inside of the other Gate Post, point C. Because we already added the first gate post in the previous section, all we have in the second run is:


4 Wide Gate
Gates include self closing hinges and Z-Lock Lockable Latch and can be upgraded to heavier framing or to an Arch Gate.,
- From C to D which is to the Corner Post, we'll have 9' of fence which equals 1.5 panels (9 divided by 6' wide panel), rounded to 2 Panels and 1 Line Post (2 panels minus 1 = 1 Line Post).,
- From D to E which is to another Corner Post, the length is 40'.,
- From E to F which is to a Gate Post, the length is 42' which is divisible by 6'.,
- From F to G which is to another Gate Post, the width of the Gate is 3' (again, inside of post to inside of post.,
, 8a, & 8b - The next three runs, from G to J can be done the same way as the previous three sections which lead to another Gate Post.

,
- This last run, J to K is a 10' wide double gate.",How to Create a Material List for Installing Your Own Aluminum Fence,", In the example layout, we start at point A with an End Post 2-3"" away from the house and go away from the house 10' to point B which is a Gate Post. In this first 'run', we have 10' of fence, which divided by 6' (the width of the panels) equates to 1.67 panels which is rounded up to 2 because the panels are only shipped in 6' widths. Because there are 2 panels, we will have only 1 Line Post. Line posts quantities are equal to the number of panels minus 1. So in this first run from A to B, you will have:


1 End Post
2 Fence Panels
1 Line Post
1 Gate Post (these are typically just like End Posts but with a thicker wall. Point K is going to be a Blank Gate Post) Also, all posts come with a flattened pyramid cap standard. You may wish to upgrade to a ball cap.

,
1 Gate Post

, So here is this runs total:


1 Line Post
1 Corner Post
2 Fence Panels These panels can be installed in widths of 6' with the other panel cut down to 3' wide or both panels can be cut down to 4.5' to give a more even look. The same is true for the first section of 10'. It could be 6' wide and 4' wide or both cut to 5' wide. Not many, if any, of these runs will work out to be an exact measurement divisible by 6', so some cutting of the panels will be required during the installation process.

, Divided by 6 equals 6.67 panels (40 divided by 6' wide panel), rounded to 7 Panels and 6 Line Posts (7 panels minus 1 = 6 Line Posts). Here is this runs total:


6 Line Posts
1 Corner Post
7 Fence Panels 6 of these panels can be used without any cutting of the panels, but the last one will need to be cut down to 4' wide.

, This equals 7 panels and 6 Line Posts (7 panels minus 1 = 6 Line Posts). Here is this runs total:


6 Line Posts
1 Gate Post
7 Fence Panels

, This run only has:


1 Gate Post
3' Wide Gate gates include self closing hinges and Z-Lock Lockable Latch and can be upgraded to heavier framing or to an Arch Gate.

,, It can be two standard gates or two Arches next to one another or one big Arch (Rainbow) across the whole width. Also, as mentioned previously, the final Gate Post should be Blank which means it has no holes for fence rails to slide into like the End, Line and Corner Posts have. In this final run you would have:


1 Blank Gate Post (the other Gate Post would have been included in the previous run)
10' Wide Double Gate gates include self closing hinges and Z-Lock Lockable Latch and can be upgraded to heavier framing, Arched Gates or a Rainbow Gate.

Make sure your fence has aluminum or galvanized steel supports at the bottom. This metal will ensure that your fence stays straight. Wood supports will cause the fence to wave. Steel supports, other than galvanized steel, will rust and deteriorate over time.
Choose fencing that is .150 inches (0.4 cm) thick rather than other fencing that is .120 or .135 inches (0.3 cm) thick. This will be more durable and prevent dents.
Choose fence hardware that is stainless steel or galvanized steel. You want the hardware to be strong but avoid rust.
Choose a long-term fencing company that is likely to last well into the future. Inevitably, vinyl fences require some part replacements over the years. If your brand of vinyl fencing is no longer in production, you will find it difficult to keep your fence sturdy and attractive through the years.

, This online search tool is an effective way to look at the different types of vinyl fences and decide what you want. For example, you can choose a privacy, semi-privacy, post and rail or decorative vinyl fence.


Go into home improvement stores or look on this site to get a starting point for comparison shopping. Most of these stores provide vinyl fence without installation, for people who like to do their own home improvement. You should decide what your skill level is before deciding to take on a vinyl fencing project yourself.

, The main draw of these businesses is that they install the fence themselves, so they are able to guarantee the work they do in case your fence warps with the weather. Request several quotes, taking into account the guarantees and services they provide.

, If this is a large job and you can install the fence yourself, this may be the best way to buy. Search for quotes on sites like buydirectvinylfence.com, wholesalevinylfencing.net and vinylmartdepot.com.


Keep in mind that some of these sites put you into contact with vinyl fence dealers from around your area. They will use your email address or phone to contact you after you ask for a quote. Use an email address other than your business address.

,


Fence post holes should be wider at the bottom than at the top. This will help to keep the fence post steady in case of frost. If you make them wider at the top, the fence can get pushed out of the ground during a frost.
Fence posts should be placed below frost depth. This depth will depend upon your location; however, you should be exact in your depth to avoid installing fence posts that are no longer steady after cold weather.
Do not install fence post sections too tightly. They need some room to move with changes in heat and moisture. If you are unsure of the correct way to install them to avoid warping, get quotes on installation.

, Vinyl is considered a lifetime product, so choose a company that is willing to back that up and provide replacements if anything goes wrong. It may save you more money in the long run to choose a fence with a warranty than to go with a lower cost fence without a warranty.

, Look for reviews and go to the Better Business Bureau website to see how many outstanding problems they have with clients. If they get a bad rating, you may want to look for another provider.

, Buying with a credit card creates future proof of the transaction, and most credit cards provide you support in the case of fraudulent companies. If your product does not arrive or arrives with problems, you can file a complaint with the credit card company as well as the fencing company.

, Vinyl fencing that is installed in hot or cold weather is likely to move and warp when the weather fluctuates. Choose a date carefully, taking into account the temperatures in your area.

Start by getting a lot of stones, fairly consistent with the size of the wall you're building.,
Make sure the spot is sturdy before you start, and will hold your wall.,
Decide how wide and how long it should be, where you want it and how high it should be (mark this, either with ruler/yardstick or a grid/blueprint).

,
As a rule, a dry stacked wall should lean in towards the top 1/6 of the height.

Lay out a side rail (with something long like sticks, rulers, wood, small stones) to guide you, and outline where you want your wall, so that your wall is consistent.,
You may want to call for help.,
Put a layer of larger flat rocks along the inside of your wall.,
Continue to build up layers until your base is high enough, and check to ensure that it's level.",How to Build a Stone Fence," Get big stones for a big wall, smaller stones for a smaller wall. Make sure you have a good supply of smaller stones that can fill gaps. You may want to use stone blocks.;
, If the base is uneven, use a leveling line to correct it.

,,, To make a straight and level wall, get string or flagging tape and tie it between posts on both ends of the fence. Make sure to tie the string / flagging tape at the height you want your fence to use as a guide.

, Call a professional, strong friends, or neighbors who can help you. Use a wheelbarrow or a handcart to move heavy stones. Extraordinarily large stones may need to be moved with special power equipment.

, Make sure you fill in the spaces, and it's a fairly even layer, and patch-in holes/spaces with dirt or more dirt to give you a good base.

, To make a strong wall try to place each stone over the gap between two stones beneath it.

Hose off a portion of the fence first.,
Scrub while it’s still wet.,
Repeat until the whole fence is finished.,
Identify trouble areas.,
Use other cleaners only where necessary.,
Decide on a cleaner.,
Double-check recommendations from the fence’s manufacturer.,
Start with a mild solution.,
Test it on a hidden portion of the fence.,
Scrub and rinse.,
Scrape off any crusted or dried spots.,
Rinse again.",How to Clean a PVC Fence," Attach a spray nozzle to your garden hose. Set it to its jet setting. Blast away as much debris as you can from a section of your fence.Start at the top and work your way down to the bottom of the fence so debris is forced downward.You’re going to scrub it next while it’s still wet, so only hose off a few feet at a time so it doesn’t dry off.;
, Use a brush, sponge, or wet cloth. Scrub the area that you just hosed down. Wash off as much dirt, debris, or staining as you can with water alone., Move on to the next section of your fence. Hose it down and scrub away. Continue until the whole length of your fence has been hosed and scrubbed.Washing your fence with plain water once or twice a year should prevent buildup and the need for stronger cleaners., Take a step back and look at your handiwork. Assess which areas appear sufficiently clean and which require something tougher than plain water alone., Expect most (if not all) cleaners to be harmful to any vegetation growing below and/or along the fence line. Protect your grass, flowers, or other plants by using something harsher than plain water only when and where you really have to., If water alone doesn’t do the trick, don’t worry about having to go out and buy something special for the job. Expect common household items to do the trick. Use either:


BleachVinegarMild dish detergent, Keep in mind that different manufacturers use different components to make their own PVC fences. Be aware that what’s safe to use on one may not be safe to use on another. Before you use any product other than water on your fence, refer to your owner’s manual or the manufacturer’s website to confirm what chemicals are safe to use., Again, expect cleaning agents to kill vegetation. Play it safe and start by mixing a very small amount of bleach, vinegar, or dish detergent into a full bucket of water (like an ounce for every gallon of water). See how well this works before adding more.If the buildup in question is mold and mildew, opt for bleach. This will clean the present growth as well as prevent future buildup. However, remember that this may also harm underlying vegetation, and may not be recommended by particular manufacturers for your specific fence., Before you start washing away with your cleaning solution, make sure it won’t adversely affect its appearance, especially if it’s painted a dark color. Pick an area hidden from view where a blemish won’t stick out. Wet your brush, sponge, or cloth in the solution and dab the fence with it. Let it dry and judge its appearance before washing elsewhere., Soak your brush, sponge, or cloth in your solution. Wring out the excess. Scrub the trouble areas. Use your hose to rinse them off afterward., If any stubborn spots appear to have dried or crusted over your fence, grab a soft plastic scraper if your brush, sponge, or cloth didn’t do the job. Wet the area again with your cleaning solution. Then pick away at them while being careful not to apply so much pressure that you scratch or otherwise damage the fence., Hose off each area of the fence where you used your cleaning solution. Wash away all traces of your cleaner. Get rid of any soapy film so new dirt doesn’t have a helping hand in clinging to your fence."

Pick out a basic variety of shrub.,
Decide where the fence will go.,
Sow the plant seeds or clippings.,
Tie the branches together.",How to Build a Living Fence1," For most people, plants like privet, laurel, yew or holly will make practical, no-frills living fences. These shrubs tend to grow tall and develop thick foliage, making them well suited for promoting privacy and banishing pests. They can also be purchased inexpensively, making them a cost-effective way to fence in vast pieces of land.Shrubs can be groomed into symmetrical designs or planted in conjunction with other flowering bushes, adding visual appeal your property.;
, Survey your property to determine where you want to plant your line of shrubs. If you raise livestock or own a spacious tract of land, you might choose to erect the fence around the outer boundary of your property. If you’re planting a fence for aesthetic reasons or to give you more privacy, put some thought into your desired layout for the area you’re working with.Thick shrubs are well suited for lining off crops and flower beds.
Calculating the exact area you intend to fence off will give you an idea of the amount of seeds or clippings you’ll need to plant.

, Dig a series of holes around the area you've selected to grow your living fence. Place the seeds or clippings in the holes and cover them back up with soil and a thin layer of mulch. The individual shrubs should be tightly grouped while having enough room not to choke one another’s growth or compete for nutrients.The exact distance needed between different types of plants varies. Most shrubs and flowering plants can be spaced about a foot apart. The shrubs will continue to spread and fill out as they flourish.

, Twist a plant tie or length of wire around nearby branches where they intersect. Over the years, the branches will eventually grow together, forming a tightly-woven, impenetrable mesh. This process is called “inosculation,” and is used to turn many species of shrubs and flowerings plants into more effective barricades.By strategically positioning and tying the plant’s branches, you can create a dense natural gridwork that will keep even the smallest invaders out.
Make sure smaller branches have enough room to keep growing."

Send out invitations.,
Unpack and organize your home.,
Provide a variety of food and drinks.,
Expect to host a tour.,
Choose a home dedication or blessing.,
Send thank you cards.",How to Celebrate Moving Into a New Home1," Invitations can be sent out via the postal service, your phone, your email, or even by creating an event on Facebook. Use the medium you feel most comfortable with. Online invitations can be easier, as you will not have to locate the addresses or phone numbers of all of your friends and family members.


If sending out paper invitations is too time-consuming or stressful, consider using an online invitation site capable not only of sending invitations, but also keeping track of RSVPs.
Make sure you include the time, your address, and any additional pertinent details, such as details for parking, and general directions to your home.;
, A housewarming party is difficult to plan and follow through on if there are boxes stacked everywhere, or you are in the middle of painting. Clean and arrange your home prior to the party, choosing a date that best suits your needs.Typically, the first 2 weeks after moving into a new place, you are busy setting up, cleaning, and making any needed changes. Give yourself a two-week grace period, and have the party after your home is unpacked and settled into.
Make sure all valuables are secured before the day of the party. While you likely trust your guests, it is better to keep valuables hidden or under lock and key than to end your party and discover something missing.

, When you throw a party, your guests will likely expect food of some sort. Depending on how large your party is, providing all of the food can get expensive. Fortunately, you have the option of making a meal yourself, doing a potluck dinner, or providing light snacks and cocktails.If you are making a meal yourself, make sure you have an accurate headcount. Be sensitive to the dietary needs of others, and provide at least two main dishes, one of them vegetarian or vegan.
If you go the route of a potluck dinner, give your guests an idea of how large a party you expect, and the types of foods they might want to bring, such as dips or side dishes.
If your preferred method of feeding is finger foods and cocktails, provide a wide variety of options, from mini sandwiches to vegetable and cheese platters. Have plenty of back-up drink mixes and serving platters, as finger foods tend to go quickly.

, Part of a housewarming party is showing off your new digs. Prepare accordingly, but feel free to avoid entering bedrooms, garages, and other reasonable off-limits spaces. If you feel comfortable, you can also give your guests the option of meandering through your home according to their own time and interests., As part of your housewarming party, you can invite guests to say a few words to invite positivity and light into your home. This can be a religious ceremony, or can be a secular one--the choice is entirely yours.You can contact your religious or spiritual leader for information about any traditional rituals or practices your faith might have. They may need to be performed by a religious layperson, or may be able to be performed by you or a loved one.
If you’d like a secular home dedication or blessing, consider inviting family or friends to speak positivity or their own blessings into your home.
Utilize meaningful items. For some, this might mean religious icons, while for others, this might be as simple as some incense or a bundle of sage. Keep in mind that this is your home, and your blessing; it can be whatever you want it to be.

, You can have a small book available by your front door for guests to write a quick note in, along with their address, or you can send follow-up notes online.


Many guests will show up with a gift. Although it is considered rude to request gifts, don’t forget to express sincere gratitude for any gifts brought.
Make writing notes a family affair, if there are multiple people in your family. This will get the work done more quickly, and will be a more personal, intimate touch than a generic card from a single family member.

Invest in beautiful flowering plants.,
Create a support structure.,
Use the support structure to guide plant growth.,
Water the plants regularly.,
Keep the fence pruned.",How to Build a Living Fence2," If you’re a homeowner in a suburban area with no reason to be concerned with the threat of wind erosion or passing herds of deer, consider growing a beautiful sweep of forsythia or enkianthus around your home. Not only do these plants make good natural fences, they’re also pleasant to look at. Their foliage is dotted with delicate, colorful blossoms, which will add aesthetic charm to any yard or garden.Some other flowering plants commonly used as natural barriers include rose bushes, lilac and hydrangea.Flowering shrubs attract insects that in turn help pollinate them and prolong their lives.

, Depending on the species of flowering plant you’ve chosen to serve as a living fence, you’ll need to have some system of guiding and supporting the plants as they grow. Set out a line of tall wooden stakes or a low arch reinforced with heavy-gauge wire. Use flexible plant wire to attach the stalks of the plants to the vertical supports.Your supports should be wide enough to house a row of developing seedlings.
If your fence is to be especially long or follow an intricate path, you may need to build multiple support structures.

, Sow the seeds of your flowering plants just in front of the vertical supports you installed, roughly 2-3 feet apart. The support structure will act as the backbone for your fence, ensuring that it grows tall and straight and acting as a barrier or its own while the plants are still young.


A dedicated reinforcement structure can help ensure that flowering plants grow taller than they otherwise might if left unsupported.
Retie the plant's stems as needed to shape its growth as it spreads out.

, Your living fence should receive plenty of water while it’s in its initial stages of development. Make rounds with a watering can once a day around midday, or twice a day in hotter months or dry climates. Controlling the amount of moisture your plants receive will accelerate their growth and help them flourish.Shower the soil around the roots of flowering shrubs and leafy hedges every few days. Trees and large, woody shrubs will only need to be watered once or twice a week.
Avoiding overwatering your living fence. If your plants stop growing suddenly or appear wilted or colorless, reduce the amount or frequency of waterings., As your living fence matures, it will begin to grow around the support structure, and its branches and foliage will spread. Trim excess growth at its peak to control its spread and establish a clear boundary around your property. Shape your fence to whatever height, width and direction your needs or preferences dictate.For agricultural purposes, the fence should be tall enough to provide privacy and confine large livestock like goats, cows and horses, with closely tangled branches that will keep out scavenging animals.
The cuttings from most plants can be replanted and used to grow more natural fencing."
"
Cultivate a hedge of trees.,
Plant the seeds.,
Keep young trees watered.",How to Build a Living Fence3," Planting tall, lush trees can turn your property into a slice of paradise while providing privacy, shade and protection from runoff and erosion. Many different types of trees can be grown easily in a variety of climate conditions and require little maintenance once they’re fully developed. They also make prime habitats for a diversity of local flora and fauna, restoring a natural balance to the surrounding environment.A few tree species that make excellent living fence options include oak, sugar maple, willow and green giant arborvitae.Keep an eye out for scavengers if you decide to line your property with fruit trees. Squirrels, birds and raccoons are just a few of the animals known for stealing fruit right off the branch.

, Once you have an idea of what tree species to go with and where to plant them, go around and dig holes at regular distances along the boundary line you've decided on. Trees should be planted a few feet apart to give them plenty of room to grow and keep them from strangling one another. After replacing the topsoil, cover it with a thin layer of mulch.Spreading a layer of mulch at the base of your trees will help deliver vital nutrients to the maturing roots and protect the trees from dehydration and damage.
Timely application of nitrogen-rich fertilizers can also help you grow a healthy treeline much faster., Natural rainfall will take care of the tree's moisture needs once they're developed, but while they're still growing it will be important to water them frequently. Because of their size and rate of development, trees typically need copious amounts of water. Soak the soil around the trunk until the water just begins to collect on the surface.Overwatering trees can cause them to weaken and die. You only need enough water to thoroughly moisten the soil around the trunk to a depth of a few inches. Avoid the temptation to water trees until the soil is saturated and soggy.

Select a rugged plant species.,
Identify your plants' unique traits and needs.,
Inspect for damage and disease.",How to Build a Living Fence4," Those who are tired of having their crops stolen or their land trampled by unwanted marauders can use tough, intimidating plant varieties to deter intruders once and for all. When situated in tight clusters, bamboo is as impenetrable as a brick wall, while plants like hawthorn, pyracantha and even cactus feature sharp thorns and spines that can be punishing for critters that try to slip between their branches. Best of all, these plants are usually quite resilient—they’re often capable of surviving long periods with little or no water and they’ll last for years.Be careful when selecting prolific species like bamboo to use as a living fence, as they can easily spread out of control if they’re not carefully maintained.Cactus and similar plants are good for dry, arid climates where other types of plants have difficulty thriving.

, Make an effort to learn about your chosen plant's preferred climate, nutritional needs and cycles of growth and development before planting haphazardly. Cactus plants, for instance, don't require much moisture to thrive, and overwatering can easily kill them. Similarly, bamboo must be planted carefully and strategically to prevent it from overtaking large areas due to its natural ability to proliferate with great speed. These are all worthwhile factors to consider before deciding on a species that will be sharing space with and protecting other plants on your property.Succulent plants like cactus should be watered heavily, then allowed to soak up the moisture until the surrounding soil is completely dry.For the purpose of growing a living fence, clumping bamboo is an excellent species, as you can plant it freely without worrying about it spreading out of control., Every couple weeks, walk the perimeter of your living fence. Be on the lookout for blights, withered buds or places where the plants have been broken by harsh weather or animal activity. Repair these areas by fertilizing, watering, pruning or reinforcing them with external supports. If left untreated, disease and structural defects could overtake your fence, rendering it ineffective.Pay particular attention to spots where animals appear to be getting in or out.
Vigilance and frequent attention will help keep your natural fenceline healthy and lush.

Host your party outdoors.,
Drop off invitations.,
Create a casual atmosphere.,
Prepare finger food.,
Prepare games.,
Prepare to answer questions.",How to Celebrate Moving Into a New Home2," While you will likely want to share the inside of your home with family and friends, you may be uncomfortable inviting strangers into your home, especially if you have valuables strewn throughout. You can choose to have your party inside, but when inviting a lot of unknown people, it is safer to host it in your front or back yard, or a designated park or picnic space.If you do choose to have your party outdoors, make sure you have necessary protections against bugs and temperatures. In summer, consider using outdoor fans and mosquito candles, while in winter, you can rent small outdoor space heaters.

, Unlike a housewarming party, which invites guests from all over, a getting to know you evening is specifically for neighbors. Drop off your invitations personally, taking a moment to introduce yourself.The simplest way to get to know your neighbors is to knock on the door and say hello. Introduce yourself and your family, if applicable, and offer your invitation, while telling them a little bit about what to expect from your party, such as, “It’s just a small gathering to meet our new neighbors. Feel free to drop by.”
Most people are available between 10 and 2 on Saturday mornings, or between 5 and 6 on weekday evenings. Drop your invitations off during one of these times.
Keep an eye out. If you have not yet introduced yourself and see your neighbor outside working on the lawn, take advantage of the opportunity to say hello.

, You don’t want to make your new neighbors feel as though they are hoodwinked into attending your party. Create a casual atmosphere as you invite them, and in the written invitations. This will allow them to feel a bit more freedom in their decision to come to your affair or stay home.


The easiest way to create a low-pressure party is to create it as more of an open house. In an open house, guests are free to drop by a leave anytime within the allotted time period, without the pressure to arrive at a certain time, stay the duration of the party, and leave.

, An informal event such as this one necessitates informal dining options. Rather than a four-course meal, or even a sit-down meal, have finger foods and a few drink options available for your neighbors. This is another instance when you can invite a potluck-style mix of food. When you deliver your invitations, you can say something like, “Feel free to bring your favorite dish or snack.” If you go this route, don’t count entirely on your neighbors providing food--instead, treat any neighbor’s offerings as a pleasant surprise.

, Your neighbors will most likely have children who may be bored by an adult party. Consider having a few small game stations at your party. You can set up a table with board games outside, or you can use traditionally outdoor games such as horseshoes and cornhole. Whatever games you decide on, make sure you invite your guests to play them and demonstrate by playing them, yourself., Although the purpose of your party is to get to know your neighbors, your neighbors will likely want to get to know you, too. Be prepared to not only make small talk, but to also answer questions about where you come from, where you work, what you like to do, etc. Provide them with any information you feel safe and comfortable indulging.Be gracious if neighbors ask too many questions. In some situations, you may have to politely decline an answer, or steer the conversation in another direction. If this is the case, remember to be kind; after all, you will be living in close proximity with the people at your party.

Make a plan to pick up the container.",How to Buy a Freight Container," Choose your container based on how you will use it. Pick a refrigerated container (also called a “reefer”) to ship and store anything perishable. Choose a dry container for shipping or transporting dry goods or for a mobile office or home. Select a tank container for liquids, like oil or chemicals.Get a flat rack container for heavy machinery or for construction materials.
Choose a top loading container for cargo like logs, machinery, and oversized goods that need to be loaded from the top.
Buy a ventilated container for cargo that needs ventilation, like coffee beans, onions, and potatoes.;
, Base your decision about a new or used container on cost. You’ll spend more on a new container. You can easily find used containers that show little wear or damage because they are made from heavy-gauge steel.


Look for used containers from countries with high import-export ratios, like the United States. These countries often have surpluses of used containers.
Be aware that a used container will have common problems like some dents and rusting.

, Choose your container’s size based on the freight you will transport or its overall purpose. Freight containers are produced in standard sizes according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) specifications. Nearly all containers are 8 ft (2.4 m) wide by 8 ft (2.4 m) high with lengths of either 20 ft (6 m), 40 ft (12 m), or 53 ft (16 m). Note that interior dimensions may vary between manufacturers.Account for the fact that reefers will have less interior space because they also have refrigeration and ventilation units inside.

, Look for a dealer through the Intermodal Steel Building Units (ISBU) Association. Members of the ISBU have a vetted business history and are certified. Consult with one or several members to find the container you need. Verify the seller will inspect the container for you and send you photos., Visit your local port and consult with the freight container dealers there. Ask for their bona fides and references before you start working with them. Clearly explain what you are looking for and your price range once you do begin working together.

, Try to find container warehouses if you are buying near a port. Check the credentials and business histories for warehouses before you buy from them. Warehouses will have stock immediately available with a wide selection for you to choose from and you can negotiate prices at the warehouse., Do a search engine query to find companies that sell freight containers online. Check eBay for sales from reputable companies. Look for an online seller who posts detailed photos. Ask for the same level of information about the seller and the container that you would request from an ISBU member or a seller at your local port.

, Request photos and details about the condition of a used container if you are buying it remotely. Specify that you want high quality photos of all sides of the container inside and out. Also ask for photos of the top and bottom, floor and ceiling, and doors. Ask for a written or oral report on the condition of the container.

, If you can see the container in person before you buy it, examine it thoroughly. Check the top and bottom, floor and ceiling, and doors. Look for corrosion, excessive warping, holes, damaged door seals, and other major problems. Also smell the container for mold or toxic smells.Be prepared to remove excess mold.
Also be ready to seal or remove any wooden flooring that might have toxic residue.

, Check that you can open the doors. Dents or rust can make the doors of a used container difficult or impossible to open. Take a look at the hinges and make sure they aren’t preventing the doors from swinging properly because they are rusted or out of line.


Examine the doors in the photos if you cannot access the container in person before buying it.
Ask the seller to include a description of the doors in their report to you.

, Make sure the locking gear is rust-free. Also check that its location is suitable for your needs. A low locking gear works well when the container is mounted on a trailer. Opt for a high locking gear if you will be using the container at ground level, you should opt for a high locking gear., Go inside the container and look for any sunshine that comes through holes or cracks - these indicate the container is not watertight. Ask a remote seller to demonstrate this to you by photographing the container's roof from the inside on a sunny day. Any holes or cracks will show clearly in the photo.

, Compare the seller’s price to prices from other sellers. Check the web to compare costs for containers similar in size and condition to the one you are buying. Try to negotiate a better price if you see similar containers similar that are selling for less.


Factor in the condition of the container when determining or negotiating a good price. Used containers will typically be priced according to their condition.

, Determine that the container you want to buy is not owned by a shipping company when you buy it from any source. Write down the container number and call the company that should be listed on the side of the container.

, Ask the seller if they will deliver the container and how much delivery will cost. Find out if they will deliver by tilt-bed trailer, which allows you to position the container where you want it, or by flatbed truck, which will require a forklift or crane to unload the container. Be aware that international shipping companies will typically include delivery for a significantly higher price.Inquire if you will need to rent a forklift or crane if the seller will deliver by flatbed truck. Also find out if you’ll need a license to operate either piece of equipment.
Try to buy from a local company if you want to avoid high delivery costs.

, Be prepared to rent a flatbed or tilt-bed truck to pick up the container if the seller will not deliver it. Find out if you’ll need a license to rent the truck. Arrange for a forklift or crane to lift the container out of a flatbed truck. Also look into required licenses for operating that equipment.

Buy moving supplies at your local department store or office supply store.,
Consider buying used boxes.,
Look for free moving boxes.",How to Buy Moving Supplies," Check out your local U-Haul or Budget Truck Rental location. They sell boxes and other moving supplies for less money than you would pay at an office supply store or department store. Buying in bulk will often reduce your price even further.


Negotiate the inclusion of a set number of boxes and other moving supplies into your total rental price if you are renting a moving truck or van.
Check and see if any unused boxes can be returned. U-Haul will allow you to return any unused boxes for a full refund at any U-Haul location. Provide your receipt and return the boxes you did not use. Ask other companies if they will match that offer.
Buy moving supplies online from these rental companies if you do not have a location in your immediate area. Some of them will offer free shipping on products if you spend a certain amount of money.;
, Websites such as boxesdelivered.com and directmovingboxes.com offer packaging supplies and moving boxes that are often less expensive than movers or retail stores. There is often free shipping on orders that reach a minimum total.

, If you have all of the boxes you need for your move, and simply need to grab some last minute packing items such as markers or packing tape, check out your local Walmart, Staples or other chain retailer. You can also find moving supplies at drugstores such as CVS or Walgreens.

, Online sites such as Boomerang Boxes will sell you moving boxes that have already been used, but are in good condition. If the boxes hold up during your move, you can sell them back to the site.

, While people and stores will be unwilling to give away moving supplies such as tape, packaging, markers, and other items that can be used for other purposes, they might be willing to give you their used boxes.


Check with local grocery stores and other retailers to see if they will let you take the boxes that their deliveries arrive in.

Estimate how many boxes you will need.,
Shop online for packing boxes.,
Buy boxes at an office supply store.,
See if packing boxes are available at a local self-storage facility.,
Buy boxes at another large retailer.,
Look for boxes on online classifieds sites.",How to Buy Boxes for Packing," When looking through your things, keep in mind the density of each type of item. Books are very dense, for example, and should be packed into small boxes to avoid weighing down the boxes. Bulky, less dense items like linens and pillows will need to be placed in larger boxes. After deciding on the appropriate box size for each item, you can get a rough idea of how many boxes you'll need.;
, If you plan far enough ahead, this is one of the best options for buying cardboard boxes. Specialty packing and shipping retailers, such as Uline, sell boxes in innumerable shapes, sizes, and thicknesses. While there are usually minimum quantities specified by retailers like this, they are very low for an average move.


One benefit of shopping online is that these retailers often offer moving kits. These kits consist of a large assortment of boxes specifically chosen to accommodate a move of a given size.
Another benefit of buying boxes online is the ability to buy specially shaped boxes. Irregularly shaped or fragile items like floor lamps, guitars, and televisions can be packed into boxes specially designed to fit them well.

, If you are buying boxes on shorter notice or need smaller quantities, you can purchase them at an office supply store. Most stores will have a sufficient variety of sizes to accommodate general packing needs, but you may not be able to purchase in large quantities. You can also easily purchase packing supplies like tape and padding at the same time.

, Many self-storage companies will sell packing and moving supplies, including a variety of cardboard boxes. You can visit the facilities themselves or check the company's website for details.

, If going to an office supply store or storage facility is not convenient, you can look for boxes at large, general merchandise retailers. Stores like Target and Walmart will have a limited selection of boxes that may meet your packing needs.

, Websites like Craigslist and Freecycle are another good place to look for packing boxes. These sites will allow you to post your own ""wanted"" ad in addition to browsing for listings of cardboard boxes. While using these services will offer you the least amount of control over the size and quantity of boxes, they will generally be cheaper than other options.

Since the population is smaller and a bit more intimate, it might seem like everyone knows each other—and that everyone knows everyone else’s secrets, too. Avoid involving yourself in these kinds of conversations.


When talking to anyone about someone else in town, ask yourself if you are about to say something you would be okay saying directly to the subject. If it’s judgmental or private, try to keep it to yourself.If the conversation shifts into gossip, try to move it to something else without being rude. Offer up some good news, or ask some questions of the people you’re speaking with. Keeping the conversation focused on the people present in it can be helpful for avoiding gossip.;
, You might find that some of the new people you meet also relocated from a larger city. These people might be especially helpful when it comes to learning the ins and outs of small town life, particularly since they went through the same transition.


Try social networks as a way to find people with common interests in your new town. Don’t lose hope if you don’t find a new best friend immediately; relationships might take a little bit longer to forge in a smaller town where everyone knows everyone else. You may have to work a bit harder to be let in and trusted., If you expect your life to be exactly the same as it was, just on a smaller scale, you will end up disappointed. You might have to shop at a local grocer rather than the big retailer you’re used to. Or, you might not have a huge group of people your age that you do everything with. Understand that downsizing to a small town will mean some aspects of your everyday life will change.If you’re used to noisy, crowded clubs and a vibrant nightlife in the big city, you may have to adjust to more low-key, laid back evenings when you move to a small town. Try finding new things to do on weekend nights rather than being upset that you can’t keep doing what you’re used to.

, Regardless of what you may hear from locals or even read online about the town and the people in it, be sure to make your own judgements and decide for yourself how you feel about your new community.


Though small town gossip and cliques are still prevalent, the new generation has taken to voicing their negative opinions and gossip on internet forums. Rather than buying into what anonymous citizens have posted, get to know people and places for yourself., The pace of small town life is generally slower than in the big city. This might mean that there will be less going on in town—or even that the contractor you need to help fix a problem in your house won’t be able to come out right away. Learn to be more patient and focus less on instant gratification.You may have to take the initiative to make things happen a bit more in a small town. If you want something fun to do, or to get together with new friends, be the first one to make the phone call or to organize an event.

, It might seem intimidating to walk right up and knock on a stranger’s front door, but your neighbor might be thinking the same thing, so be the one to make the first move. Or, if you see your neighbor outside, make it a point to say hello and introduce yourself.


In small towns, people are usually very tightly knit, and it might seem difficult to wedge yourself into existing relationships and cliques. But, by going out of your way to make the first move and give your new neighbors a good impression, you might find that people are more receptive to including you.Make sure you come off as approachable. Try going for walks in the neighborhood, and avoid talking on the phone, texting, or keeping your earbuds in as you go about your business. If you look open to talking, more people might be prone to say hello or start a conversation.Don’t feel obligated to bring your new neighbors a gift when you go to introduce yourself. Instead, just use your move as a way to start the conversation. You could go next door and apologize for any noise or inconvenience your move-in may have caused, and then use that as a way to ask them questions and get to know them a little better. They’ll appreciate your consideration., Relocating from a big city to a small town is a big change. Many aspects of your daily life will be very different, from getting groceries to your morning commute. If you try to look at the experiences separately rather than comparing them to one another, you might be able to better appreciate the differences and changes.


For example, rather than missing the hustle and bustle that used to come with your morning commute, take a moment to appreciate how much easier and relaxed your new small-town commute is.Avoid thinking in terms of what is missing. Instead, think in terms of what is new and present. If you miss the view of a city skyline, maybe you can instead appreciate the view of hills and mountains, or whatever type of landscape your new small town offers., Just because you have left the city doesn’t mean you have to leave everything about it behind. There are ways to incorporate big city elements into your small town just by bringing them into your home.


Use the city as your design inspiration in your new home. Think about the things you liked most about the big city, or the things that first come to mind when you think of it—traffic, noise, bright lights and colors. Bring these elements into your home with decoration, artwork, and accents.Look in thrift stores and antique shops for old road signs or traffic lights to use as decorations. Hang a photo or painting of a city skyline on a wall in your house. Use photos of your old home to create a photo collage of memories to look at when you miss the city.

, Even though life in a small town is a lot different from life in a big city, there are plenty of things about small town life to admire and enjoy. From new landscapes to nicer people, try your best to acknowledge the things you like about your small town.


Living outside of a big city allows you to get closer to nature. If you’re a parent, you will be able to raise your kids to enjoy nature and wildlife, rather than have them glued to electronics or immersed in advertisements and overwhelming stimulation.Use your new location as a way to find new hobbies and things to do. Whether you’re single, married, have kids, or don’t have kids, there will be new opportunities for you to try new things that you may not have been able to experience while living in the city.

, The best way to feel more at home is to familiarize yourself with your new surroundings. Take in all the sights. Map your way to the local grocery store, coffee shop, or park. Learn your way around by exploring rather than relying on a GPS.You can also take a walk around the neighborhood rather than driving. In small towns, things might not be as close together as they are in a big city, but taking a walk can be a relaxing way to see what’s close to your house.
If you have children, look for local playgrounds, the library, and the schools. Life for a child in a smaller town can be especially rewarding, since it usually has a lot more space for outdoor play than you might find in an urban setting.

, Traditions and mannerisms in a big city can be very different from those in a small town. From social etiquette to transportation to grocery shopping, you might find that you have to adjust your former behavior to match the new town you’re in.In smaller towns, you might find that people are less prone to just stare at the ground and ignore everyone as they go about their day. People might be more trusting and open, and will want to interact with you more than strangers in a big city might.
Crime is sometimes lower in smaller towns, due to the close-knit nature of many small towns. There is less of a sense of anonymity. People might even leave their doors unlocked. It might even feel like everyone seems to know each other.

, As with any kind of move, you will be leaving behind some things you have grown to love and are accustomed to. For example, you may have gotten your morning coffee at the same busy shop every morning in the city, so now you will have to find a new shop to patronize.


The locals will be your best source of information on the town. They live there, and they know what spots are great. Try patronizing local establishments like farmers markets, restaurants, and shops.Small towns are often full of independently owned shops and restaurants. Rather than sticking to familiar franchises, branch out and try something new., When you’re trying to learn how to live and behave in your new small town, looking around you is the first step. Take mental note of how other people talk to you and interact with you. Notice which shops and restaurants have the biggest crowds.


Just like you learned your habits and behaviors in your previous city, you can learn the same things the same way in a small town. A key to avoiding that initial anxiety is to recognize that other people aren’t as concerned about your behavior as you are. Relax and observe others, and respond accordingly., People in smaller towns tend to value volunteerism a bit more, and you might find that there are a good number of opportunities to help out. Check the local recreation center or library for a calendar or list of clubs and meetings. Find something that interests you and join up! You will meet new people and get to know your town.


If you are a parent, join the parent teacher organization at your child’s school. You will meet other parents and immediately have something in common. You can also engage your kids in team sports or extracurricular activities to help them meet more people. This can help your children (and you!) adjust a bit more smoothly.Sign up to volunteer. People in small towns often have values that center around community involvement and family. Volunteering at a food drive, soup kitchen, or event can connect you with other people while also showing the people in your new town that you share their values.

, Visit the Chamber of Commerce in your new town to get a schedule of meetings, and also to get information on local services and businesses. Becoming involved in the ins and outs of your town will really help you feel more familiar with it.Not only will you meet other people in your town at these events, you will also have a chance to hear what is important to them in regards to the way the town functions and what happens within it.

, Reading the local paper every day will give you a sense of what’s going on in your town. Newspapers also often have calendars of upcoming events, as well as advertisements for local businesses, restaurants, and shops.


People in small towns often care about different things than people in larger cities. Reading the paper will give you an idea of what people in your town care about, and it will offer some talking points you could bring up when meeting new people in the town."

Plan to pack less-frequently used items first.",How to Plan a Move,"


Even if you have very little time, a few minutes spent planning and organizing the basics can help you make the best use of the time you do have.
If you have more time, you can plan more carefully and possibly save money and time down the road.;
, Moving across town may be something you can do yourself, using a rented truck for the largest items. Moving longer distances or moving to a new country may require that you ship items with a mover. Indeed, the farther the distance, the better off you are having reputable professionals take care of everything, including your pets.


For overseas moves, remember there will be such issues as customs and bio-security clearances, appropriate shipping methods, and storage issues on arrival.

, Will you hire somebody to move your belongings or rent a truck and do the job yourself? Do you have money saved up? Do you still have time to set aside the money you will need? Will an employer cover part of the cost of relocating?


If your employer is assisting you, make sure that everything is in writing, including any variations agreed upon verbally or otherwise. Things do go wrong, and you need the written confirmations to ensure that you get reimbursed appropriately.
Written records are also vital when dealing with professional movers. Be sure that you get a signed-off contract, that you have read all the fine print, and that you have full inventory lists checked and signed off by both you and the removal company.

, If your lease or purchase agreement(s) allow, get access to your new residence before you must give up your old one. Even a couple of days will spare you the stress and rush of an overnight move, or the hassle of moving into and out of a storage facility. A time overlap can also help in case of any delays with closing on the purchase of a home.


If you must move via a storage unit or if your dates do not overlap, see if there is a service in your area that will deliver and move storage containers for you so that you do not have to handle your belongings twice. The more moves you have to make in-between arriving at your destination, the higher the stress levels become and the more frustrated you are likely to feel.
If the move came as a surprise, such as if a landlord decided not to renew a lease or you have been posted overseas, you should have at least some minimum amount of notice in which to pack and seek new premises. In this case, your first priority should be to secure new lodgings, but you may still want to multitask the search for a new place with beginning to pack and sort your stuff, otherwise you might find yourself running out time.
Too much overlap can be costly. Don't pay double rent for longer than you need to. Seek the garages of friends and family before paying for storage options if possible.

, This is a personal choice, of course, but anything you can part with is something you don't have to move and moving is always a great time to be brutal with things you don't need or use. Keep in mind that you will have to balance the time spent to sort your belongings with the monetary cost and effort required to pack and move them.


If you move frequently, try to keep a minimum of basic belongings.
If you're downsizing with the move, you will have no choice but to remove things from your life. This can add to the stress initially but the resulting lower level of possessions is often a huge release for your new way of living.

, One alternative to taking that old sofa-bed with you is to sell it or give it away to someone else before you leave.


If you have expensive antiques or furniture consider an auction or estate sale.
Craigslist, Freecycle, and the like are excellent resources for selling and giving items away. In some places you can leave items on the curb and they'll disappear of their own accord in no time (check with municipal regulations though).
Consider having a garage sale.
Phone local charities to see what used items they can accept. Many can send a truck to pick up items you do not wish to move.
Many towns now have recycling centers so that you can have your items resold for the benefit of the community rather than simply dumping them to be treated as garbage.

, If all you have to do is haul stuff by the armload out to the apartment dumpster, there may be nothing to plan. On the other hand, if you will be shredding documents, making a run to the dump, buying extra trash tags, or hiring a hauling company, plan for these activities as soon as you can. Having a dumpster that is easily accessible during your move can make your job much easier., If you have time before the move, you may want to run through the usable foods in your pantry and freezer. If you do not have time, or if there are items remaining that you do not have time to move, see about donating the nonperishable stuff to a food pantry. You might also give usable items to friends and neighbors.


If moving overseas, carting food and beverages with you is rarely an option. Give away what you can, from spices to chocolate stashes. Investigate the rules about the carrying and acceptance of such items as alcohol if you wish to take your special wine cellar overseas with you. There can be a lot of strict rules surrounding food and alcohol importation, depending on the country; most countries do not let you move alcohol.

, Even if moving day is months away, start now to get the help you will need. The budget option is to call in favors from family and friends. Otherwise, look around for someone you can pay to help with packing and moving. Get recommendations from friends or read ratings if you have the time.


One thing friends can be a huge help with is meals. Once you start packing away your kitchen equipment, meals become problematic, so accept all offers for good food from others.
Friends can also be great babysitters for kids and pets, who can often get underfoot or increase your stress levels when you're worrying about where they are.
On the day of the move, strip all the beds, including the mattress pads, and gather the used towels. Get a neighbor to wash, dry, and fold everything, then pack all together in one box for immediate use in the new place.

, If you and your friends can move the sofa, fine. But if you have anything especially large, heavy, or fragile to move (such as a piano), you may need specialized help.


When moving long distances, ask the removal company about their wrapping and packaging techniques, as well as their policies with respect to breakages.
If asking others to remove valuable items, get references from people who have used their services and been satisfied with them.

, When you move, you should inform government agencies, institutions with which you do business, utilities, and so on. Make this list as soon as you know you will move, and continue to update it as monthly bills and statements remind you of whom you should inform.

In some countries, the post office offers a standard form with a list of names that you can check and they will advise the most obvious companies and agencies that you have moved. Inquire at your local post office for more information.
Consider mail forwarding for a while. Although this can cost money, it is better than having your mail go astray until you've caught up with all the address changes.
If you cannot forward your mail to a foreign country ask a trustworthy friend, or family if you can forward it to them. They can hold the important mail and throw away the unimportant.
Consider opening a joint account with a family member or friend that you can access online. This way if you need bills paid you can transfer funds and have them pay with them.

, If the new place must be cleaned or repaired before you move in, plan overlapping time or time with your belongings in storage to complete these tasks. If you must clean or repair the home you are leaving (such as to recoup a cleaning deposit or to leave it respectable for the buyers), plan that time, as well. Remember that cleaning is generally easiest and most effective in an empty residence.


If you have purchased a new home, inform the real estate agent that you would like a time set aside for a cleaning company to assess the cost of cleaning before settlement is complete, if possible. This allows you to set up the cleaning well in advance and also encourages the seller to be more prudent in cleaning out their stuff because you'll be aware of what needs to be cleaned and can raise particular concerns. It is demoralizing to move into a new home with the old grime and junk of the previous owner still there.

, If you will be renting a truck, using a shipping or moving company, then reserve your time as soon as you know that you will need it. In some areas and at some times of year (such as college towns at the end of the school year), the demand may be very high and you might have to wait longer than intended for a free spot., Boxes, newspaper, packing tape, and markers are the basics. Do you also need carts or dollies, any special carrying cases, or anything else?


Some companies sell quality moving boxes in bulk. This might be a good deal considering the boxes will be made for carrying items intended for household removal and won't be flimsy or strangely shaped as supermarket boxes can be.
Labels such as ""fragile"", ""this way up"", and explaining the contents and room, etc., can be made up on your home computer with ease. Just be sure to tape them on securely.
Check Craigslist or Freecycle if it is active in your area and time permits. You may find moving boxes and packing materials that others have just emptied.

, If you can, label or mark each box with where you want it to go rather than where it came from. (Often, this may be the same, since items coming out of the kitchen probably will go back into the kitchen.), These are the items you will keep out or keep separate so that you have the most essential items at hand when you first arrive. These items might go in a specially labeled box or in suitcases. You will know best which items to pack for yourself, but remember to include medications, eyeglasses, wallets and ID, plus a few changes of clothes. If pets will move with you, include the basics you need to care for them, as well.


It's a good idea to pack one box with a teakettle, a small pot, some teabags/coffee/cookies, some cutlery, a few plates, a toaster, some hand towels and liquid soap, etc. for those much-needed things when you first arrive. This will save you from rummaging around for basics and allow you to get on with the business of unpacking methodically.

, Especially if you have plenty of time to pack, start early, packing things like books and clothing that is out of season. You will unpack in approximately the reverse order."

Make sure you purchase good quality packing materials and strong moving boxes or cartons; it may be wise to consult a professional for recommendations. Also, consider acquiring:


Padding supplies
Bubble wraps
Wrapping sheets
Newspapers, blank newsprint paper
Scissors
Heavy duty packaging tape
Labeling stickers
Marking pens;
, Include in it your moving truck reservation, moving helper payment codes (if applicable), pet veterinarian records (again, if applicable), cash for movers tips, your hotel reservation, contact information for important people (realtor or property owner), and any important documents you could need before you have the chance to unpack.


Keep this file in a safe place, such as in your purse or personal bag, where you will not accidentally pack it in a box. It should also be in a place where it won't get buried in a mess that may develop.

, Include a personal-sized bar of soap, new toothbrush and toothpaste, towel and washcloth, disposable razor if needed, some ""relaxing"" clothes (sweats or something similar) and two complete changes of clothes, and anything else you know each person will need during the first few days (while everything else is in boxes). This way everything they'll need is easily attainable.


Keep these boxes or suitcases in a safe place where they will not be mixed in with everything else, perhaps in the car or even farther away (work or a neighbor's house). Bring them with you in the car or however you are traveling.

, Instead of buying feet and feet of bubble wrap or handfuls and handfuls of packing peanuts, turn to your clothes to provide that padding. Not only does it save you money, but you have to pack the clothes anyway, so it’s really two birds with one stone. Clothes are often more malleable than paper and bubble wrap, anyway.


As for things like glassware, wrap each one in a sock. It’s almost like that’s what the socks were truly meant for. If they clink against each other, they'll be fine.

, Is there anything you have set up that took you forever to get just right and you’re totally loathing the moment you have to disassemble it? Then snap a photo of it for quick reference later.


You may also want to snap a photo for frame arrangements and decorative set-ups, too. Not to mention the nostalgia and memories, of course.

, You’ll want a nice, wide open space where you can drag and drop all your stuff and then expedite the packing process. This is where you’ll have your boxes, your packing materials, and your pens, tape, and labels. This is your I’m-getting-stuff-done room.


As you pack each box and seal it up, put a number on it, in addition to the room label and contents. This way, if you have X number of boxes, you’ll know when one is missing, in addition to being able to tell the movers just how many boxes you have.

, Wrap each individual item properly with enough layers of wrapping sheets, bubble wrap, or clothes. Place items inside a box with extreme care in the best position possible to avoid damages. Heavier items should be placed on the bottom and lighter items should be placed on the top inside the boxes. Get as many items as possible in each box to cut down on the number of boxes you’ll need.


Pack heavy items such as books, toys, etc. in small boxes. However, be conscious of not over packing boxes until they are bulky and may break.
Pack fragile or breakable items with extra care and attention. If required, use more layers of wrapping sheets or bubble wraps to wrap such items. Place saran wrap between bottles and caps to prevent leaking. Consider putting cotton between fragile cosmetics, too.
Use wadded newspapers or crushed papers to fill empty spaces of boxes or cartons.

, This makes unpacking easier once you get where you are going. Start packing one room at a time, packing smaller items first to get them out of the way. Carefully mark and tape each box so you can find everything when you unpack.


This makes it easier for the movers, too. If they're courteous and not on a time crunch, they'll likely take each labeled box and put it in its corresponding room.

, Place all hardware in double-thick Ziploc bags, according to contents and room. Keep all bags in one box with the proper tools – allen wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, etc. This will make it easier to put everything back together when you have moved in.


Make sure you keep the box of hardware and tools in a central place where everyone can find it. This will make re-assembling much easier. Place in it the small things like video ear plugs, remote controls, boxes of nails and things you will need immediately after moving in.

, Toss away junk and only box things that you use. Use your kitchen food storage containers for all loose things you find as you empty drawers from the kitchen, desks, or table drawers throughout the house. Label boxes according to contents and rooms they belong in then securely close or tape them. Use various sized bags for the same purpose. Add a sticky note inside each bag noting the contents like ""stereo cables"" and ""pens and pencils.” Place all containers and bags inside a larger box labeled appropriately with room and content.


Plates should be stacked vertically, like records. Don’t forget to look in the dishwasher!
Do you need anything to stay intact, like necklaces (so they don't get tangled)? Try saran wrap or stretch wrap over them as is and then pack them.

, This most probably will include the items which you have been using until the date of the move. Think about small handy items you might want access to before you unpack all boxes. It may also be useful to add items such as dish soap, a sponge, a roll of paper towels, Kleenex, a couple pens, scissors, plastic/paper plates/forks, a bottle opener, bath towels for each family member, one pot, one pan, one plastic stirring utensil, an extra box cutter, etc.


Keep in mind that people will need to wash their hands, eat, and shower long before you are done unpacking on the other end of the move. Having this box will make that simple.
Also, toss in a sugary treat such as Lifesavers or hard candies in case anyone gets hungry or low blood sugar on move-in day. This is a good way to keep the bad moods at bay.

, Try to keep them stacked in the rooms that you have finished packing. Keep all power strips and extension cords and grounded adapters in one specific box; they will be much easier to find later.


Clearly label the hardware box and the extension cord box. Consider spray-painting both boxes bright yellow or red.
Place all the screws or bolts back into an item after it has been taken apart. This way, you can connect the bed or put the lampshade back on immediately instead of searching for them.

, Do you know where each one is? Are any in need of any extra tape job? Do you have more than you thought you might and need to inform the movers that you'll need a bigger truck?


Which ones are fragile and which ones are sturdy? Are there any that you want to handle yourself, just in case? You may wish to set a few aside so you know where they're at at all times.

, Place any last minute items together in one room. Remember: when the truck has been filled, and the movers tell you that they have everything, checking out each room to make sure that nothing has been left behind is your responsibility. When you are certain that each room is clean, then it is time to shut the door and leave!

, Pro movers specialize in getting everything safely and efficiently from one house to the other. The do not specialize in separating your good china from the bad, not rounding up all of the dirty laundry on the floor. They will ask you to be cleaned and organized before they arrive. Good ideas include;


Grouping similar small items in boxes (books, dishes, etc.)
Clearly designating valuable and fragile goods
Throwing out and purging excess stuff in advance.
Labeling boxes with final locations., Good movers are methodical. They keep everything in similar places, packing you up room by room. While they may mix things up to make sure everything fits well, they are practiced in the most convenient way to get things in and out of their truck. Expect them to work much more efficiently than you might on your own.

, One of the chief benefits of a moving team is that they know how to handle the bunk beds stuck in the kids' room. Professionals will take down the furniture into the most convenient, easily transported parts, pad the pieces safely, and put everything back together when you arrive.


Since most movers are paid hourly, feel free to assemble or break down furniture by yourself if you feel confident in your abilities. You'll save some money., Things break when they are allowed to move around in the truck, bouncing off other objects. A good mover understands that packing tightly isn't just about saving space, it is about a snug, tight fit. They will:


Use packing peanuts to fill empty space.
Wrap furniture and large pieces in heavy blankets to prevent sliding or moving.
Group square and rectangular objects, which can be jammed close together, in the same box., A professional makes their living off of transporting your things and has the wherewithal and knowledge needed to prevent accidents. That said, in the case that something does happen, professional movers have the responsibility to pay you back for any damages incurred.


Hiring a professional insures the past possible pack job, and then insures you further if something bad happens.
Always ask about the contract before signing-- some smaller companies may try to get out of responsibility for damages if you aren't careful. You may need to pay for warranty.

, A professional mover should keep a log of every box and item, allowing them to prove that they got everything safely to your new location. This sort of double-checking is crucial, especially on big or complicated (multi-truck, cross-country, etc.) moves.


If the moving company does not inventory your items, you should.

, This can vary, but it is a good baseline when thinking about rates and how many movers you need. It takes two movers roughly 5 hours to completely pack a 1,000sq foot house (500ft per mover). Thus:


With 4 movers, a 3,000ft house would like 13 hours.
With 3 movers, a 2,000ft house would take 10-12 hours.
With 6 movers, a 4,000ft+ house would take 15 hours or more., Maybe you want to save money and just have someone help with the heavy lifting. You can pre-pack the boxes. Maybe you want someone to do everything for you with a bit of guidance. You can pay for the movers to wrap and protect all your goods. Professionals are there to serve you, and will do the work that you need to be done. Expect a professional mover to ask a lot of questions about your exact needs.Movers will appreciate your direction and guidance as long as it saves things from breaking or getting lost.

, The best way to get acclimated is to use resources such as Google Maps and Map-Quest to search the neighborhoods. Try to look for restaurants and grocery stores that are similar or the same to what you have now. The more familiar something as important as a grocery store is, the better you will feel.

, Have you decided if you are going to live on campus or off campus? Regardless of what decision you make, there are a lot of choice that go with it. If you are going to be living on campus, you have to think about living with other people, sharing all of your stuff, and especially sharing your personal space. If you decide that you are going to be living off campus, you must consider if you are again going to live with roommates, or if you are going to front the bill yourself. If you do live by yourself, it will be harder to adjust to the city if you are alone all the time.

, The biggest stress of moving to a large city is how it seems like you are spending money on things you never did before. Try to really make sure you budget your money. Don’t get caught up in spending because everyone else is.

, Getting a job in the city is actually easier than getting a job in your small town. In a small town, there is not that many jobs to come by, and usually you are in that job for many years. Now there is a really fast turnover rate for many places. The biggest place to go to find a part time job is the nearest mall.

, You have just moved to a place where there is public transportation. This can be very frightening if you’ve never experienced it before. Try it with a bunch of friends during the day if it’s your first time ever. It does get easier as your experience it more.


Your own car. You might not need your own car when you move to the city. Usually you have to drive quite a distance to get to the nearest store, but now they are all going to be in walking distance, or at least most of them are. And like it as said before, there is even public transportation to get you places. You can save a lot of money by not taking your car with you. You will lose out of coming home as often without a car though.

, As trivial as it seems, your clothing choice can actually be a big deal if you’re not used to it. Living in a small town, most people do not stay up on fashion as much. So get used to being slightly out of fashion at the start. But the good thing is that when you go home, you will now be the most fashionable person in your town!

, Something that was once regarded as annoying will now be cherished. You never realize how much you love and miss your family until you move away from them. You might be gone for a week, and it seems like forever. Going home is sometimes the most exciting part of your week! You will get to eat some great home cooked food, do free laundry, and sleep in your own bed. It’s a wonderful sensation.

, Making friends is quite possibly the hardest part about moving to a large city. At home, you knew the name of everyone in your school, possibly even their parents, grandparents, and other relative’s names. You have had the same teacher as all your siblings, and maybe even your parents. Now you move to a city and you might meet one person one day and never see them again. Try to be friendly and nice to everyone you meet, you never know when you are going to see them again, and if you do, it’s best to leave a good impression. To make more friends, be outgoing, go to places you wouldn’t normally go, eat foods you’ve never tried, and be adventurous. You will never make friends if you sit at home all the time; you have to put yourself out there, even if it makes you out of your comfort zone., The Internet is a great way to keep in contact with everyone, besides, they are probably going through the same problems you are going through. They are also going to be very interested in how you are doing too. They want to know what the experience is like for you. Maybe this a great opportunity to start a blog???

, Remember, you're here for a reason, which is building your future, don't let the big city temptations drag you down.

, And whatever you do, don’t worry. Life is a journey. This is your opportunity to try new things, experience stuff you never thought would happen, and really find out who you are. I bet you anything, you will not come back to your small town the same person you were when you left. You will have grown matured, and become the successful person you were meant to be. Never Ever forget your small town roots, they will help you years to come, even if it seems impossible now.

, Cherish your small town. They are disappearing slowly and surely. Take time to really look back and remember what it is like to grow up knowing everybody in your town from the janitor at you school to the town mayor on a first name basis. It’s truly something you will never find again.

Leave behind any relevant things that you'll be using if you're returning to this parent's house sometimes, and are not needed where you're headed. For example, if one parent has moved to Alaska and you're leaving Southern California, leave the warm weather wear for your return.;
, Moving from one parent to another parent's house means no bringing any of your borrowed jewelry or borrowed clothes from your mom or dad. If there is something of the sort you want to take, ask first.

, The might include souvenir cups, shoes lying around, magnets, books, etc. Decide whether or not you want to take these with you. If you're leaving this parent's house for good, it's probable you'll want them but if it's a case of moving between both places, then maybe some things can stay behind. Ask your parent to take good care of them in this case.

, This helps when you unpack everything, as it's easier to know what is in each one. Don't throw lots of different things into one box or you won't be able to find anything later.

, This might include stocking the pantry with the food items you like the most and finding clothing that suits the local climate, especially if you don't own any of the right sorts of clothing.


When clothes shopping be sure to only pick out things you absolutely love. New house means a new you right?
When grocery shopping, don't hesitate to tell which foods you like and don't like at all.

, If there is already furniture there, ask for your own soft furnishings and bedding choices, so that you can really make the new room your own.


Arrange all of your own items brought from your other house around the room, to make it your very own place.

, After all, you're going to be living with your parent for a while, so you might as well get comfortable. You can even trust your step-parent if needed.

, You don't want them to think of you as a stranger, so get to know them and spend time with them too.

, Then, you'll know what times to ask things, when they'll be home, when they're sleeping, when they're picking your sibling up from a sport, and so forth.

, Now, you don't have to sit them down and ask, ""What are your rules?"". This can be simple, just ask before doing things, and see whether they say yes, no, or are iffy about it. Ask for curfew before going out, and always tell them before leaving the house, even if it's just to take a walk.

, Ask if you can help with dinner, do the dishes, put away groceries (even if you don't know where they go at first), walk the dog, take out the trash, etc.

, Food, dishes, napkins, etc. If you're living there, you need to know where to grab something. (It even helps just to stare at the cabinets and refrigerator for a bit.)

, Going to a new school can be scary, especially when you're not the most social person. Don't worry though; they won't all shun you, and you can always contact your old friends.

, That way you're more prepared and won't be caught off guard if you get in trouble. It can be helpful to have an orientation tour before school starts; ask your parent to arrange this for you.


Walk in on sign-up day and take a stroll around so you know which classes are yours and which locker is yours and how to get to each in time.

, Whether it be family, friends that moved, or just someone you've met before so they can show you around and help at school. Even a friend of a friend or cousin can be a good way to start getting to know people, so ask people you do know if there is anyone they could put you in touch with.

, Get involved by joining sports, getting phone numbers, inviting people over, etc. Be friendly and pleasant to everyone.

, There's never a bad time for one. If possible, invite all your old friends over and your new ones so they can mix and you can create a bigger friend group. But if this isn't possible, invite your new friends over so that you can get to know one another better outside of the school context.

, It's simple, if you know the trick. The trick, is actually pretty easy. If you're reluctant about moving in with new parent, develop a new outlook about it. A new life, a time to start over. You'll get new clothes, furniture, experiences, and a new city. It's all exciting if you have the right mindset.

, Start out with how early you have to get up. Do you have to fight for the bathroom in the morning? Get up early. Do you need to get up for practice on weekends? make sure you know what times you can get everything done so you're not rushed before school. After school, immediately do your homework and chores so that you have time for other things. Leave a little break and free time. It'll put less stress and more normality into your night.

, Text your friends to come over, watch TV, even spend time with your siblings and/or step-siblings.

, They may want to go out, want you to babysit unexpectedly, or help with something.

, Then you have something to look forward to, and don't accidentally make plans with friends or anything of that sort.

, You moved in, but you can't just do anything you feel like. Don't hog the living room, invite too many friends over, be loud, or leave a mess for anyone to clean up. It'll take time before you know what you can and can't do within the new family structure.

, Never go into their rooms if they're not okay with it, never watch the show they hate when they're around, and don't do things without permission. The most common way to make your parents mad when moving in is thinking they're the parent that will let you do whatever you want and not care.

Gather materials.,
Prepare the cab.,
Disassemble your furniture.,
Pack books and bookcases to make the most of the space.,
Move all of your furniture out in front of the truck.,
Load the heaviest items and appliances into the truck first.,
Protect your remaining furniture.,
Move the longer items into the truck.,
Pack your boxes into the truck.,
Put in any remaining items.",How to Pack a Moving Truck," To pack your truck in the safest and most efficient way possible, you'll need a few extra items to help you move your heaviest items and to protect your most delicate belongings. You can get these supplies from a moving supply store or a hardware store. Here's what you'll need:


A dolly. This will help you move your heaviest furniture as well as your boxes.
Paper padding, plastic stretch wrap, or furniture pads. This will help keep your furniture free from damage.
Packing tape. This will hold the padding over your furniture together.
Straps. These will help your furniture stay together and will keep it from shifting.
A large tarp or plastic wrap. This should cover the floor of the truck to keep your furniture from getting dirty.;
, You should put the items you really need in the cab so you don't forget about them and end up packing them up in the back of the truck. You'll need to bring a toolkit so you can reassemble your furniture as soon as you need to, overnight items so you don't have to search for them, as well as the most fragile items that you don't want to put in the truck.


If you or someone who is helping you is also driving a car to your new home, you can also give your fragile items to that person.
Fragile items include valuable plates, anything made of glass, and even light bulbs from disassembled lamps.
Your overnight items should include enough for you to live with for a day without having to unpack. This will help you avoid an annoying situation where you've packed away your deodorant and have to buy a new one because you can't find it.
Put your computer and small electronic items, or even a television, in the cab, if they will fit. You can add these items later during the packing process.

, This will help make your furniture easier to pack and light enough to carry. Before your furniture leaves your house, it should be taken apart into manageable pieces. Not everything can be taken apart, of course, but taking apart a few key items will make moving much easier.Here's what you can do:Remove the cushions from your sofas.
Take apart your bed and your bed frames. Tape your bed frames together.
Take the bulbs out of your lamps and place them in a separate container or bag. The last thing you want is for glass to get crushed all over your truck.
If you have heavy dressers, take the drawers out and carry them to the truck individually. When you load the dresser back into the truck, you can put the drawers back in and even tape them shut.
Filing cabinets can be the heaviest item of all. Take out your drawers and carry them to the truck separately before you put them back in.
If you remove any screws or hardware from the furniture, put it in a bag and tape it to the furniture, or put a note in the bag that clearly says which piece of furniture it's from.
Take apart your bed rails or table legs, and roll them into large rugs or carpets.

, If you have a lot of books, and a lot of bookcases, go out and get specific boxes that will fit on the bookcases. That is a lot of wasted space otherwise, and regular boxes are usually too wide and too tall to fit on bookshelves. You can pack some books on the bookcases, but you must have a way to keep them from coming off the shelves. On higher shelves, it would be better to pack lighter items in the boxes. Since books are very heavy, even the standard U-Haul ""small"" box is too heavy for many people to carry. Smaller boxes of books will allow less strong people to carry the books.


You can get small and odd-sized boxes at local companies that recycle them from industry. All you'll need is the specific measurements of the shelves you wish to populate
The smaller boxes will also help you with the chaos of moving. After packing the boxes, they can be put on the shelves until you move; after you arrive at your new location, they can sit on the shelves until you are ready to pack them.

, Moving as much of your furniture out into the street as you can will help you see how much you're working with, and will make it easier for you to see which items are the heaviest.


Only do this if you don't annoy your neighbors or end up taking up too much space.
You can also load right from your house into the truck, but you'll have to keep out an eye for which items should go in first (heaviest to lightest).
Make sure you have a clear path between your home and the truck.

, You should have two people in the truck who will be the designated ""loaders,"" while the rest of the people will carry the furniture to the truck or hand it to them if it's light enough. Pack these items into the front of the truck to maximize your space and to keep the truck from dragging if the back is too heavy. If the truck drags, you could be in a dangerous driving situation, so it's best to avoid it.The heaviest items include your appliances, such as the stove, washing machine, fridge, and dishwasher.
If you're packing a fridge, don't forget to defrost it at least 1 to 2 days before your move.
Keep these items in their upright positions and distribute the heavy items along the back wall of the truck. If you have a washer and dryer, position them on the opposite side from the fridge.
Next, load large pieces of furniture, such as sofas, living room chairs, and entertainment units.
Remember that you'll be packing from floor to ceiling, with the heaviest items on the bottom. Pack 2–3 foot (0.6–0.9 m) tiers of items, and wrap a strap around the items when you're done with each layer to hold them together.

, Though some people like to wrap their furniture in advance, it's best to wrap the items as soon as you get them in a truck. When you move an item into the truck, you should put it on top of the paper padding, cover it in the padding, and then tape it down. Here are some extra tips for protecting your furniture:


For extra protection, after you wrap a mirror or painting, you can put it between your mattress and box spring, or surround it by cushions.
Wrap up your couch cushions and pillows.
Wrap your mattresses.
If you plan ahead, you probably have a lot of things that you need to move with you anyway that would make great protective pads in the truck. When packing your house, leave all blankets, sheets, towels and other linens unboxed and use them when packing.

, These will include your sofas, table-tops, headboards, long mirrors, and your box spring and mattress. Put them against the longest walls of the truck to save space and keep them upright. Secure these items to the side of the truck with ties if it has a place for them.


Your sofa, mattress, and box spring will provide cushion for other items.
Put dressers and desks against your mattresses so the drawers can have a cushion if they open.
Any item with drawers should be facing the truck walls so the drawers can't open too much.

, Choose boxes of similar size and strength so you can stack them on top of each other. Place the heaviest and largest boxes on the bottom, medium-weight boxes in the middle, and lighter items on top. You will be creating three layers of weight.


Make sure you have labeled the boxes to say which room they should go in.
Pack a layer of heavy, medium-sized, and light boxes, and repeat the process until the truck is mostly full.
Try to create tiers that have a similar height, so you can pack the boxes to create an even surface.
Move from the front to the back of the truck.
As you go along, place in items that are hard to stack in between crevices to save space. Items like cushions and strollers are great for this.

, Your goal should be to pack the truck as tightly as possible without squeezing the items together too tightly. Squeeze in any unwieldy items where you can, and place fragile items on top so they don't get crushed.


Try to fit together the remaining parts as if you were working on a jigsaw puzzle. Everything will be able to fit together if you arrange it the right way.
Place items that don't fit anywhere else in the front of the truck, such as grills.
If you rent a truck that is larger than you need and you do not fill the truck completely, you can minimize moving and jostling by leaving the empty space at the back of the truck and keeping the height of your packing low and even.

human or international rights violations
criminal record
health
financial reasons
misrepresentation
non-compliance with IRPA (Immigration Refugee Protection Act)
having an inadmissible family member;
, It is important to go through a legal channel to gain entry to Canada. Otherwise you will be breaking the law and you may be deported. There are several ways that you can apply to be a Canadian resident. These include:Express Entry for Skilled Workers. The skilled worker class is considered by many to be the most effective way to gain Canadian residency. People with at least 12 months of full time managerial, professional, or skilled trade work experience may apply under this category.When applying through this class, officials will consider your age, work experience, education, and the field in which you will be working.

Business Start-up or Investor. These types of visas are meant for individuals who are entrepreneurs, own their own businesses, or who are professional investors. Investors who wish to apply through the investor channel must have a net worth of at least $10 million Canadian Dollars or more.Provincial. Provincial class residency occurs when a specific Canadian province selects you to move to it. This form of residency is relatively rare.

Family Sponsored. In the family class, your family members who already live in Canada can agree to sponsor your immigration to the country.

Quebec-Selected. Quebec-selected immigration is similar to Provincial class residency, except it is the Provincial government that selects you on behalf of the Federal Government. It is designed for students, business people : including the Quebec VIP Investment visa Program , temporary workers, families, and refugees who only want to move to Quebec.

International Adoption. In the international adoption class, current Canadian citizens who have adopted a baby or child from another country can secure the child's Canadian residency.

Refugees. People who are fleeing their home countries for safety reasons may also apply for residency by completing a refugee application. Sponsorship to help with the cost of the application and relocating to Canada is also available.Caregivers. If you are coming to Canada for the purpose of caring for a Canadian resident or citizen, then you may be able to apply for a Caregiver visa.

Self-Employed. If you work for yourself, then you may be able to apply for a visa as a self-employed individual. Keep in mind that you may have to prove that you have an income of at least $40,000 per year and that you could continue to earn as much living in Canada., Choose the application that is most relevant to your situation to apply for your visa. For example, if you are self-employed and planning to move to Canada, then you would need to fill out a different application than someone who is planning to move to Canada as a caregiver for someone else.


Skilled workers can complete an Express Entry profile online if you want to speed up the process of moving to Canada. This profile includes information about yourself, your language skills, and your credentials. After you complete your Express Entry profile, you will also need to register with the Government of Canada’s Job Bank (unless you already have a job offer).If you are applying for a self-employed, start-up visa, Quebec-selected skilled worker, family sponsored visa, or a provincial visa, then you will have to mail in your application., The application fees can be quite high, especially if you will be requesting entry for a spouse and other dependents as well. For example, the application fee for an Express Entry application for an individual would be $550 Canadian dollars. However, if you are bringing a husband or wife and child as well, then the total application fee would be $1,250 Canadian dollars.


Make sure that you pay your application fee in full or your application may not be processed.

, Keep in mind that it can take a while to get a response on your application. Even if you apply using the Express Entry form, you may have to wait for up to six months to get a response.Therefore, make sure that you apply as soon as you know that you want to move to Canada. Don't wait until a month or a week before you want to go, get the application in right away.


If your application is denied, then you will have to reapply and you should only do so if your situation changes in a significant way. You cannot appeal the decision., When you move, you will need to have certain official documents with you in order to gain entry to Canada. You'll need:


A Canadian immigrant visa and Confirmation of Permanent Residence for each family member traveling with you
A valid passport or other travel document for each family member traveling with you
Two (2) copies of a detailed list of all the personal or household items you are bringing with you
Two (2) copies of a list of items that are arriving later and their money value

, You will need to secure a place to live before you make your move to Canada. Find a place to live that is well within your income level. Keep in mind that you will have many other costs associated with your move to Canada, so you will need to ensure that you have money left over each month after paying your rent.


If possible, visit a month or two before you move so that you can look at potential homes for yourself.
If you cannot find a permanent place to live before you leave, then you may want to consider staying in a hotel until you can secure a place to live., Although Canada offers free health insurance to residents and citizens, you will need to purchase private health insurance to ensure coverage for up to three months after you first arrive in Canada. The providers will vary depending on your province.


If you are a refugee coming to Canada, then you may be protected by the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP) and not need to purchase private insurance. All others will have to secure private health insurance until they receive a government health insurance card., Good communication skills will help you to thrive in your new home. If either English or French is not your first language, then you will need to invest some time and energy into improving your language skills. Look for a class that you can take on weekends or evenings to help you get a handle on the language.


In some provinces, French is more prominent than English. Find out what most people speak in the province you will be moving to.
If you already speak one of Canada’s two national languages (English or French), then you may want to consider learning the other language., If you gained entry to Canada without securing job ahead of time, then you may need to devote a large portion of your time and energy to finding a job after you make the move. Make sure that you are registered with the Canadian Government’s Job Bank and check it often for new postings.


New immigrants do face some obstacles when it comes to getting a job in Canada: your credentials may not be recognized, your language skills may not be sufficient, or you might need Canadian work experience.A Social Insurance Number can be obtained at a Service Canada Centre. Just be sure to take your primary documents with you. Even temporary residents can get one of these.

, If you choose to stay in Canada and want to enjoy the rights of being a Canadian citizen, this is the obvious next step. After all, that's why you moved in the first place, right?


After 4 years of residency in Canada, you can apply to be a legal citizen of this country. In addition to living in the country for 3 years, you must also be at least 18 years of age, be able to speak English or French, have an understanding of Canadian social protocols, and have passed a Canadian government and politics exam.
When these obligations are met, you will be granted legal Canadian citizenship. You will receive an invitation to attend a citizenship ceremony, where you will receive a certificate highlighting your Canadian citizenship.

Get to know your new neighborhood.",How to Move," First, you have to assess your stuff to have a sense of what you're taking with you on the move and what you're leaving behind. There could be a variety of reasons for leaving your stuff behind. Your new place could be smaller, you could be moving in with someone with nicer versions of your stuff, or you could just be ready to get rid of the old junk you don't need. Here's how you do it:


Assess the space in your new place. Get the dimensions of every room in your new home and then measure your furniture to have a better sense of what fits and what doesn't.
Sell your stuff on Craigslist. You should start doing this at least a few weeks in advance to make sure that people have enough time to pick up your stuff. If you have great photos and some useful stuff, it'll be pretty easy to sell your things, and you may be surprised by just how quickly people buy up your things. For this reason, you shouldn't post your stuff on Craigslist too far in advance, or you might just end up without a dining room table for a month.
Understand the challenge of selling your mattresses. You may have a mattress and box spring in amazing condition that you want to sell, but know that people are wary of buying a bed from a perfect stranger. Either prepare to set your price real cheap, or advertise with your friends, family, and people who actually know you.
Have a yard sale. This is a great way to get rid of a lot of your stuff in one fell swoop.
Donate your stuff. You may not like your old clothes or shoes, but a lot of people would benefit from them.
Have a moving party and put all the stuff you don't want in the corner of your room. You'll be surprised by how quickly your guests snatch them up.
Sell your old books to a used book store, or donate them to a library.
In the weeks leading up to your move, eat as much of the food in your fridge, freezer, and pantry as you can, so you can avoid heavy cans, or melting or messy food items.;
, Though packing your stuff will take a long time, as long as you're organized and have a good plan in advance, it shouldn't consume your life. You should start packing at least a few weeks in advance so you have enough time to pack everything, but not so far in advance that you're surrounded by clutter and start packing away the things you'll need. Here's what to do:


Get your cardboard boxes ready. You will need more cardboard boxes than you think. You can get them for free from your local grocery store, find them under ""free stuff"" on craigslist, get them from a friend who recently moved, or just buy them if you want to save time.
Label all of your boxes carefully. You should write where each box should go on the tops and on the sides of the boxes, so you'll know where the boxes should go even if they're stacked on top of each other.
Pack a box of essential items. You should do this on the morning or night before your move. The box should include bathroom necessities such as toothpaste, shampoo, soap, your shower rods and curtain, and towels, as well as any overnight essentials like your bedspread, blanket, pillows, and pajamas. Also, if you can't live without caffeine, pack away your coffee maker or tea and tea kettle.
Pack all the items that go in the same room in one box. Don't worry about separating your books from your notebooks, if they'll both go in your office. Just put everything that goes in the same part of your room in one box so you can unpack the stuff more easily.
Have a ""packing station"" in your house. Instead of cluttering each of your rooms with a few boxes, pick one place to keep all your packed items.
Keep your hardware in a prominent place. Make sure your toolbox is on-hand when you move so you start assembling your furniture again. You can either put it in your essentials box, or keep it in the cabin of your moving truck or your car.
Hang on to your essential paperwork. Hold on to any paperwork that is related to your old home, your new home, or your moving process. Don't pack it away with the other stuff that goes in your desk, or you won't be able to find it in a pinch.

, Whether your friends are heroically helping you move all of your boxes, or if they're just hanging out for moral support, you should let them know when you're moving well advance. Send them an email or give them a call asking for their help on the big moving day.


Don't forget to reward your friends for helping you. Though they're offering to help you out of the kindness of their hearts, you should still make sure to take them out to a restaurant after the move, or to order in beer and pizza.

, Call ahead to make sure you have heat and electricity in your new home, or your move will be off to a very unpleasant start.


Utilities include water / gas / electric (often bundled), telephone / TV / internet (also often bundled), home security, and refuse.
Services that you'll need to coordinate once you move in include address changes and anything tied to your address, for example insurance, banking, or car licenses and registration.
Places to locate include the nearest hospital, fire station, police station, village hall, country government, post office, park district, animal hospital, library, public transportation, and school., If you're tackling the move by yourself, then you'll need to arrange to pick up a moving truck on the morning of the move. Make this arrangement well in advance, or it may be tricky to rent a truck exactly when you want it for a reasonable price during a busy moving season.


Compare the prices of a few companies before making your decision.

, Get there early to avoid waiting in a line on a busy moving day.

, Packing your moving truck won't be a big challenge if you plan in advance and have the help of a few trusted friends when you do it. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you pack your moving truck:


Remember that you will need at least two people to handle things other than lifting and hauling. They will need to organize the things that need to be loaded by keeping the packed boxes close to the door easily accessible.
Disassemble your furniture. Take apart any lamps, tables with removable legs, bookshelves, and entertainment systems.
Protect your furniture. Wrap all of your items with packing paper and tape as you load them into the truck.
Load the heaviest items first, into the back of the truck. This includes your fridge, washer, dryer, and other appliances, as well as your heaviest boxes.
Load the heaviest boxes. Stack them like bricks to form layers of walls that fill the back of the truck. Use T-stacks to make the boxes more stable: make each vertical seam make a T with the horizontal layer below it, like bricks in a house. Avoid vertical pillars of similar sized boxes. To maximize space, it is essential to stack high, stable walls early on.
Next, load your longer items into the truck. This includes your bed and shelves. Lean them against the sides of the truck.
Pack your remaining boxes into the truck. Create three layers of boxes which includes the heaviest boxes on the bottom, the medium-sized boxes in the middle, and the lightest boxes on top. Once you're done with each layer, tape it together with packing tape.
Put in your remaining items. The trick is to make everything fit snugly together, but don't pack it so tight that it looks ready to explode.
When using the ramp of a box van, such as the vans pictured, make sure the ramp has been fitted into place: once you have fully extended the ramp from under the truck, you will find two prongs that will fit into slots on the lip of the van's cargo space. This will ensure that the ramp is flush with the lip, and make it a breeze to use the dolly. This step is often overlooked.
Make sure the dolly is one of the last things to get loaded, so you will have it as soon as you arrive at the new house.

, Carefully drive the truck to your new home. Be prepared to drive slower and more carefully than you would in a car. Driving a moving truck takes a big adjustment.


Remember to go slowly and stay calm, because the drive may be stressful.

, If at all possible, back the truck up to the new house so that the ramp will extend onto the porch. Use all of your crew as spotters to make sure you are clear of any obstacles. When you are close to the porch, extend the ramp and hook it in place, and have a crew member carry the opposite end. Most ramps will not latch properly unless the end is on the ground. Once you have the ramp set up, here's how you can unload your stuff:


Have a plan for where you're going to put the large items in each room. Do a walk through with the movers, and show them where the larger items go, such as the sofas, TV, cabinets, beds, dressers, night-stands, etc.
Choose where to put the boxes and small items in each room based on that. That way the boxes won't be in the way when the big furniture comes in. And you won't have to move the boxes again. You can put Post-it notes on the wall if necessary.

, You will have arranged whether you will do this the same day or the next morning.

, If you want to move with the help of a moving company, you will have to spend a lot more money for your move, but you will save yourself from the stress of having to move your boxes, drive a moving truck, and unload your boxes. Finding the right moving company is a big commitment so you need to do your research carefully before you make a decision.


Avoid the Internet at first. This is the easiest way to get caught in a moving scam. Instead, check out the listings in your phone book, call a local real estate agent, or ask friends for their recommendations.
Pick a place that will do an in-home estimate. If they won't, hang up the phone.
Make sure the company will be doing it themselves, and not sub-contracting to have someone else do it.
Make sure the company can give you a ""Your Rights and Responsibilities When You Move"" booklet.
Get as much information about the company as you can. Try to pick a company that has been in business for at least ten years. Ask about the included services, and for a list of references.

, You'll need to have the company's DOT and MC license numbers to do this. Now you can make sure that the company is not only authorized to perform your move, but that they have insurance to do it.


First, check out SafeSys.org. Type those DOT and MC numbers into the site and see what comes up.Next, make sure the company checks out on the 'FMCSA Licensing & Insurance site' link on the bottom of the report you get about the company.
Last, check out the Better Business Report to read up on the company., The company will send a representative to check out all of your stuff and to give you an estimate about how much it will cost to move it all. The company will give you an estimate based on what they see in your home.


Don't use a company that will only give you an estimate based on cubic feet.
If you really want to find the best company, you can arrange to have two or three companies to come and make an assessment and pick the one with the best service and best prices. But this will be more time-consuming.

, Decide on a rate that works for both of you, and sign a contract that is well-detailed and suits your needs. Never sign a blank contract. Through your arrangement, you will decide on the moving date.

, Now that you've chosen your moving company and have decided on a date, it's time to prepare for the big move. Though you won't be doing any heavy lifting, you should still be around when the movers transport and unload your stuff. This will be an exception if you're arranging them to move your stuff into your new place when you won't be there.


When the movers are unloading your stuff, stay out of their way. Don't offer to help unless they have questions.
Reward your movers. Once they've done their hard work, or even while they're doing their hard work, order some lunch for them if you want to be nice. And make sure to give them a generous tip., Now that you've unloaded your stuff at your new home, it's likely that you're feeling overwhelmed. Have patience and don't force yourself to start unpacking everything right away. Just focus on getting it done little by little and you'll have your new place ready in no time. Here's what you can do:


Unpack your essential items first. Unpack the stuff from your ""essential stuff"" box. Put up your shower curtain in case you need a relaxing shower and make your bed if you just want to collapse.
Try to unpack your kitchen items early on. Though you should relax and eat take-out when you first arrive at your new place, you can't do that forever. The sooner your kitchen is set up, the sooner you can start living a normal life.
Assemble all of your big furniture. Make sure you assemble it in the room where it belongs.
Do only as much as you can each day. Though you shouldn't wait months to unpack, you are probably overwhelmed after your move, so unpack as many boxes as you can until you need a break. Remember to take the time to enjoy your new surroundings.

, Once you've started the unpacking process, it'll be time to go shopping for any items you may need. Your shopping can include going to the grocery store to stock your fridge, buying any furniture you may need, or replacing items you can't find.


Take it one step at a time. If you really need a lot of new items, make a day of it, but if you just need a few things, you don't have to do it all at once.

, Once you're far along in the unpacking process, or just feel like taking a break, it's time to get to know your neighborhood. This is a great way to feel more comfortable in your new surroundings and to feel like your stressful move will pay off in the end. Here's what to do:


Go for a walk. Not only will this relieve stress and give you great exercise, but you will have a better sense of the feel of your neighborhood, what your neighbors are like, and what stores or parks are near you.
Look online or in a local newspaper to check out cultural attractions, bars, or restaurants. See what your new hood has to offer.
Tell your Facebook friends that you've moved to a new place. Ask if they have any recommendations of where to go or even where to shop. Even people you barely know will be happy to offer advice on this topic.
Get to know your neighbors. Be friendly to the people in your neighborhood. You'll end up making more local friends and getting insider tips on your community in the process.

Turn off the fountain.,
Drain the water out of the fountain.,
Scrub the fountain.,
Clean the pump.,
Descale the fountain.",How to Clean a Water Fountain1," Before cleaning your fountain, it's best to turn it off and take the pump out to make cleaning easier. You can also remove any items in the fountain, such as large rocks.Always check your manual before cleaning, as different fountains may require different cleaning methods.;
, For smaller fountains, you can just dump the water out.For larger fountains, a shop vac may be easier to remove the water from the fountain., If the fountain is small, it may be easiest to bring it into a sink to clean.If it's larger, you'll need to clean it outside. A toothbrush or other soft brush is perfect for this purpose. Use a mild soap such as dishwashing soap or even CLR to clean the fountain.If your fountain is copper, make sure you only use a very soft rag on it.
Keep going until the fountain is clean. If you are having trouble removing algae, you can buy products specifically made for breaking down algae. Consider wiping the fountain down with a mild bleach solution to help keep new growth from happening.Clean smaller fountains more often (once a month) and larger fountains less often (every other month or so)., In a sink, unscrew the side of the pump that comes off, which should show you the propeller. You can use the same brush you used on the fountain to clean the propeller. Get all the debris out you can, and then replace the pump in the fountain., If your fountain has hard water buildup, use a special product to help remove it, such as CLR. You can also use a mixture of half white vinegar, half water. Let the fountain soak in the solution, and then scrub it again with a gentle brush or sponge."

Take an inventory of your possessions.,
Take photographs to document everything of value.,
Research the cost of airfare.,
Get quotes for trailers and moving trucks.,
Investigate moving companies.,
Determine the reliability of your vehicle.,
Calculate the cost of driving your vehicle.,
Make a realistic list of road trip costs, primarily food and lodging.,
Shop around for vehicle shipping rates.,
Scenario One:


Drive vehicle, have possessions shipped.,
Scenario Two:


Drive vehicle, tow trailer with possessions.,
Scenario Three:


Drive rental truck with possessions, tow vehicle.,
Scenario Four:


Drive rental truck with possessions, ship vehicle.,
Scenario Five:


Fly to destination, have possessions and vehicle shipped.,
Scenario Six:


Sell the car and other heavy items.,
Be creative.",How to Move Cross Country," Take stock of everything that you own, particularly vehicles, furniture, and heavy things that take up a lot of room.


How much are these items worth?
If it costs more to ship these possessions than to buy new ones, are you willing to let them go?;
, This will give you a time stamped record of the condition of your possessions.


If you choose to purchase insurance, be sure to get replacement cost only insurance. The other kind is literally based on the replacement cost of weight, not value.

, If you have any flexibility around your moving date, use the ""flexible date"" feature with online booking sites to figure out when the cheapest flights are.


Look into how much baggage an airline allows you to bring along. In some cases, you can bring up to 100 lbs of luggage with you, and additional luggage can be checked at a reasonable price. This can be useful if, say, you want to bring your computer with you for fear the movers may ruin it. You can wrap a computer tightly in bubble wrap and pack in a suitcase as part of your luggage allowance.

, There are many different options. Be sure to do your research and write down all quotes. Once you do the math, you'll be able to assess what will work with your resources.


Plan ahead if you need a hitch! If you need a hitch for your vehicle, make sure they will have hitch in stock. Sometimes you have to order it and it takes a few days before it will arrive.
If you rent a moving truck, how much will it cost to rent the size you need, and how many days and miles will that rate cover?
If you have a vehicle, how much would it cost to pull the vehicle with a tow dolly? It might also be cheaper to do things the other way around: Drive your vehicle and tow a trailer. How much will that cost?

, Find out how much it'd cost to hire a full-service moving company (this might be easier on your back and your possessions in terms of loading and unloading, see Warnings below).


You can also look into ""self move"" services, which drop off a containing unit, let you load it at your leisure, and pick it up and transport it for you.
There are sites where you can describe your needs and people will make bids as to how much they'll charge to do it for you. As with all your research, you want to ask how much it'll cost, how long it'll take, and how you're guarded against damages.
Books can often weigh a personal vehicle down significantly. Fear not! They can be shipped through the USPS at 'media rate'. Another often ignored option is using the greyhound shipping service which offers a huge discount to students. Both options allow you to pick up your items as much as 2 weeks later which is useful if you don't know where you are moving to!

, Do you trust that you can drive it over two thousand miles without worrying about it breaking down on you? Does it need any major repairs before it can withstand such a trip?


Most automobiles, reliable or not, should receive a major maintenance visit to the mechanic (with special attention to radiator, transmission, and brakes) before embarking on a cross-country trek. The cost of the maintenance could save thousands (literally) in emergency repairs, towing, etc.
If you're considering pulling a trailer, does your vehicle have enough horsepower to pull it across the distance and landscape you're looking at?
Driving across a country often means driving across different elevations, climates and terrains. Can your vehicle make it up and down a few mountains? Are the brakes in good shape? Does it have a tendency to overheat? Do the air conditioner and the heat work?
Check the weather. Weather.com and similar websites can actually give you the weather of your travel route. Consider things like mountain passes, if possible avoid them or be prepared to put chains on your vehicle if the situation requires it. Map your destination online and don't leave home without a current Road Atlas. Decide if investing in a satellite navigation system for your car is within your budget.

, Determine the fuel efficiency of the vehicle you'll be using so that you can estimate how much the fuel will cost.


Find out how many miles or kilometres your trip will cover, then divide that number by your MPG (miles per gallon) or km/l (kilometres per litre). That will tell you how much fuel you will need to cover the entire journey. Multiply that number by the current or expected price per gallon/price per litre to see how much money you'll be spending on gas through the whole trip.
Example: If your trip is 2,000 miles and your car gets 30 miles per gallon, then 2,000 miles / 30 miles = 66.5 gallons, approximately. If the price of fuel is at about $4 per gallon, the fuel will cost 66.5 gallons x $4 = $266.
Example: If your trip is 1,000 kilometres and your vehicle travels 15 kilometres per litre, then 1,000 km ÷ 15 km/l = 67 litres, approximately. If the price of fuel is at about €1 per litre, the fuel will cost 67 litres x €1 = €67.
Remember that the MPG or the km/l of your vehicle will be reduced if you'll be towing a trailer or adding considerable weight to the vehicle in any way.

,


How long will driving take?
If you must stay in hotels or motels, how much will it cost you? How much will you spend on meals and snacks?
Do you plan on sight-seeing on your way, perhaps tasting some wine, or visiting old friends?

, There are companies that specialize in shipping vehicles across long distances. Make phone calls and ask the following questions:


How long will it take?
How much will it cost?
How am I guarded against damages to my vehicle?
What is this company's reputation? You can usually find reviews online.

,
• Consider increased likelihood of damage to your possessions if they're in someone else's hands.
• Driving the vehicle rather than shipping or towing it will mean more wear and tear on the vehicle.
• Most conducive to sight-seeing.

,
• Consider decreased likelihood of damage to your possessions if they remain in your hands.
• Driving the vehicle rather than shipping or towing it will mean more wear and tear on the vehicle.
• Towing a heavy trailer will place additional strain on your vehicle, and you may need to have a hitch installed.

,
• Consider decreased likelihood of damage to your possessions if they remain in your hands.
• Less wear and tear on the vehicle.

,
• Consider decreased likelihood of damage to your possessions if they remain in your hands.
• Less wear and tear on the vehicle, but greater chance of vehicle being damaged or scratched.
• Have a backup car at your destination in case the vehicle transportation takes longer than expected.
• Can tow a trailer behind the rental truck for bringing additional possessions.

,
• Consider increased likelihood of damage to your possessions if they're in someone else's hands.
• Less wear and tear on the vehicle, but greater chance of vehicle being damaged or scratched.
• Easier but more expensive when children are involved.
• Have a backup car at your destination in case the vehicle transportation takes longer than expected.
• You might get to your destination before your possessions do.
• Can bring some possessions on the plane.

, Ship the rest. Fly to destination. It may be cheaper or only slightly more expensive to sell car, and other item first and then buy newer items at the destination. Take into account of the cost of shipping these heavy items and buying newer items at destination. One gets to enjoy newer technology in the case of tv, computer, and car.

, Consider options not listed here that are unique to your situation.


Maybe a friend or relative is willing to drive your vehicle and possessions across the country for you, just for the experience; you can offer to pay for their gas, lodging and it might still be cheaper than using a vehicle shipping service.
It could actually make sense for you to let go of all of your large possessions and travel by train or bus. The possibilities are endless. Consider what's best for you and your situation, and enjoy the ride!

Attach the showerhead and shower arm to the top of your pipe.,
Consider alternate methods of holding up your shower.",How to Build an Outdoor Shower1," The most important part of an outdoor shower, of course, is the shower itself. While almost everyone wants an enclosure and/or floor to shower on. those looking for a simple rinse-off can simply install their outdoor shower head, run water to it, and call it a day. There are two ways to run water to your shower:


Using a garden hose and an outdoor water source, such as a lake or garden hose spigot.
Attaching your shower to the side of the house and tapping into the internal plumbing. Because this method is extremely difficult without experience and serious tools, this article will focus on the prior method.;
, You need to know how all of your pieces -- showerhead, floor, and walls -- fit together before you get building. You do not, for example, want to build the shower head and then realize that you cannot fit a floor around it. Go online and check out some examples, or draft up your own. You can even buy kits of pre-cut wood and flooring that are made for outdoor showers online if you want a simpler project., Again, there are a lot of different ways that you could build your outdoor shower, but this common list of supplies will be needed for the vast majority of projects and designs. You should have:


A garden hose that can reach your shower from the water source.
Three pieces of 1/2"" thick galvanized piping.

Two pieces 36"" long.
One piece 8"" long


Appropriate garden hose to pipe adapter joints.
2 1/2"" elbow joints
A ball valve or gate faucet and adapter to fit into your piping.
A rain-shower head.
C-shaped hangers or plumbing ties hold your pipe upright.
Plumbing tape., Again, there are a few ways to pull this off. The most common way is to screw the hose into an outdoor spigot, allowing you to turn the water on and off with ease. You will then attach your hose to the end of the piping.


If you want to use a lake or pond to power your shower, you'll need an inline utility pump and a car or marine battery to pull water from the lake to your shower. A 12V self-priming pump is your best bet., Use the joints to screw the piping together into one length, placing your ball valve/gate faucet in the center -- this will be your on/off switch. If you've never done plumbing before, don't worry too much about this project -- it is about as simple as it can get. Some tips include:


Place two elbow joints at the ends, each facing different directions. One is for your shower head, the other for the garden hose.
Be sure to seal each joint with nylon plumber's tape to prevent leakage, wrapping each joint 4-6 times.Don't attach the hose or shower head just yet -- wait until you've finished the plumbing and attached the rods., If you're building a free-standing shower that isn't attached to your house, you'll need a way to hold the shower up. The most common way to do this is with a post. Use pressure-treated wood, purchasing a post that is roughly 8 feet tall. It can be either square or rounded -- just make sure your get the appropriate brackets for your post. If in any doubt, talk to a specialist at your home improvement store about your specific project. Once you have your post:


Dig a post hole at least 1-1/2 feet deep and three times as wide as your post.
Firmly implant the post in the ground.
Mix a 5lb bag of fast-setting concrete and pour it into the hole to set the post.
Wait 24-hours for the concrete to set., The most common way to do this is with c-shaped pipe hangers, and you should only need two of them. Adhere one near the top and one near the bottom to securely fasten the piping to your shower post. You could also use 4-6 pipe straps to hold the piping on.


Make sure that your elbow joints point the right way before continuing -- you need the top one to face into the shower and the bottom one needs to turn enough that you can fit the garden hose onto it.

, For a more attractive design, you can drill a 1/2 hole into the bottom of the post, even with the bottom elbow joint. You can then feed the 8"" galvanized pipe through the post, allowing you to attach the garden hose behind the shower post instead of to the side.


You'll likely need an adapter to fit the hose to your piping. This is called a ""hose coupler."", Once the entire array is hooked up, it's time to attach the shower head. Attach the shower arm to the top of the pipe, angle it to your desired location, then screw in the shower head. Turn on the water at the faucet and give the entire thing a test.

, There are tons of great DIY shower ideas on the internet, and you should do some exploring to see if you can get away with a less conventional set-up for your outdoor shower. Some ideas include:


Attaching the shower head to a wooden fence, tree, or other already created post.
Attaching the head to an overhang or wall with a simple bracket or wooden board.
Attach the head to something decorative, like an old surfboard, for a unique look."
"
See if the water is flowing freely.,
Clean the mouthpiece.,
Wash the rest of the fountain.,
Descale the fountain.",How to Clean a Water Fountain2," The water should flow out of the mouthpiece readily, and it should lift up at least 3 inches above the fountain. The height of the stream is important because it keeps people from putting their mouths on the metal part of the fountain., Squirt disinfectant on the mouthpiece, as well as the guard that sits over it. Use a brush to clean all around the mouthpiece and guard, including where the water comes out. Once done, use water to rinse the area thoroughly., A damp cloth is generally enough to clean the rest of the fountain's surfaces. Wipe it down thoroughly.However, you may want to use some disinfectant on the areas that are most touched, such as the fountain's buttons. Wipe down areas you use disinfectant on with a clean cloth and water.

, Drinking fountains need to be descaled from time to time because of a build up of hard water. Spray the fountain with a descaling solution where the it has hard water buildup, and then scrub it with a cloth soaked in the same solution until the scaling comes off. Wipe it down with clean water when you're done."

Consider how much drainage you'll need when constructing the floor and walls.,
Tramp down a thick layer of gravel for easy, cost-effective flooring.,
Build a simple wood floor for a professional looking shower.,
Use plywood or corrugated metal sheets with wooden posts for a simple, customizable wall.,
Purchase pre-built outdoor shower walls for a professional, easy finish.,
Use a curved shower curtain to build an easy wall around your shower.,
Stain and finish any wood so that it is waterproof.",How to Build an Outdoor Shower2," If you're only running cold water to your shower, chances are good you won't be spending hours getting wet. As such, drainage should not be a major concern. Still, you need some layer between your feet and the ground, otherwise you'll end up with dirty, muddy feet after every shower.

, Gravel is by far the most common bottom for outdoor showers. It is easy to install, looks good, and naturally drains away water if you take shorter showers. You can buy gravel, river pebbles, or small stone mixes depending on your aesthetic desires. To effectively install a gravel floor:


Smooth out the flooring the best you can.
Lay down your stones around the shower. For a more professional look, use half-buried 2x4s to create a simple enclosure around your shower that will hold the gravel in.
Use a tamper to press the gravel tightly together, leaving you with a smooth, regular floor., You'll need one 8-foot 4x4"" piece of wood and one 8-foot 1x4"" piece, both pressure treated. You'll use the first piece to build a square base for your floor, and the second piece to put together the drainable flooring. For a cheap, pre-made alternative, consider using a wooden pallet.Cut one of the 4x4's into 4 even pieces, then screw them together into a simple square frame.
Cut a 1x4"" into 7 individual pieces, each 26-1/2"" long.
Place your 7 pieces onto your board starting on the edge, each piece parallel to the next. Leave a 1/4"" space between each board for water to drain through.
Screw the floorboards into the wooden frame., The easiest way to make a shower wall is to set up four more posts (identical to the one holding up your piping) in the ground, then nail plywood sheets to the posts as walls. You can then attach decorative shingles, paint or stain the plywood, or add a door/curtain instead of wood for one of the sides., You can get a set of outdoor shower walls from a variety of places, and there are a lot of different sets out there that can make your life much easier. However, these sets can run up to $1,000, so it may be more cost-effective to build your own walls instead., This strategy, of course, only works if your shower is attached to a wall or fence. That said, a simple curved shower rod can cover up the other 3 sides and leave you an easy, breezy outdoor shower experience., An outdoor shower will be up against the elements, and regular water will warp and ruin wood if you don't take precautions. Use an outdoor sealant and finisher to protect your shower for years to come."

Choose a location.,
Think about placing your waterfall near an electrical source.,
Plan the size of your stream.,
Get your boulders, rocks, and gravel.,
Prepare for any digging you may need to do by outlining the waterfall placement with spray paint and calling the relevant utility authority.,
Start excavating your foundation if you need to.,
Measure out and cut both underlayment and rubber liner.,
Set up your lower basin.,
Start from the bottom up, placing larger boulders first.,
Use larger stones near each waterfall if possible.,
Periodically step back from your waterfall and look at the piece from a different angle.,
Place the spillway rocks carefully.,
Use mortar to stabilize any larger stones.,
Force smaller stones and gravel beneath all sides and spillways to keep water from seeping through.,
Foam in between any small cracks and crevasses using a specially-made dark foam sealant.,
Install a bacteria tank for any fish you may want to keep in your pond (optional).,
Layer gravel carefully across the bottom of any exposed surfaces of the liner.








,
Turn on the garden hose and spray down the entire area of your stream until the water level in the bottom basin is full.








,
Turn on the power for the pump and check that the water is flowing correctly.,
Check for incorrect water flow.,
Finish off by trimming away any excess liner.",How to Build a Waterfall," You can install a waterfall on a natural slope or hill, or you can dig out the slope yourself. Alternately, if the soil or foundation you're digging into is difficult to excavate, consider building the stream above ground using a combination of rocks and gravel as your base.


How much of a slope will you need? The absolute minimum slope you need is a 2 inch (5cm) drop for every 10 feet (3m) of stream.Of course, the steeper the slope, the faster the water runs and the louder the sound of the waterfall.;
, You want your lower basin, which sends water back up to the top of the waterfall, to be located near an electrical source so that you don't have to string an unsightly extension cord across your otherwise pristine garden.

, Knowing just how much water passes through your stream and waterfalls will help you determine how large your upper pool and lower basin need to be. (You don't want your garden overflowing when you turn the pump off.) Here's how do to that:


First, estimate the amount of water that passes through a linear foot of your stream. If your stream is relatively small — say it's about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) wide and 2 to 3 inches deep — estimate about 5 gallons (18.9 L) of water per linear foot. Add to or subtract from that estimate depending on the size and depth of your proposed stream.
Next, measure the total stream capacity. Measure out how many linear feet your entire stream takes up. Now, simply make sure that either your upper pool or lower basin holds more than the total stream capacity. So if your stream capacity is 100 gallons (378.5 L), a 50 gallon (189.3 L) basin and a 200 gallon (757.1 L) pool will easily accommodate the stream.

, Generally, waterfalls contain three different sizes of stone: boulders, or larger stones, which frame the waterfall(s); rocks, or medium-sized stone, which serve as the connecting stones; and gravel, which fills in the bottom of the stream and in between cracks and crevasses.


Visit a ""rock,"" ""quarry,"" or ""gravel and stone"" dealer in person to get a feel for what kinds of stones your waterfall might enjoy. This is a much more reliable way of getting exactly what you want, as opposed to merely ordering a kit and hoping that the stones are ones that will look good in your backyard.
Here's what you can expect to order when it comes time to buying stones for your waterfall:

1.5 - 2 tons of large (12 - 24 inches) boulders for upper pool and lower basin, plus 2 - 6 tons extra for 10 feet (3.0 m) portions of stream that are above ground
.75 ton of medium (6 - 24 inches) rocks per 10 feet (3.0 m) of stream
.5 ton of small (.5 - 2 inches) gravel per 10 feet (3.0 m) of stream, plus 1 - 2 tons for the upper pool and lower basin each



, Spray-painting the outline of your stream — and any waterfalls — will help greatly when it comes time to dig. Calling 811 and making sure your excavation won't damage any water or gas mains is a must.







, Dig out any part of your stream that'll be below ground. Next, dig out a large enough area for your lower sump basin, making sure to leave space for surrounding gravel and stone. Finally, place medium-sized rocks and larger boulders around the perimeter of the stream to begin to hem in the stream.








, Starting with underlayment and then finishing with the liner, stretch them over the entire distance of the waterfall, into the lower basin, and across pond (if there is one). Place some of the rocks on the membrane plastic to hold it in place, or use poly rock panels in sheets to save time.









When placing the underlayment and liner, be sure to leave slack at the bottom of each waterfall. Placing rocks and boulders onto these areas can stretch out the liners, causing rips and piercings if there's not enough slack.

, Drill holes into your sump basin if it doesn't already come with them. (See below for more instructions.) Place your sump basin into the excavated hole at the bottom of the waterfall, above the underlayment and liner. Insert the pump to the sump basin, connect the water line, and make sure the hose extends all the way up to the upper pool. Once the basin is set up, secure in place by adding layers of small - medium size stone (not gravel) around the basin. Attach the lid of the sump basin.









Some sump basins will come already perforated, but many will not. Basins need holes to allow the water to come in. If you need to perforate the basin yourself, the job isn't difficult. Starting from the bottom, drill a hole into the side of the basin using a 2 inch bit. Moving around the side, drill a hole every 4 inches. After you've drilled around once, move up an inch or two and continue drilling another revolution.
When the bottom third of the basin is perforated, graduate to a 1 inch bit for the middle third section, and finally a 3/8 inch bit for the top third.

, Always start from lower elevation and work your way up to higher elevation when placing the first rocks. A good bet is to start off with your largest boulders in place so that they give context and contrast. Backfill any soil beneath large boulders as needed, paying particular attention to boulders perched on elevation.









Placing a larger character boulder behind a the actual beginning of the waterfall itself is a great way to build dimension in your waterfall. Character boulders to the sides of the waterfall work great as well.

, In nature's streams, especially near waterfalls, smaller stones and pebbles tend to get swept away down current. That's why larger stones look more natural close to waterfalls. Stick with a good combination of medium and larger stones for a more natural look if you feel like your waterfall looks artificial.

, In the moment, placing stones gives you a great idea of how things will look up close. What it doesn't do is give you a perspective of how things look from afar. Periodically take a steps back from stone placement and decide whether you like the arrangement of stones where they are. You may place a single stone or boulder four or five times before you're happy with where it's placed.

, Slate makes for an excellent spill stone. Don't be afraid to use smaller stones or even small pebbles to create the base for your spillway. Here are some other things to keep in mind when building spillways:









If you're having trouble keeping your spillway stone in place, sometimes a larger stone on top of it will anchor it in place while you build its base.
Always measure the slope of your spillway with a level. This is important for two big reasons. First, going front to back, you'll want your spillway stone to be either level or sloped slightly downward; if it's sloped upward, water isn't going to travel down it nicely. Second, going side to side, make sure your spillway stone is level; this will ensure that the water travels over the entire surface evenly and doesn't pool on one side.
Small cobblestones or rocks jutting out from beneath spillways can give accent to an otherwise uniform waterfall.

, If you're dealing with a particular large group of stones on a bigger waterfall, don't be afraid to mortar them together into place. Mortaring larger stones will help stabilize them and ensure that none of them will tip over should the landscape shift slightly.

, This also gives the waterfall a more natural look, shielding eyes from unsightly liner material.








, Foam sealant works best on cool and damp stone surfaces, so mist your stream and waterfall if necessary beforehand. Start spraying only a little at a time as you begin; the foam may expand more than you anticipate, and once it's applied, it's harder to remove en masse.









Although other foam sealants can be used in place of specially-made waterfall sealants, they do contain toxic chemicals that are harmful to fish. So if you're planning on introducing fish into your pond, be sure to use one that's specifically designed for use alongside fish.
Give the foam at least 30 minutes, and up to an hour, to dry completely. If you're ready to, you can finish foaming and start your waterfall easily in the same day.
Consider sprinkling neutral-colored gravel or sediment on top of the drying foam. This will disguise the black foam and cause it to blend into the surroundings more.
When foaming, wear gloves and be sure to wear something that wouldn't mind throwing away. If you accidentally get foam onto a boulder, you can easily wait for it to dry and then scrape it off.

, If you decide to have Koi in your pond, this is a good time to install a bacteria tank to help keep the Koi alive.

,,, When the water begins running clear, move the pump over to the start of the waterfall and turn off the water from the garden hose. Make the pump less conspicuous by covering it with gravel or burying it in foliage.

, Your waterfall should now begin flowing without the help of a garden hose. Check to make sure that the liner levels are all correct and that any splashing is contained by rocks.








, Add aquatic or semi-aquatic plants to any bogs in your stream, and consider stocking your pond with fish. If you'd like, add drama with submersible lighting or outdoor lighting.

Consider the area where you are going to put your fountain.,
Remember that fountains can be very heavy.,
Figure out how you are going to power the fountain.,
Place the fountain in full sun if you plan to have a solar powered fountain.,
Consider purchasing a fountain that has an overflow mechanism if you live somewhere where it rains a lot.",How to Build an Outdoor Garden Water Fountain1," Take into consideration the area’s size. The size of the area you plan to put it in will determine how large a fountain you can build.


Think about whether the area is conducive to handling leaks that your fountain may have. Will you be able to access the fountain easily in the area that you are planning on putting it?;
, Once you install your fountain, it will be very hard to move, or even shift it slightly.


If you are planning on putting your fountain on a balcony, deck, or in a rooftop garden, keep in mind the weight of the fountain. Make sure that the surface you are planning to put the fountain on can bear its weight.

, You will have to determine where you will run the line that will bring power to your fountain’s pump.


Another option is to install a solar-powered fountain. Solar powered fountains are easier to install and are environmentally friendly, but you have to work in a sunny area for the solar powers to efficiently power the fountain.

, You will have to put your solar-powered fountain in an area that gets full and direct sunlight, as the sunlight will help to keep your water fountain running.


Understand that solar powered pumps are not a good option if you want to put fish in your fountain because the fountain won’t run at night. This means that oxygen levels will drop and your fish could suffocate.

, If you live in a wet climate and want to keep fish in your fountain, it is important to purchase a fountain that has an overflow mechanism. This is because when it rains, your fountain could overflow and the fish could spill out. The overflow mechanism will keep them alive.

"
"
Pick your pump.,
Buy your fountain.,
Prepare your water supply.",How to Build an Outdoor Garden Water Fountain2," The pump is what will propel your water into the air, thus making it an essential part of any fountain. Purchase either an electric or solar powered pump. When determining which pump to buy, consider how many gallons of water each pump can move; the larger your fountain, the more power it will require.


Tubes or pipes are usually supplied with the pump but you may need to purchase these separately, especially if those supplied with the pump aren’t long enough for your requirements.

, The fountain you buy will depend on your personal preferences and the size of the area that you plan to put your fountain in. Fountains can come in all different sizes, shapes and material.


Frost-proof ceramic vessels are a popular choice for garden fountains.
You can also choose to dig a pond, or add a large ceramic basin that has a stream of water that shoots up from the middle.

, Don’t use freshly-poured tap water for fish or aquatic plants. Either use rainwater or leave some tap water to stand for 48 hours so the chemical level falls. You might also want to have some aquatic plants on standby for when your water feature is installed.

"
"
Figure out where your power line will run.,
Set up the fountain you have purchased.,
Attach your pump to the fountain.,
Fill your fountain with water.,
Tailor your fountain to your fish (optional).",How to Build an Outdoor Garden Water Fountain3," Either run your power line to the area where you plan to put your fountain, or set up your solar power pump. Read the directions that come with the mechanism, as each power line or solar power pump is different.

, Assemble it according to the directions that come with the fountain. Many time, you will have to run the power line up to the fountain.


You will then have to install your pump. However, you should make sure your pump works before you do this. To check that your pump works properly, fill a bucket or container with water and test the pump by running that water through it.

, Raise your pump as high as you would like your water to go. Make sure that the pump is on a level surface and that it cannot be easily displaced by a heavy flow of water.


You can hide the pump mechanism by surrounding it with river rocks. Keep in my that you will most likely have to access it later for cleaning and maintenance, so do not bury it too deeply under river rocks.

, Once the fountain is filled, switch on the pump and adjust the water flow. Remember to regularly check the level of your water, particularly during hot weather.


Hot air could make your water evaporate.

, If you want to have fish in your fountain, determine the kind of fish you want and then find out what sort of environment they need to survive. Keep in mind things like:


How much oxygen in the water they need.
The kind of food they need.
Hiding spaces.
How much space each fish needs.

Start cleaning junk and personal items out of your desk before you give notice.,
Turn in your two weeks notice at work now that you've had a week to do the above steps.,
Work very hard your last two weeks.,
Put your car up for sale if you won't be needing it.,
Keep your new employer posted.,
Iron out the details.,
Get to your new city several days before you begin your new job.",How to Move to a Bigger City for a New Job," You may be tempted to scream your good fortunes from every roof top in town but it's important you keep quiet for a few days. Don't go blabbing just yet. There are a few more things you must do before everything becomes common knowledge. The next few weeks need to be choreographed like an Olympic synchronized swim team to make this all happen without a hitch.


Get your new job offer in writing. Don't quit your current job until you have a signed offer in hand from your new job. Most people would be shocked to know how many companies make verbal offers or say the ""letter is in the mail"" or ""being emailed today"" and the offer never arrives. A phone offer won't do. Insist that you receive something in writing. Make sure the offer is very specific and includes the details you agreed upon regarding your compensation, benefits, etc. Some states have laws that will protect you if the new boss or company backs down between the time you accept and the time you start. You may still be out of work but the new job may be responsible for reimbursing you or even giving you a severance package.

Research the area well before you accept a position. They may take advantage of your small town background and not offer you pay on the same scale as others in your position. They may not be offering you enough to survive on in your new town.;
, Also discuss it with your parents or other adult family members who might be affected by your move. You still have time to back out should you learn your parents have something medical going on and moving is not advised. This is not the time to mention it to your kids or casually discuss it with co-workers. You don't want to tell your boss until after a few more things are in order. Now is not a good time to find out that your boss's kid sits next to your kid in art class. Wait a while until your ducks are in a row.

, Tell them when you are moving. Schedule a home inspection. You'd rather deal with an issue while you're in town than try to deal with it when a sale is on the line and you're miles away and starting a new job.

, If you have pets, consider how they will be moved. Ideally you have given yourself at least 4 weeks, preferably 8 weeks to quit and get moved. If you only have 4 weeks you should take the first week to plan, give your notice the last Friday on the first week, work your two weeks but at night and on weekends work on packing, getting rid of junk and taking unwanted items to charity. The fourth week you will have about two days in your old home before you'll need to hit the road.


Some companies will not require you to provide two weeks notice but you should still offer one. Don't base any time line on an employer's history of asking people to leave the day they give their notice. Depending on your position, other staffing situations you may be unaware of, etc., you may be working your entire two weeks.
If you are close enough to your new location, you can use your weekends to move small loads with your car. Consider taking up cleaning items and getting a head start. When you arrive, you can move right in with your stuff since the place will be clean.

, Moving isn't cheap. Hopefully your new employer is helping but if not you should start liquidating assets, figuring out if you can tap your 401K or asking for a loan to get you the cash you need to relocate if you don't have it in savings. More and more companies are not offering relocation. Before you accept any offer you should have an idea of how you can afford to move, get into a home and survive until you get your first paycheck without moving assistance. Make a folder and keep it handy. Label it ""Moving Paperwork and Receipts"" and keep all confirmations, paperwork, receipts, deposit details, etc. If you are being reimbursed, you will need it. If you're footing the bill you can keep this file for tax purposes. It's also a great way to keep everything organized and see how your budget is being used.

,


Find out what requirements are necessary to quit
Are you paid on sick leave? Only vacation?
When does your insurance coverage end?
Should you schedule medical appointments for you and your family? Better to do it now than wait until you are knee deep in boxes. It's especially important if you will lose your coverage on your last day of work.
Check for non-competition rules. Be clear that you are released from any non-compete and get it in writing. You don't want to start your new job only to be served with cease and desist papers. If you're moving to the big times you'll be playing by more corporate rules.

, Take those days to visit your new city and find a new place to live. Many companies will not let you call in sick or take ANY time after you have given notice. Get maps of the area, the immediate neighborhood, the public transportation routes. You can start planning your new life with right information. However, your boss might not like finding out that's what you were doing on your sick days (see Warnings).


Pick up a travel book from your local book store before you go. If it's a big city you can probably find a travel book on it in the travel section. Read up and you can apply many of the tips for tourist to yourself your first few weeks. Learn when and when not to travel certain areas in certain ways, what restaurants are over priced, free events, and so on. It's a great way to learn more about your new home.
Good places to live are hard to find in bigger cities. If you find something you like and can afford you should sign the paperwork and be prepared to give them a deposit.
Don't try to move into something so expensive you'll need a roommate. You may have trouble finding one in a big new city. It's better to get something cheap and move up later on when you've found a good one.
When you find a new home you should take a camera and take pictures of each room from different angles. Take a tape measure and measure each room and closet. You'll probably lose square footage if you are moving from a small town to a big city. It's better to find out while you still have time to get rid of things than when you've moved and can't fit it all.

, Don't be obvious but do little things each day or stay later to do it discretely in the evenings. Clean personal information, passwords, etc. off your work computer. Don't forget pictures, emails, contacts, and so on. As a general rule you should get everything personal from inside your desk and any items that could be overlooked or missed from your walls or outside your desk should your old boss or security pack it for you. Don't forget to take copies of your handbook, any complimentary or praising memos about you, etc.

, Make sure to keep it as professional and respectful as possible. This is not the time to air dirty laundry or tell them you're leaving because your boss is evil.


Be prepared to receive a counter offer.
Be prepared to experience guilt.
Be prepared to be shunned and abused. Just roll with it! You're almost out.

, Your last two weeks can make up for a multitude of sins or ruin a long, reputable work relationship. Work hard and be productive. Consult with your supervisor and ask what else you can do to help with the transition. Help them make the transition as pain free as possible. Take extra time with junior employees. You will be under a microscope once they find out you're leaving.


Use lunches to pick up moving supplies.
Use lunches to haul unneeded things to charity stores.
Use lunches to meet with co-workers instead of getting together after work when you need to be packing.
Return borrowed items to any co-workers and ask for any items that were borrowed from you to be returned.
Post an ad on the bulletin board with any items you are selling.

, Some larger cities offer tax breaks on hybrid vehicles or allow you to travel in the HOV lanes. Check with the DMV. If you want to have a car you should consider switching to a hybrid. Remember, gas is almost always more expensive in bigger cities. If you were planning to buy a new car, research the sales taxes and other costs in your new state. You may be able to save yourself hundreds of dollars by buying before you go or waiting until you get there. See how the areas differ. Consider using public transportation, a bicycle, a scooter, a moped, etc.

, Although things will be busy, you should speak to or email them fairly regularly during your last few weeks at your old home. Keep them updated on finding a new home, notice turned in, etc. They can also be helpful in learning about your new town. You don't want your new employer to be out of touch for too long. If they don't hear from you they may think you've changed your mind. Make sure you have given your future employer a realistic timeline for your move and start date! If you must change the time line you should do it now and not the day before you were supposed to begin. If you were going to ask for one extra day you should go ahead and ask for three. Chances are, if you are behind schedule now, you will be more behind later and you won't have to continue calling and changing. However, asking your new employer for too much time to relocate can be disastrous. Try asking your new boss when they need you and work together to create a fair and reasonable timeline.

,


Contact utilities. Find out if there is a deposit and plan for the extra money needed.
Contact schools: register, withdrawal, get copies of anything you may need.
Check out the Department of Motor Vehicles (or equivalent) website for requirements in your new town. It should have a wealth of information regarding fees, taxes, inspections and getting a new license or ID.
Many larger cities have unions. If your current position is unionized you may need to join before you can begin. That may require fees.

, Unpack and get settled. Take public transportation to work and from work to home the week before you start. Make a dry run at at the actual times you would be commuting. Get a feel for the system. Keep a map with you at all times once you get to your new town. If you get off at the wrong subway stop or get turned around on your way home from the store you won't be completely lost with the map. If possible, call your new boss to let them know you've made it to town. Resist getting sucked in early. You still have to get things hooked up and transferred. And don't forget to take a deep breath and pat yourself on the back. Congratulations on a fresh start!

Dig a top-pool or small well (40cm deep) at a higher ground level than your pond.,
Construct your foundation gradually down from the top-pool into your pond, ensure the foundation is sloped steep enough to allow the water to flow freely.

,
If you want to create a waterfall, build steps into the foundation of your stream, (30cm in height).

,
At the base of each step, dig a small hole (15cm) to sink your pond liner into thereby creating a small pool where the water can fill up and flow over to the lower step.

,
You’ll need a strong enough water-pump (we used 2500 Gph) to pump the water up from your pond through a hose (we used 20mm for extra propulsion) into the top-pool which will feed the water down into your stream.

,
After you’ve constructed the foundation, run the pond liner up from your pond through the stream foundation, finishing in the top-pool.,
It’s best to fit the liner with plenty of overlap on all sides of your foundation.

,
Before you trim the liner to size be sure to fill your stream with water to see how rapidly your water flows and check for possible holes in the lining.

,
Run the hose from your pond water pump up to the top-tool, carefully hide the hose under the liner and be sure to check for kinks, again check your flow of water before covering over the hose and liner.

,
Once the liner is in place, secure and bed down the edges with soil, be sure to choose soil conducive to plant growth.

,
If you have added steps to your stream you can build out the steps with garden slate allowing the edge of the slate to overhang creating a waterfall effect, the slate also hides the liner underneath.

,
Use good size rocks.,
You can cover the excess liner and soil with small stones (we used bags of ‘gold light’) and decorate the area with driftwood, logs, slate, granite and beach stones.

,
Planting is where the real fun begins, border and embellish your water feature with a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants, we used water grass, water lilies, Japanese maple, ferns, alpine saxifrage.

,
Add some creative lighting.,
Let it grow.",How to Build a Stream,";
,,,,,


Careful and precise fitting of the pond liner is probably the most important part of the entire process.

,,,,,, Garden rocks and stones don’t only add a great feature to your stream they help to weigh down your liner so don’t be afraid to use heavy ones.

,,, We all know how glorious it is sit out by your pond on a summer’s day but you can make it equally beautiful by night, all one needs is some creative lighting to illuminate your garden and water feature, simple tea-lights and floating oil burners should do the trick.

, While it’s important to maintain and manage your garden pond and stream, it’s just as important to ‘let your garden grow’. Do the hard work and planting early in the season and sit back and enjoy the rewards through the summer.

Select the ideal location for your waterfall.,
Map out your waterfall.,
Dig the stream bed.,
Construct your above-ground waterfall.,
Construct the lower basin.,
Fabricate the pump system.,
Construct the main waterfall.,
Fabricate the upper-chamber assembly.,
Lay in the liner.,
Position the stones.,
Wash the rocks with a gentle spray from your garden hose.",How to Build a Backyard Waterfall," Put your waterfall in a spot where in can be enjoyed from different angles, both inside your home and out.;
, Decide the size and orientation of your backyard waterfall system. The longer your stream bed, the more waterfalls you can add along its length. Figure on at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of grade per 10 feet (3.05 m) of stream. If you want faster-moving water and richer sound, make the grade steeper.

, Make your stream bed roughly 3 feet (0.9 m) (0.91 m) wide and at least a few inches deep. Cut in deeper troughs under the waterfalls, equal to the distance of the drop. These small pools help to slow water flow. Use a staircase effect when digging the grade. This will make the water travel downstream more efficiently.

, If digging in your yard is impossible, you can build an above-ground unit. These can be harder to build than in-ground versions because they require much more structural integrity to support the weight of the water. Use a waterproof silicone adhesive to stick rocks together. Foam sealants that expand after application can help fortify the waterfall liner, as well.

, The lower basin, or pond, must be built carefully. This is where the system's submersible pump will be. Make sure your pond area is at least 1 foot (0.30 m) (0.31 m) wider than the stream. Dig a hole at least 2 feet (0.61 m) wider than the pump enclosure and 6 inches deeper than its height.

,


Cut 3 or 4 holes on opposite sides of the pump enclosure. This allows water to reach the pump. Insert fabric underlayment and then rubber liner in the pond, allowing for slack in the pump basin. Make sure about 2 excess feet (0.61 m) of both materials extend from the enclosure. Put the pump basin in the deep hole you dug in the pond area.
Attach the hose adapter to the submersible pump. Insert a rubber washer that is the same diameter as the adapter end between the 2 connections. Thread the adapter to the pump. Apply waterproof silicone adhesive to the connection to ensure that it is watertight.
Attach the hose to the adapter. Secure the connection with a hose clamp.
Slide the pump in the enclosure. Make sure your hose is long enough to reach the water chamber in the upper pool.

, Arrange large boulders to frame the waterfall, then build a small, semicircular shelf to house the upper pool. Make the first drop the highest to ensure optimum flow, but make sure the water doesn't splatter.

,


Use a heavy-duty, 3-sided plastic storage bin to serve as the upper pool. Make sure the tapered, open end of the bin faces outward from the shelf you built.
Drill a hole on the side of the bin where the hose will be attached. Make sure the size of the hole matches the diameter of the hose adapter.
Slip the hose adapter through the hole. Put a rubber washer on the end of the adapter that extends inside the bin. Seal it with the silicone adhesive.
Fit the end of the hose on the other end of the adapter. Add a steel lock-nut to the connection and secure it with a hose clamp.

, Extend sections of underlayment and liner from the pond to the upper basin. Leave a few inches of slack where each waterfall will be. These points require larger stones, which can tear the liner if it's stretched too tight. Make sure sections of liner overlap ones downstream by about 11/2 feet (0.46 m). The liners must extend 2 feet (0.61 m) (0.61 m) up along the banks and pond basin.

, Boulders, rocks and gravel fulfill decorative and functional needs in a backyard waterfall system. You can order them from a garden supplier or quarry. Make sure the company will deliver the load to your home.


Boulders: More than 1,500 pounds of 2-foot boulders are needed for every 10 feet (3 m) (3.05 m) of stream bed. These provide the bulk of the upper-chamber framework and line the pond. They also help conceal large sections of hose, power cords and liners.
Stones: You might need upwards of 1,000 of medium-sized rocks and stones to line the banks. Flat stones are ideal for waterfall drop-offs, as they allow water to flow efficiently and provide a soothing, babbling-brook sound. Treat the underside of flat stones with foam sealant so they adhere to the rubber liner.
Gravel: You might need more than 2,000 pounds of gravel to meet the requirements of a 10-foot (3.05 m) stream bed. Gravel is used every section of the construction. It covers much of the stream bed and helps filter the water as it circulates through the system. Pack gravel and dirt around large stones to keep them in place.

, This will dislodge dirt and other debris. Then add water to the pond basin. When water fills the pond, start up the pump and let the system run. The rocks and pebbles will help aerate and purify the water, so after a while, the pond should look clearer.

Build the foot valve assembly.,
Build the plunger assembly.,
Identify how much connecting pipe is needed.,
Build the pump head assembly.,
Build the handle and lever arm.,
Protect the PVC pipe.,
Understand how the pump works.",How to Build a Water Hand Pump1," The purpose of the foot valve is to allow water into the cylinder without allowing it to fall back out. (The cylinder is the lower pipe section containing the foot valve and plunder assemblies.) It is composed of, from bottom to top:


a. 2in cap (not shown)
b. 2in pipe screen with drilled holes (about 9in long)
c. 2in coupler
d. 2x3/4 reducer
e. 2x3/4 reducer with the lip filed out to allow the 3/4in pipe to slide all the way through.
f. 2in coupler (not shown in assembled image)
g. 3/4in pipe (about 4 in long)
h. 3/4in slip-male thread adapter
i. 3/4in brass check valve
j. 2in pipe about 36in long (not shown). It fits into coupler (f).;
, The plunger serves two purposes. First, it provides a seal with the cylinder to generate suction. Second, it contains a second check valve to allow water in the upper cylinder.


a. 3/4in threaded pipe extender. Screws into bottom of check valve (d).
b. Spacers. The purpose of the spacers is to keep the gasket rigid. They should not contact the cylinder. You can use a 2in hole saw to score a ring in each side, then use a 1-1/8in Forstner bit to bore out the inner hole. The hole saw can be again used to finish the outer cut. These can be made from wood or plastic.
c. Leather gasket. Can also be made from rubber. Carefully cut this to fit snugly in the cylinder and on the pipe extender. When inserting the assembly in the cylinder to test the fit, first soften the leather with water. Otherwise, you will trim it too small and need to start over.
d. 3/4in brass check valve
e. 3/4in slip-male thread adapter
f. 3/4in pipe 6in long with drilled holes. This allows water to enter the upper cylinder after passing through the check valve.
g. 3/4x1/2in slip reducer
h. Rubber stopper. Held in place by the 1/2in pipe (i). Prevents water coming up the pipe (i).
i. 1/2in pipe

, Pipe is needed to connect the cylinder to a pump head and the plunger to a handle at the surface. The amount of pipe depends on the depth of the static water level in the well. From the top of the cylinder, you can reduce the pipe down to a 1-1/4in diameter pipe to save on cost and weight. However, it does increase the force required to pull the water to the surface (hydraulic principles).


Before measuring the static water depth and well depth, first remove the well cap. This will reveal a secondary cap and the electrical connections. This cap is cemented to a pipe which connects to the pitless adapter (the device that holds the pump in place and connects the water from the pump to the line leading to the house below the frost level). You do not need to remove this cap or lift the pump at this time, as you only need to measure the static water depth.
To measure the static water depth, tie a weight to some string or light rope. It is difficult to hear or see when the weight enters the water. Therefore, lower the weight down a few feet and bring it back up, feeling for water on the rope. Continue lowering the rope a couple feet further each time, until the rope comes up wet. Each time, mark the rope at the top of the well before pulling the rope out. Measure the distance from the weight to highest mark on the rope. This is the static water depth.
Measuring the total depth of the well is more of a challenge because it is difficult to know when you hit bottom (or the top of the pump). Using fishing line may be helpful.
Nevertheless, the static water depth is the important measurement. This indicates how much pipe (both the 1-1/4in outer pipe and the 1/2in inner pipe) is needed. To cover the 15 feet (4.6 m), and have the cylinder well below the static water level, use 20 feet (6.1 m) of pipe. The pipe will be connected with threaded couplers to aid in assembly and disassembly without cement.
One additional detail to mention here is to drill a small hole in the side of the 1-1/4in pipe a few feet below the ground level. This will slowly drain water from the top of the pipe back into the well and thus prevent freeze damage.

, The pump head diverts the water coming up from the well out to a spigot. The 1/2in pipe from the plunger extends up to pump head and through the top where a handle is attached to operate the pump.


a. 1-1/4x1/2in reducer. Ream out the bore with a 7/8in Forstner bit to allow the 1/2in pipe to slide freely.
b. 1-1/4x3/4in threaded T coupler.
c. 3/4in slip-male thread adapter

g. 3/4x1/2in slip-male thread reducer (optional)
h. Brass female pipe, male hose adapter (optional)


To prevent water seeping up through the 1-1/4x1/2in reducer (a) around the pipe handle a gasket (b) needs to be inserted. A washer (c) holds the gasket tight to the reducer and a 3/4x1/2in reducer (d) (cut short and reamed out) is cemented into the reducer (a) to hold the washer and gasket in place.







, At the top of the 1/2in pipe, a T handle can be added for direct manipulation of the pump. A lever handle can also be attached to the pump head assembly if needed for deeper wells.


You might also add to your to-do list an alternative well cap that will accept the pump head assembly.

, UV rays from the sun will make PVC pipe brittle and can weaken cemented joints. Any exposed PVC pipe can be spray painted with an opaque paint to protect against this effect.

, When the pump handle is pulled up, water is drawn in to the lower cylinder through the foot valve. When the pump handle is pushed down the water is forced through the check valve above the plunger and into the upper cylinder. When the pump is pulled up again, water is pulled in through the foot valve, and also the water that was pushed into the upper cylinder in the previous cycle is pulled up to the surface.

"

Make an alternative pump operation if needed.,
Be aware that you may prefer the original design for the following reasons:


You may not want the water coming out of the handle.,
Make alternative pipe configuration.",How to Build a Water Hand Pump2," With the configuration described above, water is lifted to the surface when the handle is pulled up. If not using a lever handle, this may be awkward and/or difficult as you are relying entirely on your arm muscles to lift the water. The pump can be reconfigured to push the water on the down stroke, which would leverage your body weight. To accomplish this, simply connect the 1/2in pipe handle directly to the brass check valve above the plunger. In this configuration, the water will go up the handle and thus require a completely different pump head. (One option is to connect a hose to the T handle used to operate the pump.)

,
You might plan to use a lever handle (which pulls the water up when you push down on the handle).
The force of pushing down on the 1/2in pipe to do the work may lead to buckling issues.
The water in the pipe must still be pulled up to the surface with the alternative design.
The alternative assumes the cylinder above the plunger is dry. There is a good chance the gasket will not form a perfect seal and leak water into the chamber anyway.
It is not as easy to drain water from the internal pipe to prevent freeze damage.

, Another alternative design uses a rigid pusher rod rather than the 1/2in pipe (which could also be employed in the original design above) and a separate supply pipe to the surface. This design uses more materials, may not fit in most wells, and the pump head may be more complicated. This option operates just like the previous one. The only difference is the water pipe and pusher rod are separated."

Gather your supplies.,
Assemble your fountain parts.,
Adjust water flow.,
Enjoy your fountain.",How to Make an Outdoor Fountain," Decide where you want to place your fountain, how large you want it to be and how you want it to look. These factors will all influence what materials you will need.


Your fountain will be composed of three main elements: a water reservoir, a water pump and a design feature.
The location must have easy access to an electrical outlet or the ability to run an unobtrusive extension cord to power the pump






The style is up to you. Go for something that works well with your existing landscaping and suits your personal taste.;
,


A Reservoir. This can be any type of water-tight container, such as a plastic tub or even plastic sheeting lining your reservoir hole if building underground. If building above ground, consider making the reservoir part of the design, such as half a wine barrel, as long as it will hold water.
A Water pump. Pumps can be purchased from most home improvement or landscape supply stores. You will need a pump with enough power (measured in gallons per second) to push the water up to the fountainhead. Since this will vary based on your design, it is best to consult with someone with knowledge of pumps before purchasing.
Pipes and tubing. The pipes or tubing will deliver the water from the reservoir to the fountainhead. Many water pumps will come with tubing, but if not, or if you need something specific for your design (such as copper pipe), you will need to purchase it separately. Rubber tubing will be the easiest to work with.
Design features. These elements will depend entirely on your design, such as river stones or a sculpted fountainhead. If your fountainhead of choice does not already have a hole, you may need to drill one.

,

If building below ground, dig a hole that will fit the water reservoir snugly. Be sure to leave 2 inches (5 cm) of drainage gravel beneath the reservoir. If you wish to hide the power cord, you will need to dig a separate trench out from the reservoir hole.






Fit the pump in the reservoir before adding water. Ensure all tubing and power connections fit and function properly.






Add your design elements. The water pump should remain accessible for adjustment, repair and cleaning, either by leaving an opening or door, or with easy disassembly.






Fill the fountain with enough clean water to fully submerge the water pump and keep it submerged while in operation when water will be cycling through the upper part of the fountain.







, Turn on water pump (adjusting pressure if needed) and arrange the fountain's design elements to ensure the water returns to the reservoir. The look and sound of the fountain can also be adjusted this way by tweaking the angle of the fountainhead and any obstacles in the path of the water flow.

, Hide any rough spots or visible mechanisms with design features such as stones or plants.

Things to check:


Make sure all stainless steel clamps have been tightened before backfilling.",How to Build a Natural Looking Waterfall With a Filtrific Vanishing Water System," When mapping out the path of your water feature, consider bends in the stream and waterfall drops. A natural looking stream channel should appear “ageless,” as if it has always been there. To best accomplish this, choose a location with a slope. If you don’t have much of a slope to work with, as an alternative you can choose to create water flowing from a boulder or rock grouping. You can also create a subtle rise in elevation with a well planted landscape berm or rock out-croppings that blur the transition from flat to slope.
Note: Make sure that the water feature is following the appropriate length and width determined by the selected system. It is crucial to follow the size restraints for sufficient water storage. To ensure accurate length and width during excavation you can use tools such as marking paint to mark the determined path.


Select a Spot for the Filter Tank. In this installation the Filter Tank can be located remotely from the end of the water feature. In relation to the end, the top of the Filter Tank can be placed even with the ground level around the water feature (at grade) or it can be placed downhill from the water feature (below grade)
Choose the Intake Route. The Filter Tank can be positioned as needed to avoid an obstacle, keep it out of the lawn, or be best aligned with additional water storage tanks. The intake route is that of the pipe between the Fixed Skimmer and the Filter Tank. With this type of system you can place the Filter Tank away from the water feature enabling you to customize your intake route to best fit your landscape.
Common Intake Positioning: Intake routes for 4” IPS pipe (up to 80 GPM) and 6” IPS pipe (up to 200 GPM) can have the intake pipe run straight and level up to 50 feet (10ft less per bend).;
,


Option 1: End in a stream. To end your water feature as shown below to the left, excavate 6” deep at the same width as the stream.
Option 2: End in a Vanishing pool. Excavate 9” deep to allow a 3” deep vanishing pool. If there is a waterfall above this, the length of this area should be at least 1-1/2 times the drop of the waterfall to contain the waterfall splash. For installations using the T390F Filter Tank, excavate 10” deep to allow a 4” deep vanishing pool.

, The skimmer pocket is located at the end of the water feature. (Refer to the Photo on the right)

, (Refer to the Photo on the right)

, Excavate the Stream Channel. A natural looking stream shows signs of erosion from years of water carving a path through the landscape. Avoid a “flying stream look” where water runs over the surface or appears elevated without any aging or character. The following instruction is a general reference to keep the water flow within the stream channel and help you build a natural looking water feature. While excavated depths will vary with each installation, the excavated stream depth should never be less than 6” deep. The excavated depth should increase where the stream drops. This will not only keep the flow of water within the stream, but also create the illusion that the water feature is a natural part of the landscape, not an addition to it.

, Depending on how the rocks will stack up – the top spill rock can rest (A) on the top of the step, (B) rest on a slightly notched shelf, or (C) for short drops, simply extend up an inch or two in front of the step.
Thick weir rocks may require a slightly recessed shelf to reduce the thickness of the weir. The back of the weir should match the gravel depth being placed in the stream channel.

, Excavate a Shelf for the Waterfall Starter


Choose option A or B.

, Make sure the excavated channel is free of rocks, sticks and roots that could puncture the liner. Where several layers of rocks will be stacked, a slight amount of wetted sand can be added to make a smoother subsurface.
Lay the fabric underlayment. Excess fabric should be used for cushioning large rock placements.

,


Lay the rubber liner over the fabric. Be sure that no rocks fall between the layer of underlayment and the liner, as this could damage the liner and possibly cause a leak.
Center the liner from top to bottom and from side to side. Don’t be in a hurry to cut off the excess liner, as it can be trimmed later. Always allow a little extra liner to overhang the sides. Up to 6” of excess liner can easily be folded under as the final rocks are being placed.
Avoid making lateral folds that can traverse water over the side wall. Keep in mind that all water that laps or splashes against a sidewall must be able to flow back into the channel. Be very attentive to this when placing the rocks.
Waterfall drops bunch and gather liner from the sides, so give yourself plenty of liner to work with in these areas.

,, Cut off the ports that you plan to use, either before or after placing the Filter Tank.

, Now that you have established where finish grade will be around the water feature you can excavate for the Filter Tank. Dig the hole so the top rim of the Filter Tank is level with the lowest edge of the water feature. Note: When excavating make sure to plan for the Filter Tank and any Expansion Tanks. Make sure the Filter Tank and any Expansion Tanks will fit within the excavated area with about 6” of room for connection fittings.


Allow room for 1” of compacted sand below the Filter Tank. This cushions the bottom of the Filter Tank and also makes leveling easier.

,, Connect the Filter Tank to any additional Expansion Tanks. The Filter Tank (shown right) has an Expansion Tank connection port on the front of the tank.

, If the Filter Tank is level with the water feature, dig the intake trench so the pipe will be level.
Below Grade:

When the top of the Filter Tank is placed lower than the rim of the vanishing pool, the rim of the pool becomes your reference point. To find the penetration point of the intake pipe, measure down 8-3/4” for 4” and 6” pipe and 10-3/4” for 10” pipe. Elbow down accordingly to connect to the Filter Tank intake port.
Place the Flex-Coupling over the intake port and tighten the stainless steel clamp.
Insert the intake pipe into the coupling and tighten the stainless steel clamp.



, Note: Allow an expansion fold below the pipe.
With scissors, cut out the traced circle from the liner.
Stretch the liner over the pipe; this creates a tight sleeve band around the pipe.
Place the flex-collar over the rubber band and tighten.
Connect the Flex-Coupling to the pipe.
Insert the skimmer outlet to the Flex-Coupling.

, Then firmly backfill over the intake pipe so that it will stay level when it comes time to fill the system with water.

,, At the top of the stream repeat “Connecting to Liner” (section 6-2 and 6-3, steps 1-5) using the smaller tracing disc and 3” pipe included in the Waterfall Starter Kit. Step 6: Insert the Waterfall Starter outlet to the Flex-Coupling.

, Place rock on top of the Waterfall Starter so the source of water is hidden.

, At each waterfall drop, place a strip of concrete over the extended fabric to force the water flow over the weir rocks.

, The overflow allows excess rainwater to go out of the overflow rather then puddling up at the base of the water feature.


How the Overflow Works: When the system is turned off, water in the stream refills the Filter Tank and Expansion Tanks to the bottom of the “Overflow” port. Rainwater will replenish any evaporation loss until the water level in the Filter Tank rises to the bottom of the overflow. Excess Rainwater will now flow out the overflow to prevent a standing pool of water from developing over the top of the gravel when the system is not in use.
Drain Options.
Drain to Daylight. Route the overflow pipe to drain onto an existing slope. This is suggested when you have a slope in your landscape that supports excess water run off.
Drain to Storm Drain. If you can’t drain to above ground, tie the overflow pipe into an existing yard drain or downspout drain.
Note: If neither of the above options are possible, excess Rainwater can be drained into a gravel swamp at a location away from the Filter Tank.

, Make sure the intake pipe has been backfilled. If you are installing an optional Auto-Fill or Pump Shut-Off, these should be positioned (see section 10) before adding water. Fill the system to the bottom of your overflow and turn the pump on.

, Water should return to the Filter Tank before all the water is pumped out of the tank. If you run out of water this indicates you are short on containment. If you intend to turn the system off regularly, additional water storage should be added (Expansion Tanks).

, Adjust the Skimmer Height. Trim or lower the skimmer as needed to accommodate the pumping volume. You do not want the operating water level flowing over the top of the liner. The operating water level should be no closer than 2” from the top of the liner.
To Lower the Skimmer. The Fixed Skimmer is designed to be lowered in two ways. The Eccentric Coupling can be rotated to lower the operating water level (A), and for high flows the Fixed Skimmer opening can also be cut down (B). Either or both of these adjustments will lower the operating level of the vanishing pool.
To Raise the Skimmer. To raise the skimming depth, simply rotate the Eccentric Coupling.

, The Fixed Skimmer can be hidden with natural elements or finished with a Stainless Steel Grate (use the riser kit if there will be leaves falling into the stream).

,
Make sure all water flowing down the stream is contained within the liner.
Make sure there is at least 2” between the top of the liner and the operating level of the Vanishing Pool. If not, raise the liner accordingly, shorten the height of the skimmer, or reduce the pumping volume.
Make sure that the system can be turned off and then turned back on without having to add water.
Make sure that the terrain around the Filter Tank is graded so surface water does not collect around it.

Health food stores and health-oriented/eco-friendly supermarkets

Local stores where the people know you already
Places that already have some green shopping practices in place, such as not giving out plastic bags, etc.;
, It is important that whatever container you are using is clearly suitable for the purpose. Make sure that it is:


Obviously clean
Can be easily weighed
Can effectively and safely contain the item of food or produce that you want to purchase.

, Ask if it is OK to use your own container and show it to the person in question.


If they cannot provide an answer, ask who can and then ask to see that person. Always seek the person who can say ""yes"", or who is at least in a position to consider changing a store policy.

, For example, if an item needs to be weighed, suggest that they weigh your container first, keep a record of that, and then have you return for a new weigh-in with the item inside the container. From there, you can detract the weight of the container and just pay for the item's weight.


Have the container weighed, then multiply the weight of the container by the cost per pound or kilo of your bulk item.

Instead, be confident of your request, and ask politely, assuming nothing but feeling confident that your request is able to be accommodated.

, Your fear of being embarrassed or of coming across as an awkward or bizarre customer may be what is holding you back from making the request to use your own containers. Try not to think of it that way. Instead, consider the following important realities:


You are laying the groundwork for the next shopper who wants reduced/no packaging. You might be a trailblazer but you will be alerting the store to a new and future possibility that it will need to come to terms with eventually, as more and more people demand less and less packaging.
If you're feeling embarrassed, realize that other people probably are feeling that way too, and that by asking now, you are helping to educate retailers and their staff how to handle this request effectively and with respect.

, Tell the store that it is important to you that you don't use excess packaging, particularly plastic products. You can provide particular examples of why it is so important, if wished, such as the ocean trash gyres, but don't go into excessive detail!

, Too few people do, perhaps because we still feel constrained to ""not make a fuss"". Yet, we have so many amazing tools to help us communicate better while still being considerate of others. Rely on assertive language and give it your best shot.

Insulate your home.,
Upgrade your windows.,
Use Energy Star appliances.,
Replace your light bulbs.,
Wash your clothes in cold water.,
Make the most of sunlight.,
Set your thermostat wisely.,
Unplug your electronics.",How to Be Green at Home1," Nearly half of your home’s energy expenditures come from heating and cooling. To reduce the amount of heating and cooling needed, it is important for your home to be well-insulated. Ideally your home would be well-insulated when it was built, but this is not always the case. To improve your home’s insulation, hang thermal curtains over your windows. Curtains can go a long way in keeping out the cold or heat, depending on the season.When choosing curtains, pick a fun pattern or an elegant design so that they are a piece of decor for your home as well. They will look great and keep your home insulated to cut down on your heating or cooling bill.
If there are any gaps or places where you notice air getting in, be sure to seal these. Buy some caulk from a hardware store to seal the edges. If you aren’t comfortable doing this yourself, hire a professional to help.;
, Much of a home’s heat or air conditioning escapes through windows. When your old windows need upgrading, install energy-efficient windows. They are typically double-paned for lower levels of air leakage. Look into their energy performance ratings to see which ones will fit your needs and best cut down on your energy consumption. Make sure they are properly installed so that they perform correctly.Energy-efficient windows vary greatly in terms of quality and price. On the low end, you can find them for about $100/window, which will usually have a vinyl frame. These can still be a good option and work well to reduce air leakage. On the higher end, they can cost $1000+ and can have frames of vinyl, wood, aluminum, or wood-clad.To install windows, hire an expert, either an experienced contractor or a window professional. Oftentimes, you can have someone install them from the place where you buy them. Window installation requires a certain level of expertise that often goes beyond a general handyman.

, When it is time for new appliances, look for ones that are Energy Star certified. These will save you money in the long run by requiring less energy to run them. Most appliances are available Energy Star certified, from refrigerators to dishwashers to washers and dryers. You don’t need to replace all of them at once, but even upgrading one of your appliances can make your home more green., This is a simple and inexpensive way to be green at home. You need lightbulbs so you might as well use the ones that are efficient. Choose compact fluorescent bulbs (CFL), which use about 75% less electricity and last about 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs. They convert energy to light rather than to heat for optimal and efficient lighting., That way, no heating is required. Cold water still does a good job of cleaning your clothes, it keeps colors from running, and it eliminates heating energy. For laundry, be sure to wait until you have a full load so that you aren’t wasting water either.

, If you are able to, install solar panels. This is a great option that can even allow you to live off-the-grid. However, this option isn’t for everyone. Some locations don’t get enough sunlight for this to be effective and the upfront costs of installation can be high, although it does save money in the long run because you eliminate other bills.


If you aren’t able to install solar panels, you can still benefit from sunlight. To warm up your home, open the curtains where the sun will enter. With the warm sun pouring in, that room will raise several degrees without requiring any energy consumption.

, You might have learned that room temperature is 72 degrees. While this might be ideal, it isn’t necessary and, depending on your climate, might require a great deal of heating and cooling. In warm summer months, try keeping your home at 78 degrees and in cold winter months, keep your home at 68 degrees during the day and 55 degrees at night. If you bundle up with a down blanket and some fleece, you will sleep soundly and won’t even notice the cooler temperature.If you are too hot in summer months, try misting some cold water on your face, using an energy efficient fan, and wearing thin clothing.

Opt for reusable items instead of single use.,
Make a compost pile.,
Aim for only one bag of trash per month.,
Go paper-free when possible.,
Reduce wasted water.,
Repurpose old items.",How to Be Green at Home2," A lot of items that people throw out can be easily recycled. Some places even offer free recycling services. Most plastic containers, glass jars, tin cans, and paper can be recycled. It’s just as easy as throwing it in your garbage. Simply place it in your recycling bin instead. This will greatly reduce waste in landfills and will allow your items to be reused instead of wasted.

, This goes for clothing, electronics, appliances, and furniture. Your junk is someone else’s treasure. Simply take items to a Goodwill facility, sell them online, or give to a friend or family member. Try not to throw any of this out unless it is completely useless. If you outgrow a shirt, someone else will gladly wear it, especially someone in need. This is a great way to help other people and take care of the environment.Be especially mindful of electronics. Many people have old cells phones lying around or multiple computers and tablets. It is very important not to simply throw these out. There are recycling facilities specifically for your electronics if you aren’t able to donate or sell them.

, It is very hard on our planet to have people upgrading their phones every few months or buying a new jacket every season. A lot of energy, resources, and waste result from each item that is made. Try to pick out a few nice items that will last you a long time as opposed to buying something new every few months. This will help you to avoid throwing things out and will greatly help our planet., Instead of plastic water bottles, buy a reusable stainless steel one. Instead of a paper coffee cup each day, use in a reusable mug. Instead of paper towels, use a cloth towel. Instead of paper or plastic dishes, use ceramic ones. This way you aren’t continually buying and throwing things out, but are instead reusing a single item. This greatly helps to cut back on waste and is a simple way to go green., Instead of throwing out old scraps of food, you can compost them. This way they will break down into good useful soil instead of sitting in a landfill for a long time. To make your own, you need to combine brown matter (leaves, dried grass, wood chips, twigs) and green matter (vegetable peels, coffee grounds, tea leaves, apple cores, egg shells). Place them in a covered bin with many holes in it. Mix them together and let them sit.


It takes several weeks (or even months if it is cold out) for the items to compost and you can continue adding scraps while you wait. This cuts back on waste and will help with your gardening!

, To see how you are doing with eliminating waste, set a goal of only filling up one garbage bag each month. If you are recycling your goods and composting your organic material, you might be surprised how little waste you create! Feel free to adjust this based on the size of your family, but one bag per month is a good goal to aim for.


Even if you just cut back on a bag of trash each month, you will still make a big difference.

, These days, a lot of waste can be eliminated by choosing paper-free options. You can pay bills and receive bank statements online. You can use ebooks rather than buying print books. You can read articles on your computer instead of buying printed versions. There are very few things that absolutely need to be printed out. You can even use airplane tickets from your phone!, Install an efficient shower head and try to take quick showers. Five minutes should be all you need. Try to shower every other day instead of daily or try to only wash your hair a couple of times per week. You can give yourself a quick sponge bath in the morning instead of a full shower. That way you will be clean and will preserve water.Turn off the water while brushing your teeth. It doesn’t need to run the whole time!
Fix any leaky faucets. A few droplets might not seem like much, but this can quickly add up.

, Instead of throwing out an old chair that is no longer in style, you can repurpose it. Try decorating it with a couple of throw pillows or placing an elegant cover over it. You could even have it reupholstered for a brand new look. A lot of older items simply need a nice new finish to be brought up to date. And a lot will eventually come back in style! Get creative or hire someone to help you update your items instead of tossing them.

Eat organic foods.,
Grow your own herbs or vegetables.,
Visit a farmer’s market.,
Eat whole foods.,
Avoid harsh chemicals.,
Make your own products.",How to Be Green at Home3," Look for the USDA Organic label to be sure that foods were grown according to proper standards. Organic foods are free from dangerous pesticides and chemicals, which can harm your health and the planet. If you don’t have the budget to buy all organic foods, switch out a couple of items like grapes or spinach that are known to have a high pesticide content., This is a great way to ensure they will be chemical free. Try growing a few pots of herbs in your house. They will taste great and also help keep your air clean. If you’re feeling ambitious, plant a small vegetable garden outside. There is nothing quite like fresh produce or the satisfaction of enjoying the fruits of your labor., If you don’t have a green thumb, you can benefit from those that do. Buy your food from a local farmer’s market to support farmers and good agricultural practices. Fresh food tastes better, is healthier, and helps the environment by eliminating shipping the food which causes a lot of pollution., Try to avoid foods filled with chemicals and instead opt for natural ingredients such as whole grains, beans, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and spices. If you can’t pronounce it, you probably don’t want to ingest it! Take the time to read the label. Just because it is advertised as natural, doesn’t mean it actually is.


Try to limit your meat consumption. Raising meat takes a great toll on the environment. If you currently eat meat daily, try to choose one day a week to go vegetarian. Every little bit helps., A lot of cleaning supplies are filled with toxic chemicals. You don’t want to kill germs by exposing yourself to another harmful element! Instead choose cleaning supplies with natural ingredients. These are much better for the environment by greatly reducing toxic waste. Try a simple Castile soap or use baking soda and vinegar. These will keep your home clean, safe, and will also save you money.Check the ingredients of your hygiene products. A lot of makeup, deodorants, shampoos, soaps, and toothpastes are also filled with harsh chemicals. Since these are used daily, it is especially important to use quality ingredients. There are many ingredients to look out for, but a good starting point would be to avoid parabens, fragrance, synthetic colors, and phthalates., When in doubt, make it yourself, that way you know exactly what is in it and can tailor it to your specific needs. Whether it is enjoying a home-cooked meal or making your own deodorant, when you make it yourself it is generally healthier, less expensive, and better for the environment.


Start by choosing one item you’d like to try making for yourself. It might take a couple of tries to get the recipe just right. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't go perfectly the first time. Once you master one recipe, try making something else.

Do your research.,
Decide what you need from your dwelling and what you want from your dwelling.,
Look at the benefits of ""living small:"" less space to clean; less pack-ratting of unneeded clothes, broken appliances, etc.,
Realize that small houses cost more per square feet than large houses.,
Decide if you will build your own home from plans, or if you will buy an already made home new, or if you will buy a used home.,
Pare down your belongings: we spend about 80% of our time wearing 20% of the clothes we own, so by getting rid of most of that wasted 80%, your life becomes immediately simpler: less laundry and less indecision about what to wear that day.,
Be creative about storage and multi-function furniture: a bed platform could have clothing storage drawers underneath.",How to Start Living in a Tiny House," There are many types of tiny homes, from as small as 9 square feet up to 837 square feet. Look at the designs, which range from traditional to ultra-modern in design. Some incorporate off-the-grid designs like solar/wind power, rainwater collection, and composting toilets.;
, Most people need a comfortable, dry, quiet place to sleep; a clean place to perform personal hygiene (toilet, shower); a comfortable place to sit or lie down during the day; a place to store, prepare, and eat food for the day. You may want other creature comforts such as long-term refrigerated food storage, a clothes washer and dryer etc. But think of combining these appliances in one machine. Do you really need a dryer or could you dry your clothes outside?

,; lower energy bills and a greener environmental footprint; fresher food that is purchased, caught, or harvested on a more daily basis; more time available for outdoor activities and entertaining; no need to sell your home when you relocate (if your tiny home is towable).

, Designing for smaller areas is more complex, as items such as built-in furniture have to be custom made to take advantage of all the space. Compact appliances sometimes cost much more than full sized appliances. If you are designing or building your own home on a trailer bed, you need to take plumbing (grey water and black water storage and disposal) into consideration.

, There are also ""kits"" available which come with all or most of the supplies for building the house, along with instructions. The cheapest option for small living is to buy a well-maintained used RV or travel trailer. Craigslist usually will have several listings under $5000. You get the advantage of having something already designed and constructed, but you have the disadvantage of not being able to fully customize your home to your needs and wants.

, Instead of having 3 TVs, 2 computers, a VCR, DVD, Blu-Ray, and 3 different game stations, reduce to one computer--transfer your movies to a hard drive and a flat screen monitor can double as a TV. A laptop with a TV tuner is even more energy efficient.

, If you make a built-in sofa (without a bed) you can use the space underneath to store lots of things. A table can be made with shelves for storage underneath the table surface. Or you could design a table that folds out of the wall, then folds up and down to become a bed. Use broad, deep shelves (including built-in) and drawers, and wall and ceiling mounted items, to minimize the proportion of wasted space above, below, and around the edges of items (due to packing geometry or falling-off-the-edge risk). Consider metal furniture to reduce the amount of space consumed by the furniture itself.

Don’t wash your car that often.",How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint," Compact fluorescents save more than 2/3rds the amount of energy of regular light bulbs. You can reduce the carbon footprint of your home by switching to these energy saving bulbs. However, it is important to remember that some fluorescent bulbs contain mercury—when you are buying your bulbs, look for ones with a label that says low-mercury., Another great way to save energy is to minimize the amount of air leaking out of your home. Make sure that your walls are insulated. You could also consider double paneling your windows—this can be rather costly, but it will save you money in the long run when you do end up heating or cooling your home.


You should also add some caulking or weather stripping around windows and doors. This will help you to eliminate drafts, thus making your heating and cooling systems more energy efficient.

, This means both buying electronics with a good energy rating, and making sure that you unplug your electronics when you are not using them. Look for an Energy Star label on any appliance you consider buying. Energy Star is a certification given to appliance companies by the United States government. It signifies that the appliance is highly energy efficient. Regardless of how energy efficient your appliance might be, however, it is always good to unplug your appliances when you are not using them.If you have a hard time remembering to unplug your electronics, consider buying a power strip. You can plug your electronics into it, and shut them all off just by hitting the ‘off’ button on the power strip.

, Solar, hydro, and wind power are all excellent forms of alternative energy. Some utilities companies will give you the option of choosing green energy through the use of solar or wind power. If your utilities company doesn’t offer a green option, don’t give up! You can set up your own solar panels, and even build your own turbines.

, Instead of running the dryer every time you do a load of laundry, hang your clothes to dry in the sun instead. Set up your own clothesline. You can also air dry clothes on a rack indoors.

, One of the greenhouse gas contributors is the food industry. If you really want to lower your carbon footprint, prefer products that don’t have to be transported very far. Shop at farmer’s markets and natural food stores that carry products by local growers.


You should also make a point of only buying products that are in season. If you find that you are craving blueberries in the middle of winter, think about the fact that the only blueberries available to you will have been shipped from Chile. Instead, try to purchase seasonal items.

, Its hard to get more local than your own backyard. If you have the time and space to do so, you should really consider planting a garden. Think about planting things you know you will eat. If you use basil a lot, why not grow it? Any extra food that you grow but can’t eat can be donated to a local food charity.

, You should particularly avoid beef that has been shipped from far away. As crazy as this may sound, the livestock industry is actually accountable for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, methane is a big problem when it comes to cattle raising. You don't have to stop eating beef entirely, but consider saving it for special occasions. When you do eat beef, make sure that it is free-range and grass-fed, as this has both lower emissions and is better for the animal., Doing this will help you to reduce the amount of waste you are left with after your meal. If you have an option between several apples on a tray, wrapped in plastic wrap, and simply selecting unwrapped apples that you can put in your reusable bag--choose the unwrapped apples., When you can, take public transit or carpool with your coworkers. If you are traveling close enough to home, ride your bike (you’ll get in shape too!) or walk.


Learn to Get Back on a Bicycle As an Adult if it has been awhile.
You can carry a lot of cargo by bicycle, too.

, Whether you get there some other way, or skip trips by doing business online or by phone, you can probably figure out ways to put fewer miles on your vehicle than you do., You may not know this, but some of your driving habits actually affect how much CO2 your car emits. Accelerating smoothly and slowly, maintaining a steady, moderate speed while you drive, and anticipating your stops and starts will actually help you to save one ton of CO2 in a year.If you know you are going to be driving a lot, and have the funds to do so, you should consider purchasing a hybrid or all-electric car. Remember, though, that much electricity also has a carbon cost, and that electric cars don't cut down on traffic congestion.

, This means making sure your fuel, air, and oil filters are replaced when they need to be. When your car is running efficiently, your emission control systems should be working at the top of their game.To maximize your gas mileage, make sure that your tires are properly inflated.

, If you are traveling a relatively long distance, and have the time to do so, go by a train or bus, rather than by airplane. Airplanes pump out a lot of CO2 emissions. You can reduce your carbon footprint by trying other means of long-distance transportation.


If you do have to take a plane, look for a nonstop flight, rather than switching planes during a layover. This will not only reduce your air travel footprint, it will also be much more convenient for you.

, This goes for clothing, food products, household items--anything. Energy is consumed every time a new cotton shirt is made, or a bundle of bananas gets shipped.

For durable items, look around at garage sales and thrift stores, or check your local classified or Freecycle listing. Many people discard or sell serviceable items they were no longer using.
When you do have to buy new items, try to buy locally. Shipping products increases your carbon footprint. A five pound package shipped via air across the United States will produce 12 pounds of CO2 emissions. Try finding that item locally next time you hover your mouse over purchase while online shopping.







, How long will this item last you? Will it be obsolete in two years? Five? Will it be out of fashion? Will it break?, Instead of throwing things out that could end up in a landfill creating methane gas, reuse everything you can. Reupholster old chairs, rather than sending them to the dump. You can also reuse old clothes or sell them.

, It’s important to know what can and cannot be recycled. This varies from county to county, so run an online search to find out what rules govern your individual recycling system. Always remember to wash recyclables before putting them in the recycling bin. Remember to recycle your glass, aluminium, and paper.

, Food waste can be used to feed your garden. Compost enriches soil and cleans up contaminated soil. It also reduces the need for fertilizers, pesticides, and even water., Your town or county should have a hazardous waste facility located near you. Search online to find out where yours is located. These facilities will have drop off days or locations for single-use batteries. Rechargeable batteries can be dropped off at many different locations, including Staples and Radio Shack, which will properly dispose of them for you.You can also drop your old cell phones off along with your rechargeable batteries. Many electronics stores have partnered with Call2Recycle, a rechargeable battery and cell phone collection organization that recycles your old cells and batteries for you.

, Sadly, old electronics can’t just be placed in the recycle bin with your other recyclables. You can, however, take your electronics to a recycling center near you. Run an online search for recycling centers in your area., Not only do short showers save water, they also save the energy that it takes to heat that water up. You should also keep in mind that baths consume a lot more water than short showers do.


Choose water-conserving shower heads. According to National Geographic, if you use a low-flow showerhead, you can actually save 15 gallons (56.8 L) of water if you take a ten minute shower., Roughly 22% of home water consumption comes from laundry. Always make sure to put them on the right setting too. If you do wash a smaller load of laundry, make sure to activate the ‘small’ or ‘medium’ load setting. (Some washers, especially front-loading machines, automatically adjust the water level.)

, A lot of the water we consume is actually wasted because of leaks we may have in our systems. Do regular maintenance on your pipes, checking to make sure that you don’t have any leaks. If you do--repair them immediately so that less water gets wasted.

, It’s important to remember that not all climates are meant to have green grass in them. To really conserve water, fill your yard with plants that naturally thrive in your climate. You will find that you have relatively little landscaping work to do, which means you will be saving both water and energy., Washing a standard-sized vehicle generally takes about 150 gallons (567.8 L) of water. That is a lot of water. Try to reduce the number of times you wash your car. Consider bringing your car to a professional car wash. They generally use less water than a person washing their car at home. Commercial car washes are also required to drain their used water into the sewage system (rather than storm drains) so they have less of an impact on the marine environment."

Use cloth bags instead of plastic.,
Buy food that has less packaging.,
Do vermicomposting.,
Don't use bottled drinks unless you have to.,
Reduce your paper usage.,
Consider making your own household cleaners and detergents.,
Donate items when possible.,
Reuse containers.,
Follow your city's recycling policies.,
Dispose of trash and hazardous waste properly.,
Save your food scraps and yard cuttings from the trash.,
Create a compost site.,
Choose to make either a cold or hot compost heap.,
Maintain your compost site.,
Use your compost when it's ready.",How to Manage Your Home Waste," This small measure will greatly reduce the amount of waste you bring into your house. No matter where you're shopping, you can bring your own reusable cloth bags instead of accepting plastic bags from the store. Plan ahead by purchasing several reusable bags and storing them where you won't forget to bring them along next time you go shopping, like in your kitchen or in the trunk of your car.


If you forget to bring your cloth bags to the store, you can still reduce waste! Ask the person bagging your groceries not to use double bags. Most stores now sell cloth bags, so you could spring for those instead of accepting plastic or paper - you can never have enough around the house.
Using cloth bags isn't limited to grocery shopping. Take one along when you go shopping for clothes, tools, or any other items you may need.;
, If you tend to buy food that comes in boxes wrapped in plastic with individually-wrapped serving sizes inside, you're probably producing more waste than you want to. Look for ways to buy food with minimal packaging, especially plastic packaging, and you'll see your daily mound of garbage turn into a tiny hill. Here are a few tricks to try:


Use the bulk food section. You can buy rice, beans, cereals, teas, spices, and other dry foods in the bulk food section of your grocery store. Store the foods in airtight glass or plastic containers when you get home.

, You can make your own worm composting system.


Make dinner instead of heating it up. Take-out food and microwaveable dinners require a lot of packaging, and it all just goes in the trash. It definitely takes more time, but consider replacing some of your instant meals with homemade creations. Your waistline will thank you, too.
Buy dairy items in containers you can return. An increasing amount of dairy companies offer a return system in which you buy a glass jug of milk, cream or buttermilk and return the jug for a deposit. This is a great way to cut down on using plastic.
Buy from farmer's markets. They offer mounds of fresh produce that have never touched plastic. Bring along cloth bags to carry your purchases home.

, Bottled water - and other bottled drinks - are a major source of waste in many places. In some places bottled water is safer to drink than tap water, but if that's not the case in your area, consider using tap water instead. You can always filter the water if you don't like the way it tastes. This is more economical and much better for the environment.


If you really want to go the distance, you can nix other bottled and canned drinks, too. For example, instead of buying a case of ginger ale, why not make your own? Homemade lemonade and limeade are also great choices.
If you do choose to buy drinks by the bottle, choose large containers, rather than small ones. Get a 5 gallon (18.9 L) container of water with a dispenser instead of buying an 18-pack of small bottles.

, If you like using computers, there are very few reasons you still need to have a lot of paper waste in your house. Taking measures to reduce the amount of paper you buy, as well as the amount of paper that gets sent to you in the mail, can save you the headache of having to sort through piles of papers.


Go paperless when it comes to bills; choose to pay them online instead.
Consider reading your news online instead of having a newspaper delivered to your house.
Take measures to stop junk mail from overflowing your mailbox.

, Many of the containers used for cleaners and detergents aren't recyclable, so they end up going in the garbage. If you have the time and inclination, making your own formulas and storing them in glass containers will end up saving tons of money and significantly reduce your garbage output. You'll also end up creating a chemical-free environment for your family. Here are a few great recipes to try:


Make your own laundry detergent
Make your own glass cleaner
Make your own bathroom cleaner
Make your own kitchen cleaner
Make your own hand soap

Make your own shampoo and conditioner


, If you have old clothing, electronics, or other items you don't want but are still in decent shape, donate them instead of throwing them out in the trash. Better they end up in a classroom or someone's closet than the landfill.


Old clothes and fabric scraps can be donated to a fabric recycling facility.
Schools often accept donations of old computers and other electronics.
Contact a local homeless shelter, thrift store, or donation center to see about donating furniture, electronics, cars, and any other items you're finished using.

, Durable containers can be reused a number of times before they need to go out with the garbage or recycling. Bottles, boxes and bags can all serve a second purpose if you know how to use them.


Use paper bags to hold recyclables, if you don't have a bin. You can also use them to fashion book protectors - a flashback to grade school days.
Reuse paper by printing on both sides, or letting your children draw on the back of used paper.
Use food-grade glass containers (that didn't previously contain anything toxic) to store dry goods and leftovers.
Plastic containers are fine to use for storage, but be careful about reusing them too many times to store food. Plastic, even if it's food-grade plastic, can eventually break down and start leaching chemicals into the food.

, In some places you need to sort plastic, glass, and paper recyclables and and turn them in separately, while other cities allow you to place all recyclables in the same bin and be done with it. Some cities provide recycling pickup, while other places have a recycling center where you can drop everything off. Check your city's website and follow its policy regarding proper recycling.


In general, the following household waste can be recycled:

Plastic containers numbered 1 - 7Paper products like computer paper, egg cartons, newspaper, and cardboard
Glass containers
Aluminum cans, aluminum foil



, There are some household items that just can't be recycled or reused. These items have to be thrown out with the trash or disposed of at a hazardous waste facility. Try to reduce your consumption of the following items, and when you do use them, dispose of them according to your city's laws:


Batteries
Paint
TVs, computers, and other electronics
Light bulbs

, Food scraps and yard cuttings don't need to be thrown out. Instead, you can compost them and turn them into rich, nutritious soil that can be used to nourish your garden - or donated to someone else who will be able to use it for theirs. There are many ways to compost; some compost mixtures allow for items like meat and dairy to be included, while others are strictly for fruit and vegetable scraps. To start a basic compost pile, save these items:



Green items, which break down quickly, like raw vegetable peelings, coffee grounds, tea bags, grass cuttings, leaves

Brown items, which break down slowly, like sticks and branches, paper, cardboard, eggshells, sawdust

, Select an area in a sunny or partially shaded spot in your yard for your compost site. Ideally, you'll compost directly over dirt or grass, but if you don't have a large yard area, you can compost on a concrete patio. Here are a few different ways you can structure your compost site:


Make a compost pile. This is the simplest way to compost. All you have to do is make a pile in your yard. It should be located well away from your house, since composting sometimes attracts mice and insects.

Make a compost box. You can construct a box made to the exact dimensions that suit your needs using old pallets.
Buy a compost bin. They're available at most home and garden stores, and come in a variety of different shapes and sizes.

, Making a cold heap requires less effort, but it takes longer for the compost to be ready. Making a hot heap requires a little work, but you'll have compost in as little as 6 - 8 weeks. Here's the difference:


To make a cool compost heap, fill your bin with a few inches of both green and brown materials. Keep piling more in whenever you need to get rid of food scraps or toilet paper rolls. When the bin is full, leave it to compost. It may take up to a year to full compost, but you can use the compost forming at the bottom of the bin as needed.
To make a hot compost heap, mix your green and brown materials well, and fill your bin all the way up (or heap up a big pile). It will warm up and get hot to the touch; when this happens, stir it up, and it will cool. When it heats up again a few days or weeks later, stir it up again. Keep doing this until it stops heating up after you stir, then let it rest to finish composting.

, If it seems to be rotting too fast and turning slimy, add more brown items to slow it down. If it seems to be too dry to work its magic, add some water or more green items. Turn the pile periodically or when it smells like ammonia.The more effort you put into tending to your compost site, the faster you'll have usable compost.

, It can take a month or two to produce compost. You'll know your compost is ready when it turns a rich brown or black color and takes on an earthy smell. Your compost can be used to fertilize your vegetable or flower garden, or you can simply spread it around your yard to give your grass and other plants a nutrition boost.

Bear in mind the point of your yurt.,

Enjoy your time living in the yurt.",How to Live in a Yurt," There are many reasons why you might choose to live in a yurt, ranging from affordability to living a sustainable, nomadic lifestyle. What you will find in the literature is that many yurt-dwellers are not keen on the idea of ""permanency"" of a yurt, such as sinking in foundations and living in the same spot for many years. However, it is like most lifestyle choices in life, entirely up to you whether or not you're adding a yurt for permanent or nomadic reasons, or anything in between such as your annual summer retreat. Buy or build your yurt for your needs and reasons, and settle your own preferences for running the yurt sustainably, nomadically, permanently, etc. It is probably a good idea to read about yurt history and current yurt culture in western societies to get a feel for what's the current trend in yurt lifestyles, so that you can choose your own approach in an informed way.


Note that living in a yurt does not equate to ""roughing it"" unless that's a personal choice. You can be tech-connected, electricity using, and IKEA furniture filled in your yurt if that's your preference.;
, Are you going to build it from scratch or mail-order it? Look for patterns online to see if it's too hard for your skills or if you'll relish the challenge. Otherwise, look for yurts for sale - either brand new or used. Some companies in North America and Europe are renowned for making good quality, comfortable, and well proportioned yurts – do an online search.


Yurts tend to cost around US$2000 to $6000 to purchase in kit form, and take about two days to assemble., Obviously, put it somewhere legal, such as your own land. Squatting is not really an option for yurt living because shifting a lived-in yurt is a lot more effort than shifting a normal tent and camp set-up. In addition, by placing a yurt on land and deciding to live in it permanently, you may be changing the land-use or require planning permission, so check with your local municipality on the ins and outs of part-time or full-time yurt living.Other considerations when preparing your yurt include situating it where it won't be buffeted by wind, directly in the path-way of flash flooding, or situated at the end of a possible avalanche of snow during winter. Check out the lay of the land with care and assess all the potential hazards before siting your yurt.


Setting the yurt below the brow of a hill can protect it from winds.Take care of where water gathers on the land. If it's likely to run straight to your yurt space, it'll enter the yurt, making things messy.

, Dirt and grass are not ideal under your feet when it's your living quarters, so yurts tend to be built over or with decks, concrete surfaces, cinder block piers, or some other sort of structure that shifts you and your belongings away from the earth and up a bit. Decks bolted together and deck pads provide a suitable surface for placement of your yurt.The advantage of doing this is that you also gain a deck around the edges of the yurt where you can sit, barbecue, hang clothes, etc.


Find mats, rugs, and other suitable coverings for the floor to add to the warmth and comfort levels. Better still, put in a floating wooden floor or series of floor boards, with rugs over the top, to finish it off nicely.
Try to build a deck that is portable. That way, when you get the nomadic itch, the deck can also come with you., Before you add furniture, think about how to divide up the room. A round room can be difficult to furnish, especially when it's a single room that you're trying to turn into a little kitchen, bedroom, and living space. However, with the use of ""dividing"" furniture you can make distinct spaces within the round. For example, placement of a bookcase in the middle of the yurt can serve as an excellent divider between different areas and you can build out from it with other furniture items such as the bed, fridge, and desk.Add a table and chairs, bookshelf, comfortable reading chairs, desk and chair, and a heat apparatus, such as a pot-belly stove. If you don't want to add a real bed, use a camp stretcher bed or even a foldaway or inflatable bed usually used for guests.

, You'll need to eat, and even if much of your food is from the result of foraging, you'll need to cook. Find a suitable gas or wood fueled stove that can double up as a heating item in the yurt, such as a pot-bellied stove. Be sure to vent it outside through one wall of the yurt as it will create dangerous fumes within the yurt otherwise. You might need a professional to help you install this part of the yurt.


Find cast iron pans and a cast iron kettle for the stove top. Or, find other equally suitable cookware; look in thrift stores, camping or outdoor stores, or ask friends for items they no longer need.
For the sake of cooking and cleaning, be sure to have your yurt situated near a clean water supply or you risk lugging water all day. A small rainwater tank might be a good option, especially if you're nowhere near mains supply. Water can also be collected from the yurt's roof if you install an appropriate system for collection.If collecting wood for heat and cooking, be sure to do so sustainably, to minimize your impact on the local environment. Expect to get through about 3.5 cords of wood if living in your yurt through a Vermont-style snowy winter.
Having a propane barbecue as an additional source for cooking is a wise investment; it will cost around US$600 a year to run.You may find that a wood stove produces less condensation than a gas one., You will need a shower or bath area and a toilet; some people even plumb their yurts but for the most part, it's outdoor ablutions and cleaning. The toilet can be of a composting type and some yurt-dwellers compost human waste using the Humanure method. For a shower, this can be a simple contraption rigged up from a tree using a bucket or plastic bag, and using solar power to heat the water. You'll need to do some research into what's best for the property on which you're situated.


For winter bathing, you will need to work out alternative, tolerable options.
It's advisable to locate the toilet downwind from the yurt or some distance from it so that the odor and flies don't enter your yurt (although a well-maintained compost toilet should not have flies hanging around in any great number or an odor). On the other hand, you don't want it so far away that a trip in the rain to relieve yourself turns into a major expedition.
Bathe in a stream if it's warm enough during the warmer months.
It's also a good idea to have a general washing area for dirty gear and items.

, Electricity can be provided by the usual means by running a line from mains supply to your yurt (the least advisable given a yurt is about living sustainably), or by use of a generator. If you have solar or wind energy set up, this might also be able to supply you with electricity if you get some storage batteries (these should be sheltered somewhere nearby) and have the know-how to connect it.You'll need electricity for your fridge, lighting, and any other electrical items you're keeping in the yurt.


For lighting, find suitable gas, battery, or other fueled lamps that are safe to have inside tents. Have some candles for emergencies. LED lights are a very good investment.The dome at the center top of a yurt will allow plenty of light in during sunlight hours.Consider how you're going to wash clothes. Do you want a mini washer or will you trek into town to use the local laundromat? Do what works best for you; most items can be washed by hand until they're heavily soiled, so you could choose to do say, monthly very soiled washes in the laundromat and hand wash the rest of the time.

, Even in a yurt you should be able to surf online. There are a number of possible ways, including cable, satellite, rural broadband on an FM signal, or 3G Wi-Fi; select what works best for where you're located. Some people use the internet for downloading films too, so you can still keep up with your favorite latest movies!

, This can be a partial or even complete food supply for you and your other yurt residents and you might like to consider a few animals as well, for milk, eggs, and even meat.


Compost all your kitchen and food scraps and use the compost on your garden.

, Whether you're yurt-living for a season or a lifetime, you'll discover that you become one with nature in a yurt, as the weather impacts you more obviously, the wildlife lives around you undisturbed, and the necessity for being self-sufficient and resourceful bring home both how simple life can be, and how hard it can be sometimes too. You should discover the joy of living with less in your life but also finding you get a lot more out of everything you do have and everything that you notice. And while you may love the plot you've placed your yurt upon, some yurt-dwellers advise that it's important to try not to leave it there too long, because the original purpose of a yurt is to be a nomad, to move about and to discover new places. While that may not work for you, shifting could very well be the beginning of an amazing new adventure!


People living in yurts report a sense of coziness, safety, and homeliness from being in a yurt even though you can hear and feel the full brunt of nature outside. This is a big part of why people absolutely love yurt-living and it's not something you'll discover without trying it.

Find a suitable car.,
Before you start living in your car, use your permanent address to:


Rent a post office box or a Private Mailbox (PMB).,
Keep your personal identification, driver's license, car insurance current at all times.,
Buy a steering column lock and use it!,
Find a safe and inconspicuous place to park.,
Get earplugs.,
Find a place to shower.,
Be discreet.,
Get the things you'll need.,
Buy a combo backup battery/air compressor to jump start your car on your own.,
Find alternate ways of generating electricity.,
Have something portable to store your items.,
Keep dirty clothes separate in plastic bags so they do not smell up all your clothing.

,
Get a good quality flashlight.,
Evaluate your food options.,
Stay positive.",How to Live in Your Car," You can only live in your car successfully if your car works. If you have any lead time and see the writing on the wall ahead of time, get a van; ideally a windowless delivery van of some sort: you will have room under your platform bunk for storage, you can install a rooftop skylight/hatch for air, a rooftop rack for storage and even look out when the skylight is open. An anonymous looking white Chevy van, or Holden panel van in Australia makes concealment a lot easier. You're going to need a new or ""newish"" car or be a good mechanic to live in an older car. If you have an old car keep in mind that you're liable to break down at an inopportune moment if you don't stay on top of maintenance.;
, Although PMBs tend to be more expensive, you can receive packages at them and some services will let you use an address format which makes it appear to be an apartment; this can be useful when someone requires a physical address.
Sign up for a gym membership, or, if a gym is too expensive, a more affordable alternative is (depending on your location) to enroll at a local community college where you'll then be able to use their gym facilities. At some colleges, you don't even have to enroll. Just be discreet at a college where they leave the gym open and don't check for ID.
Renew any paperwork that will require an address to process soon.
Put valuables in a safe deposit box at a bank.


If you have friends or family who can't (or refuse to) help you with your living situation, or you refuse to ask them for help, think about at least asking them if you can use their address.

, Have it readily available for police inspection.

, Why so essential? Because if your vehicle gets stolen, your home is stolen, you may never see it again and then you really are in trouble! It's not just your property like it would be to someone with a home or an apartment - it's a matter of your survival. Buy one now! You can buy one for about $20., First, check to see if there are any organizations or businesses in your area (or a nearby area) that designates parking lots specifically for people in situations like yours; for example, Walmart allows people to camp overnight in their parking lots. It's not only legal, but the organization might screen the people who use the lot, or even designate a women-only lot.If there are no such lots available, and you live in an urban area, look for streets with no sidewalks, no overlooking windows, and adjacent to woods; the area should be sparse enough to avoid nosy onlookers but populated enough that the car does not stand out.Parking lots of big-box retailers (especially those that are open 24 hours and have restrooms, such as Walmart) are great to clean up in and have security, as long as you spend a couple of dollars there and don't park in one place too often. Parking lots however can be noisy, particularly in the morning as trucks arrive carrying food and goods. Church car parks are often quiet during weekdays. If you check around, you may find a church that is less used than others. This could be a good place to park, and you may be able to ask for assistance at the church. You might even attend the church to gain rapport, but wait a while before telling others about your situation, and tell only those who seem trustworthy and willing to help.Industrial estates and business parks are often noisy by day, but very quiet at night. Small ones close to residential areas are best. They have to be quiet at night. You may encounter security in some places like this, but if you are honest, saying you are just sleeping the night in your car, they usually won't bother you. Their main role is to protect the property.
University car parks. This is okay if you are a student, but not so good if you are not associated with the university. You may be required to get a parking permit.Camping grounds are another option, although they usually have time limits and some are almost as expensive as a hotel room. Some offer a shower for a nominal fee. National Forests have some free camping with a limit of 14 days.
Yacht harbors are notoriously 'free zones'—given the nature of fishermen and boats, so marinas offer a lot of services, like hot showers and transient vehicles. If the season is high, larger boats from out of state show up and stay for months along with their respective crews, all of whom are 'transients' providing excellent cover for you and your vehicle. They don't know or care, and if they find out they still don't care, being a 'little wild' themselves. Hang around on the weekend and meet someone who wants their boat washed and waxed—that'll do it, from there on in you'll have a gate/shower key and legitimacy.
If there's no restroom, having a creek nearby helps for rinsing purposes. Know how to safely defecate outdoors and make a poop tube. Five gallon bucket with a lid and lye for odour can also work.
A free hospital parking lot is another option. If approached by a guard, you can say that you're waiting to visit a sick relative.However, note that in Australia, due to past murders of nurses, you may attract police attention by parking in a hospital car park. You may be asked to move on by security.If you can establish rapport with the manager of a retail store or restaurant, they may not give you problems about staying overnight, especially if they see your presence as a form of overnight security.
Try a hotel parking lot. Hotels and motels along the interstate allow cars to park until 11:00 a.m. the next day (checkout time). As long as your seat reclines fully, no one will notice you. However, you'll need to keep moving on.
Once you find a spot, try to arrive late at night, and leave before 7am. This will draw as little attention as possible to yourself.

, Due to noise, you might find that you will need earplugs to sleep. Earplugs will block a lot of background noise to a level that is bearable. Earplugs are good for blocking out traffic, birds, animals, talking and background music. They will not block out very loud noise or close noise, such as some one tapping on your car.

, The most logical place would appear to be a gym. This will help you keep your sanity and give you a purpose to your morning. Don't settle for the first gym you find. If you look around, you may find nearly deserted gyms in which you can shower and fully clean yourself without embarrassment. Remember: the people who can least afford to sport the disheveled look of a homeless person are those who are homeless, so try not to look the part! Don't ""let yourself go"", as once descent starts, it is hard to pull out. Maintaining a well-kept appearance can only help you maintain a positive self-image during a time when it is being seriously challenged.


Gyms can be an expensive option. Many gyms range in cost from $35 a month to a more typical cost of $55 a week. This is pretty expensive just for a shower. Many councils, churches and support organisations have free showers. It can be a false economy to use a gym just for showers, particularly as there are many free ways to keep in shape without a gym.Try to remember the flip flops or water shoes as not to get a foot fungus and let the towel dry out in the car.
Community or Recreation centers that have gyms and showers are a cheaper option than the nationwide chains. Many Rec or Community centers yearly memberships cost about the same as the monthly memberships at a national gym. You may not be able to store your items as safely in these places though.
The next best choice is to check into an affordable caravan park one or two days a week. These usually range from about $18-$26 a night in Australia, possible more in the USA. You will have a spot to park your car, you can do laundry (usually an extra fee), fill up on water, have a shower and even pitch a tent if you have one. They usually have powered sites, so you can recharge your electrical devices or run a fan or heater.Another option, though possibly more expensive, is to book into a cheap motel or hostel once or twice a week and clean up thoroughly there (if you can afford it).

Swimming pools have showers, depending on whether they have private stalls or are set up gang style, they may provide a discreet place to shower.
Another option to consider- when you can't shower, use unscented baby wipes to clean up, or take a ""bum shower"" in a public restroom where you feel comfortable doing so. You also could learn local establishments that have single-person restrooms. Use them to washing you hair or face. Bring a towel to dry your head and the sink area, and be quick. Alternate between establishments.
At a truck stop, you can ask around for a shower coupon, if you feel safe allowing people to know that you're without a place to stay. Truck stops are good to sleep at too. Truck Stops can be noisy at night though, so ear plugs are recommended.Some toll roads, especially state turnpikes, have large rest areas with free showers for truckers. Since these are usually open 24 hours, these plazas are also good places to sleep.

Keep an eye out for community college athletic field houses—they don't always check IDs, and can be a good free shower option. Check their fee schedule—sometimes you can take a single class for a nominal price, thus becoming a legitimate member of the college community, with access to their gym, library, WiFi, employment office and other resources (in addition to learning something).

, Keeping your situation under wraps minimizes the embarrassment and helps avoid becoming a target for police officers and criminals alike.

Rotate among several parking locations to avoid getting noticed.
When you move around in the parked car, move slowly to avoid rocking the car.
When it's sunny in the daytime, use a sunshade for the windshield.
You may find that you need and want more privacy than windows offer. There are a few cheap ways to gain this privacy. Reflective window shades in your back and front window help. Similarly fold up shades on the side windows are good. You can also buy some cheap cloth and either stuff them in the windows, tape them in, or hold them in place by magnets.Black cloth is best for privacy and blocking out light.
If you can afford it, and local laws allow, and you don't mind driving with it, get your windows tinted as dark as legally possible. This along with the front sunshade and dark cloth or towels can provide a lot of privacy. If you hang a towel or cloth on a un-tinted window, it screams homeless person. You hang the same on a tinted window it'll be impossible to see inside and won't draw attention.
Keep the windows cracked open while you sleep, not wide enough for someone to reach in, but enough to allow fresh air and reduce condensation on the windows.

, The basic essentials for living in a car are a blanket, a pillow, and a mattress or some other padding. Due to the angles involved in the seating setup, you may develop dull back pain from the cramped quarters. Should this happen, be sure to have pain medication on hand. Once you have your sleeping gear, you'll want a blanket to place over the back seat, and draped over the two front seats. This will block light and people's views.


A cheap cooler will help make life easier. The main thing the cooler needs is to be waterproof. Cold food will cause condensation, while ice will melt. You don't want that water inside of your car. A cooler will help keep your perishable food cool. It will work most efficiently when full, so add bottles of cold water to it as you take out food. If you choose to buy an electric cooler, it will need good ventilation to work. For this reason, it will not work well in your car's boot. It is best placed within the car when running. Make sure it is only running when the engine runs, or use a low voltage cut out device, as explained below. Make sure the cooling vent grille is not touching anything as it exhausts waste heat and may set some things on fire.
One essential item, if you can afford it is a Porta-Potty, a chemical toilet. These devices can really make living in a car bearable. They can be purchased for under $100 new these days. If you can't afford a Porta-Potty or don't have room for one, you can pee into wide necked bottles like Gatorade bottles, or make an improvised bucket style toilet., Have a spare tire and at least one can of tire sealant. Be sure the sealant is of the type that can be removed.

, A cigarette lighter converter is one option. These are useful for powering low consuming devices (100 watts), but if you plan on using your vehicle for cooking, then you'll need to draw power more directly from your battery or you'll blow the fuse. Running electric cooking appliances from your car though is fairly impractical without an expensive dual battery and inverter system. There are small 12 volt water heaters and skillets, but these generally are not very efficient. You will also need a much more expensive inverter if you plan to run things that use mains voltage. You may need to idle the vehicle while drawing this power if you don't have a dual battery system, however even then, car alternators are not designed for such use and may not be able to produce the current you need.


A good buy for any car dweller is a low voltage cut out device.This device protects your car's battery by cutting off the electricity once the battery reaches a voltage where it can still start the car, but can't really run plug in devices much more. These usually retail for about $25-$40. They are a very good investment for a car dweller, as continual flattening of your battery will damage it, resulting in a costly replacement, and inconvenience of not being able to start the car.
An alternative to electric cooking devices is to use gas for cooking, but do not use this inside the vehicle for safety reasons. There are many dangers associated with cooking inside your car: unstable surfaces, fire hazards, burns from hot metal or spilled liquids, carbon monoxide build up, smells. Cooking is for outside of the car. If you live in a van with a stable set up for cooking, then cooking inside is okay, provided there is ventilation.

, Get bags you can fill with your soaps, clothes, cell phone, etc. Keeping things in order will save you a lot of hassle. A vehicle may seem like a small space, but losing things can be extremely easy. Also, keeping things neat inside the car will draw less attention from people passing by who happen to look in the windows. Hiding your bedding might be a good idea (consider the trunk). If there is not room in the car for a weeks worth of clothes and supplies, try to leave them at a friends for safekeeping and then you can have a reason to come over, and they may give you a shower and a place to hang out. When you do your laundry, be sure to get them bone dry, as you do not want damp clothes to mildew or smell bad in the car. When you're not in the car, leave windows cracked and dryer sheets scattered about to keep the interior smelling decent. Wash your sheets once a month, or else you risk smelling like a homeless person, which will blow your cover and get you treated like a homeless person.

,, A 3 or 4 battery Maglite flashlight serves two purposes: lighting and security. It is large enough to act as a metal baton to defend yourself, should the need arise.

, Peanut butter, tuna and crackers are great staples. Have a box for food so it does not get smashed. Gallons of water are a necessity for a lot of things. The amount of food you can keep at any one time will be limited by the lack of refrigeration. Fast food is expensive when you're living off it. With old fashioned (large flake) rolled oats, powdered milk, bottled water, plastic cups, and chocolate protein powder, you can ensure that you always have a nutritious snack to fall back on., Keep reminding yourself that the situation is only temporary. Spend each day hitting the pavement and looking for jobs. Use the local library and bookstore not only to search for jobs, but also to become more knowledgeable in ways that will help you get through this and find a job. Search the Internet for free community voicemail services, and/or get a prepaid cell phone so employers can call you. To build your funds, consider food stamps, food banks and soup kitchens. Most importantly, talk to people like social workers and religious organization workers who will sympathize and understand, and try to help.

Be fussy.,
Buy organic and hemp.,
Buy vintage.,
Recycle.,
Tweak it.,
Look after it.,
Buy Fair Trade.",How to Green Your Clothing," Some would call this being discerning. Buy something only if you absolutely love it. In this way, you cut down on spontaneous shopping and shopping for the sake of it. Finally, ask yourself whether or not you really need to buy the garment that you’ve randomly plucked off the rack on your way to the food section? Are you buying because you can, or because you really need another t-shirt?


Plan to keep your clothing for a while, and wear what you have. Buying less guarantees you use fewer resources.;
, Cotton, despite the years of marketing as a clean and natural fabric, uses no less than a third of a pound of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the production of one t-shirt. Organic cotton and other fashion alternatives are now available. Try the local variety stores first. Read the labels. Organic clothing can range from is 5% organic to 100%. Look for local designers and look for hemp, organic cotton and other eco-choices.

, The new term for used clothing is pretty trendy right now, particularly in places like the UK, Australia, US etc. where charity shops are a wonderful source of cheap, recycled clothing. Whilst such stores are not big in some countries, there is the odd charity shop worth a visit. Alternatively, get together with a group of friends and each bring 5 garments for a big ""swap"" session. And look for consignment stores too. These often have great designer bargains that let clothes have a new lease of life for a fraction of the original cost.

, Instead of throwing away, recycle your old clothes. Some recycling organizations have a section for old clothes, and if they don’t, then get your clothes back into circulation by donating them to a community, or resell them from your garage, sell them on the community exchange system or freecycle them. Or completely remodel them into the latest fashion look! (See How to Make a Whole New Wardrobe by Recycling Your Clothes)

, Is there anything in your wardrobe worth salvaging? Get creative, transform old clothes and find new life for them. Now called ""a re-purposed garment"" the trend to convert old clothing into new is fast replacing the need to buy new every season. Here are some ideas:How to Turn an Oversized T Shirt Into a Hot Mini DressHow to Make a Baby Romper from a T ShirtHow to Make a Denim Skirt From Recycled Jeans

, Once you’ve bought a quality organic item, look after it. Wash it carefully—turn it inside out when it’s drying in the hot sun, use the lowest temperature when washing, and use biodegradable detergents. Sun-dry your garments and try not to dry-clean. If you do have things to dry clean, look around for a dry cleaner in your area who uses newer, green methods. If you’re really concerned about going green and want to go the extra mile, wash your clothes in a pedal-powered washing spin dryer machine!

, Any clothing that bears the label ""Fair Trade"" is produced ethically, using ecologically sound and sustainable practices. And everyone involved gets a fair wage. Fair Trade doesn’t just apply to bananas and coffee; it plays a very important part in the clothing and textile industry. Although there isn’t a lot of fair trade clothing available yet in some countries, there is often jewelry and locally produced accessories made by local communities that is worth the investment, so look out for these. In the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, more and more ethically produced clothing is now available. For those living in countries with Fair Trade labelling in operation, prefer this type of clothing where you can.

Determine the area of your sector.,
Get the area of the triangle.,
Subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the sector.,
Multiply the area of your segment by the height of your cylinder.,
Determine the fill height.",How to Work Out Water Tank Capacity1," The region enclosed by the circle at the bottom of the cylinder is your bottom base surface (B). A radius is any line segment that runs from a circle’s center to its perimeter. To find the radius, simply measure from the mid-point of the cylinder’s bottom to the outside of the circle.


A diameter is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and has endpoints on the circle’s perimeter. For any circle, the diameter will be twice the radius. Therefore, you can also find the radius of the circle at the bottom of the cylinder by measuring the complete radius and dividing that number in half.;
, Once you know the radius of your bottom base surface (B), you can calculate the area. To do so, use the formula B = πr2, using your radius as r and 3.14159 for π, which is a mathematical constant.

, You can now determine the total volume of the tank by multiplying the area by the length of the tank. The full formula for total volume of the tank is Vtank = πr2h.

, If you imagine a circle cut into slices, like a pizza, each slice is a sector. If a chord (a line segment that joins two points on a curve) cuts through that sector, it divides the sector into two parts: a triangle and a segment. This segment is important because to calculate the filled volume of your cylinder, you’ll have to find the area of a segment (by finding the area of the whole sector and subtracting the area of the triangle) and multiply it by the length of the cylinder.

, The sector is a fractional portion of the area of the whole circle. To find its area, use the formula shown above.

, Find the area of the triangle that was formed by the chord that cut through the sector. Use the formula shown above.

, Now that you have both the area of your sector and the area of your triangle, a subtraction will yield the area of your segment, D.

, When you multiply the area of your segment by the height, the product is the filled volume of your tank. The relevant formulas are shown above.

, Your final step depends on if the height, d, is greater than or less than the radius, r.


If the height is less than the radius, use the volume created from the filled height Vfill. So,
If the height is greater than the radius, use the volume created by the empty portion, minus the total volume of the tank. This will give you the filled volume:

Purchase a waterless car cleaner.,
Dampen a microfiber towel with a waterless car cleaning solution.,
Spray your car with the same cleaning solution.,
Wipe your car in a circular motion with your cloth.,
Rinse off the cleaning solution with a damp microfiber cloth.,
Dry the area with a dry microfiber cloth.,
Repeat until your car is completely clean.",How to Wash Your Car Using Less Water1," There are various waterless car cleaners on the market. Take a look at critical and user reviews for different brands. Relate customer experiences and choose the brand that you trust the most. Waterless car cleaners can be purchased at some department stores, most major automotive retailers, and online.


Some popular brands of waterless car wash include, Meguiar’s Wash & Wax Anywhere, WOW Classic & Sports Box Kit, and Eco Touch Waterless Car Wash.Some car washes like Eco Touch Waterless Car Wash use eco-friendly or biodegradable ingredients that aren't harmful to the environment.;
, Soak a microfiber tower with a cleaning solution produced specifically to clean cars. Waterless cleaning solutions allow you to wash your car with minimal or no water. Make sure that cloth is completely saturated before beginning to clean your car.


Microfiber cloth is non-abrasive and works better than regular rags at cleaning your car and preserving its paint.Do not use a household soap or dish detergent because it could strip the protective wax from your car., Fill a spray bottle or use one that comes with your product to moisten a small section of the car that you want to clean. You should only need three to four sprays for this. Do not spray over the entirety of the car because the solution could dry before you get to wipe it. Work in small concentrated sections of the car before moving onto another section.


Get a car cleaning solution that helps break down dirt rather than moving it., Take the cloth saturated with your cleaning solution and work it into the surface of the car.You should start to see the solution start to sud or streak across where you are wiping. Go over each area for around 10-30 seconds.


Start in small areas and move around the car. For example, you can start on the hood of the car then move your way to the passenger side door.

, Place your microfiber cloth in a bucket filled with a cup of water, or run it under your sink for five seconds. Once it's saturated, go over the areas that you scrubbed with your cleaning solution. Continue to do this until the remainder of the solution is off your car, and there is no leftover residue or fogginess., Once the area is rinsed, work the area in a circular motion with a dry microfiber cloth. Once you're done drying it, the area that you've cleaned should look shiny and reflective. Make sure that you dry each section thoroughly so that you aren't leaving any chemicals behind on your paint.


As an alternative, you can also use a squeegee to help dry areas of your car., Repeat the process and move to different portions of your car until the entirety of the car is clean. During this process, you may have to use a lot of microfiber cloth, so make sure to be as conservative as possible and reuse them when you can.

Look for the valve closest to the fixture.,
Turn the valve clockwise.,
Make any necessary repairs.",How to Turn off Your Water Supply Quick and Easy1," Most fixtures will have an individual shut off located beneath the fixture.It will likely be a chrome valve. Sinks and showers may have two valves, one for hot and one for cold. Turn each of the valves off to shut off all the water.


Some appliances such as washing machines, dish washers or refrigerators may have a water shut off switch on the body of the appliance or on the hose that connects to wall.
To shut off water to a water heater, look for a cold water valve directly above the water heater on a connected pipe.;
, This will cut off the water to the fixture. You will still be able to use running water in other fixtures or appliances throughout the rest of the home.


Tip: If the valve seems difficult to turn you may want to wear a work glove to protect your hand. You can also use a wrench if necessary.

, The water will no longer run to the specific appliance. You may need to drain a little bit of water that is remaining in the pipes of the fixture, so it is a good idea to keep a bucket handy. When you are finished, turn the valve counter-clockwise to turn the water supply back on.

Boil your water.,
Buy a small ion exchange filter.,
Add non-precipitating water conditioner to your laundry.,
Treat hard water spots with vinegar.,
Measure your water hardness.,
Find the right size softener.,
Choose a type of softener.,
Find out how to maintain the softener.,
Check the leasing plan.,
Install the softener.",How to Soften Hard Water," Boiling water only removes some types of hardness (""temporary hardness""), so it will not work for all homes. Try this once to see if it works for you:Bring the water to a boil for a few minutes.
Let it cool for a couple hours. White minerals should settle to the bottom of the pot.
Siphon or scoop up the top of the water, leaving the minerals behind.
Optional: before drinking, remove ""flat"" flavor by pouring back and forth between two containers. This restores air lost to boiling.;
, Some models attach to a kitchen faucet, while others come in pitchers for you to store drinking water. The softened water often has a better taste, but the effect depends on the exact minerals in your water.


This ""filter"" does not actually remove most contaminants, unless the device has a secondary filter (such as carbon filter or reverse osmosis).Most coffee fanatics dislike the taste of soft water coffee.Look for a faucet model with a switch-off valve, so you can keep your hard water brew.

, These products trap some of the minerals in your water during the wash. Make sure the product is ""non-precipitating"" — you may need to search online to find out. Avoid ""precipitating"" conditioner, which leaves scale on fabric and washing machines. Once you've picked a product, add it to laundry as follows:Add it the wash cycle according to label instructions. If you don't know your area's exact water hardness, add conditioner until the water feels slippery and suds appear during the wash.
Add a second batch of conditioner during the rinse cycle. Without this, all the minerals will just latch back onto your clothes.

, Distilled white vinegar can remove white spots on fabric, drains, or porcelain from mineral buildup. Apply plain or dilute with an equal amount of water, scrub away the problem, then rinse. This temporary solution can get tedious if scale builds up quickly. If your water is only slightly hard it might be a cost-effective approach.


Towels can also become stiff due to hard water. Treat them the same way.
Vinegar can bleach some types of fabric and damage stoneware.
Some people add ½ cup (120mL) vinegar to the rinse cycle in their water, while others claim this can damage the rubber seals on your machine. Consider checking with your machine manufacturer.

, Look online for cheap test strips, or a more accurate water hardness test kit.

, Most test kits in the United States measure the hardness in ""grains per gallon."" Multiply this result by the gallons of water your household uses each day, on average (according to your water bill). This is the number of ""grains"" of hardness the device would soften each day. Choose a softener labeled for about 10 times this number of grains. This means the softener will work for about ten days before it needs some downtime.The average US resident uses 100 gallons of water a day (or 70 gallons if you're only softening indoor water use).For example, your household water hardness has 9 grains per gallon. You use 300 gallons per day, so 9 x 300 = 2,700 grains per day. A softener in the 27,000 grain range (2,700 x 10) is about the right size.

, Ion exchange softeners are by far the most effective home softener. Most other devices are much less effective, or even just scams. Ion exchange softeners come in two types:


Sodium chloride: the most common and most effective type. This adds a tiny amount of salt (sodium) to your water.
Potassium chloride: less effective, but useful if you can't have sodium. The potassium can harm people with damaged kidneys or on certain medications that prevent potassium absorption.If you don't want sodium or potassium, pick either type and install a reverse osmosis (RO) filter as well to remove them after softening.

, Once you've narrowed down the choice to some good models, look at the details. Many softeners refill themselves automatically, going offline for a while during this time. Some do this whenever the softening resin drops too low. Others can be set for a specific time once a week, so you're never caught with hard water unexpectedly., You can buy the softener in one go or lease it for a monthly payment. Besides reducing the upfront cost, leasing it usually comes with a professional installation, so you don't have to do it yourself. Try to get at least two quotes on the installation and lease.When comparing prices, check for a certification seal as well, such as the NSF or WQA marks of approval. This doesn't guarantee top quality, but it separates the proven machines from the scams.

, If you decide to install the softener yourself, follow the instructions in the linked article. Most softeners also come with detailed installation instructions, although basic plumbing experience will help.

Purchase a nozzle for your hose.,
Research eco-friendly car washes in your area.,
Use a bucket of water instead of an open hose.,
Wash your car less.,
Wash your car in a shaded area.",How to Wash Your Car Using Less Water2," If you don't have a bucket and must use a hose, make sure that you buy a nozzle that will allow you to regulate water flow. The average hose will waste 10 gallons of water per minute, meaning that for a 10-minute wash, you'll have used 100 gallons of water. A turnoff nozzle will allow you to rinse your car quickly and turn off your hose while you scrub again.You can purchase a nozzle for your hose at most home and gardening and department stores.
The cost of hose nozzles range from $14 to $20., The average car wash uses less water on average than doing it yourself. Search for eco-friendly car wash businesses that actively try to reduce their water usage. There are also other car washes that recycle harmful chemicals like dust, sediment, and detergents and prevent them from entering the stormwater system.


Some cities that experience regular droughts have banned residential car washing.On average, professional car washes will only use 14-18 gallons of water to wash your car.

, Using a bucket and a wet sponge or rag to rinse your vehicle will help you save water.Fill your buckets with three gallons or less of water. Instead of washing your car down with a garden hose, rinse your car by using a wet rag or sponge dipped in clean water. When your water gets dirty, empty it out and get a fresh bucket.


Separating your buckets of water by soapy and clear water will prevent you from having to replace it continually.

, An easy way to reduce the amount of water you're using to wash your car is simply to lessen the frequency in which you are washing it. Determine how much time elapses between washings and adjust it to a longer span of time.


For instance, if you wash your car every two weeks, consider trying to go without a car wash for two months.
Citizens in Los Angeles, California took a pledge not to wash their cars for 60 days as a response to an ongoing drought., Sunlight can cause water to evaporate quicker, which could increase the amount of water you need to use to rinse off your car.Find some shade, such as under foliage or an outdoor roof.

Identify the main shut off valve.,
Turn the valve clockwise.,
Turn on all of the faucets to empty the existing water in the system.",How to Turn off Your Water Supply Quick and Easy2," This is usually a brass valve which has a round handle. In the majority of homes is located near to the point where the water pipe makes its way into the property - often in the kitchen, downstairs WC or even utility room. In warmer areas this valve may be found outside, in colder climates it will be inside the home., This will cut off the stream of cold water into the home. All appliances that use water will no longer work until the water is turned back on.

, Run your sinks and showers until the water stops flowing. Turn off the faucets. Now you can begin your plumbing repairs safely. When you are finished turn the valve counterclockwise to restore water.

Look for a valve or small handle.,
Turn a gate valve handle clockwise as far as possible.,
Turn the ball valve off by spinning it a quarter of a turn.,
The water supply should now be cut off.",How to Turn off Your Water Supply Quick and Easy3," Most companies will allow you to access the shutoff valve. There are only three main reasonsto shut off the street water cutoff:


Your inside water shutoff fails and you have an emergency, such as a burst pipe.
There is a leak in the pipe between the street shutoff and the house shutoff valve.
You are replacing the main shutoff valve inside your home.

, Many houses have a water meter and shut off valve located together, generally in a box with an access cover between the street and the home.

, These covers can be quite heavy and difficult to open by design. You may need a wrench with a long extension to access valves that are deeper. This is common practice in the north where the weather is colder.

, These are the two possible types of shutoffs that you may encounter. The type of valve with a handle is called a ball valve. The kind with a more circular handle is called a gate valve.

, Make sure the valve is all the way closed so there is no more water flowing to house. These valves can lock up if they have not been used recently.


If a valve will not turn with a reasonable amount of pressure, do not force the valve. Call a licensed plumber or public works to assist you.

, If you see a valve with metal flange, you may have to make use of a pipe wrench to turn it. When the valve is on, the handle will be aligned with the pipe. When the handle is at a right angle to the pipe the water is off., However, keep in mind that there will still be water inside the house. You will need to drain simply by turning on every one of the faucets. This procedure should include shower or bath fixtures as well.

Find the volume of your tank.,
Calculate the filled volume.",How to Work Out Water Tank Capacity3," To determine the volume of a rectangular tank, multiply the length (l) times the width (w) times the height (h). The width is the horizontal distance from side to side. The length is the longest dimension, and the height is the vertical length from top to bottom.

, For rectangular tanks, the filled volume is simply the same length and width with a shorter height. The new height is the fill height, d. Therefore, filled volume is equal to the length times the width times the fill height.

Upgrade your washing machine.,
Prioritize front-load models when buying a washing machine.,
Pre-treat difficult stains before washing them.,

Skip additional rinse cycles.",How to Save Water in the Laundry Room1," Newer models of washing machine are generally designed to be more efficient when it comes to energy and water consumption. For this reason, buying a newer model alone can significantly cut your household's water usage.


Newer models of washing machine also have special water saving modes that you can utilize to conserve water even more.;
, Top-load models of washing machine generally use 2/3's more water than front-load models. Due to improved design, front-load washing machines can save you a considerable amount of water in the laundry room with every load., Some stains may require special pre-treating techniques, but you can pre-treat most stains by saturating the stain with a stain remover. After that, rub the stain remover into the stain with your finger.


For especially bad stains, you might need to rub the stain remover gently with a toothbrush. Brushing too hard could cause the color in the fabric to lift.Stain remover can be found in the laundry section of most grocery stores, general retailers, and drug stores.
Pre-treating will ensure your stains come out in the first wash cycle, which will save you from wasting water re-washing clothes., Full loads of laundry maximize the water used in the washing process. By faithfully washing full loads of laundry, you could end up saving as much as 10,534 gallons of water per year.Newer models of washing machine may have special settings that allow the amount of water used to be adjusted, allowing you to save water by matching load size with water amount.

, Your washer may have the option for a secondary and unnecessary rinse cycle. In many cases, this is signified by the words ""Extra Rinse.""Turn off this feature to save your household a load of water with each complete wash cycle.


The ""Extra Rinse"" cycle helps to remove detergent more thoroughly from your clothing. However, people with sensitive skin can suffer skin irritation if the Extra Rinse is skipped.
If you have sensitive skin but still want to save water, consider using gentle, all-natural, chemical free detergents. These are gentler on the skin, and might not cause irritation when skipping the Extra Rinse cycle."

, Is it clear or cloudy? Can you see particles floating in the water or settling to the bottom of the glass? Anything other than clear liquid could be a sign of bacterial or particulate contamination.

, Does it smell like rotten eggs, a swimming pool, nail polish remover, or anything else unpleasant? These odors could indicate the presence of high chlorine content, organic solvents, or naturally-occurring sulfur.

, The tests typically measure chlorine, nitrates and nitrites, minerals such as iron, copper, and lead, and the hardness of your water. The results will be more accurate than you can get by simply looking at your water.


Water purity test kits typically cost less than $40.
Test kits are not difficult to read. For the test itself, you'll dip test strips into your water. Your kit will come with a chart that will help you read the test strips and determine what is in your water. Not only will you be able to see what kinds of contaminates may be in your water, you will also be able to see if they are present in safe or dangerous levels. Based on the results of your test kit, you may want to purchase a water filtering system for your home or call your water utility for other options on purifying your water.

Call a boiler repair or maintenance professional if problems persist.",How to Start a Boiler," Depending on the make and model of your boiler, its startup procedure may vary. Many boilers list general startup instructions on a label attached to the front jacket panel. Always follow boiler directions for safe startup and usage.Improper boiler startup or operation could result in damage to the boiler, exposure to hazardous materials, fires, or an explosion. If your boiler does not have startup instructions attached, check its user manual or look up a digital manual online with a keyword search for the boiler’s make and model.
Because there are many different boiler designs, a manual diagram of your boiler will make locating parts on it easier.;
, Smell the area around the boiler for gas. Some gas may be heavier than air, so check close to the floor for the smell of gas as well. There should be no water leaks or standing water around the boiler. Water can cause the electrical components of your boiler to malfunction dangerously.

If you smell gas, do not turn on any appliances, light switches, or phones. All people in the building should exit it. Call your gas supplier from outside or a neighbor’s phone to receive further instructions.
If any part of the boiler has been submerged in water, do not activate it. In this situation, call a boiler specialist to inspect it and replace ruined parts.
If there's a water leak, turn off power to the boiler and repair the leak immediately. Dry the area, then return power to the boiler., The relief valve is generally found coming off the top side of the boiler cylinder. While the boiler is off and cold, open the valve to release air in the top of the tank. Fill the tank with soft water to the indicated level. Close the relief valve.

Some boilers may require the addition of certain chemicals, like ones that prevent rust, to the water. These and their use should be listed on the label attached to the boiler or in the user manual., Turn the control switch on the boiler to the “On” position. This will activate the control valves for the steam or boiler water and the thermostat(s). Verify that these are working properly. Set the thermostat(s) to the lowest temperature possible.Some boilers may have more than one thermostat, like those that have both an operating thermostat and an upper operating thermostat.
Boilers with multiple thermostats may have specific startup settings for each one. Check the instructions attached to the boiler or its user manual to verify the startup settings., Shut off the boiler’s power. Use a screwdriver to remove the front jacket panel. Set the panel aside and store the screws somewhere they won’t be lost, like in a plastic baggie., Behind the jacket panel you should find a gas control knob or switch. Turn knobs clockwise or flick switches to the “Off” position to turn off the gas. Wait at least five minutes, then smell the area for gas.

Should you smell gas, don’t turn on anything (including phones or light switches), evacuate the building, and call the gas company for instructions.Some boilers may require the manual main steam or boiler water supply valve to be opened while switched off and cold. Generally, heat supply should be introduced gradually. Open valves slowly., Turn gas knobs counterclockwise or flip switches to the “On” position. Return power to the boiler. Note the current temperature of your thermostat(s). Generally, boilers shouldn’t be heated more than 100°F (37.8°C) per hour.Many in-home boilers have auto igniters and should not be lit by hand. If your boiler doesn’t have this feature, follow the lighting instructions in your boiler’s user manual.Unless your boiler has a clearly indicated manual lighting procedure, you should not attempt to manually light your boiler.
Even with an auto igniter, you'll still need to remove the front jacket panel to control the gas supply and adjust certain settings.

, If your target temperature is less than 100°F (37.8°C), set your thermostat(s) to that temperature. If not, increase your boiler temperature by increments less than 100°F every hour until you reach your target temperature.

Boilers with multiple thermostats may have ideal ranges for each thermostat. This information should be indicated on the attached label directions or in the user manual.
Boilers should not pulse or make a hammering noise. These can cause damaging strain and vibrations in the boiler. In these instances, turn off power to the boiler, shut off its gas, and consult a professional., Fit the jacket panel back into place on the boiler. Replace the screws with your screwdriver.Check the gauge readings against the specifications listed on the nameplate of the boiler. Gauges should never exceed nameplate ranges.If your boiler fails to start, reset the thermostat to the lowest temperature, turn off power to the boiler, and turn off the gas. At this point, you’ll need to troubleshoot or call a professional., The electrical components of boilers can be fragile. You may have jostled a connection. Make sure all connections are well fastened. Starting your boiler can also blow fuses, so check these as well., Some boilers may have an adjustable limit for temperature or pressure. These limits are sometimes set lower than the boilers ideal operating temperatures. Check limit settings on the boiler control box or behind the jacket panel., If neither connections, fuses, nor limits are stopping your boiler for starting, you may have problem with your gas supply. Check that the gas is turned on at your meter. Verify with your gas company that you have service. Once gas is restored, prep your boiler for startup., If after troubleshooting your boiler still will not start, call a boiler professional. You should also seek a professional’s opinion if you notice irregularities with your boiler. The consequences of a malfunctioning boiler can be severe."

Decide how much water to store.,
Consider bottled water.,
Select food grade containers.,
Clean the containers thoroughly.,
Disinfect water from unsafe sources.,
Filter out contaminants.",How to Store Water Long Term1," The average person needs 1 gallon (4 liters) of water each day, half for drinking and half for food preparation and hygiene. Increase this number to 1.5 gallons (5.5 L) per person or more for children, nursing mothers, and sick people, and for anyone in a hot or high-altitude climate. Based on these numbers, try to store a two week supply for your household.In case of an emergency evacuation, store a three day supply in easily transportable containers.For example, two healthy adults and one child need (1 gallon / adult) x (2 adults) + (1.5 gal / child) x (1 child) = 3.5 gallons (13 L) per day.
A two week supply of water for this household is (3.5 gallons / day) x (14 days) = 49 gallons (185 L).
A three day supply would be (3.5 gal/day) x (3 days) = 10.5 gallons (40 L).;
, In areas that regulate bottled water, including the U.S. and E.U., sealed bottles of water are already sanitary and will stay good indefinitely. If you go this route, you can skip straight to storage.Check the label for certification by the IBWA (International Bottled Water Association), NSF (National Sanitation Foundation), or UL (Underwriters Laboratories). These demonstrate the product has met safety and quality standards.This is more important in countries that do not regulate bottled water.

, Plastic food or beverage containers marked ""HDPE"" or with a #2 recycling symbol are excellent options.Plastics #4 (LDPE) and #5 (PP) are also safe, as is stainless steel.Never reuse a container that held anything besides food and drink, and only use brand-new empty containers if they are marked ""food grade,"" ""food safe,"" or with a knife and fork symbol.


Milk and fruit juice leave residue that is difficult to remove and encourages bacterial growth. Do not reuse containers that held these drinks.Glass jars are a last resort, since they can easily break in a disaster.
Traditional unglazed pottery jars can help keep the water cool in warm climates. Use one with a narrow mouth, lid, and tap if possible to encourage sanitary handling., Wash them with soap and hot water, then rinse. If a container previously held food or drink, disinfect it with one of the following methods:


Fill with water and mix in 1 tsp (5 mL) liquid household bleach for every quart (liter) of water. Swish to touch all surfaces, then rinse well.For stainless steel or heat-safe glass, submerge in boiling water for 10 minutes, plus 1 minute for each 1,000 ft (300 m) of altitude above the first.This is the best method for steel, since chlorine bleach can corrode the metal., If your tap water is not safe to drink or if you get your water from a well, disinfect it right before storage. The best way to do this is to bring the water to a rolling boil for one minute, or three minutes at elevations above 5,000 ft (1,000 m).If you cannot boil the water, or do not want to lose water by boiling it, bleach is the next best option:Mix in ½ tsp (2.5 mL) of unscented, additive-free bleach for every 5 gallons (19 L) of water. Double the amount of bleach if the water is cloudy or discolored.
Let the water sit for half an hour.
If you cannot smell a faint chlorine scent, repeat treatment and let sit another 15 minutes.

, Boiling or chlorine will kill microorganisms, but they will not remove lead or heavy metals. If your water is contaminated by runoff from farms, mines, or factories, pour it through an activated carbon filter and a reverse osmosis (RO) filter.You can make your own filter out of common materials. While not as effective as a commercial filter, it will remove sediment and some toxins.

, Print the energy and water consumption chart and post it in a visible spot in your home. Chart the number of gallons of water used in the last 12 months (for comparison to each month this year).

, For example, buy water saving products where needed, such as a low-flush toilet and a water-saving showerhead.

, For example, place signs near water outlets reminding family members to reduce consumption (e.g., shorter showers, turning the faucet off when not needed, only watering outdoor plants in the morning or evening).

, Once a month, add the new usage information to the charts and make adjustments as needed to reach your goals.

, If you have children, increase their allowances by the amount saved to encourage them to get involved in finding new ways to conserve.

Check for and repair leaks regularly.,
Use basins and buckets when cleaning.,
Direct greywater drainage to plants and trees.",How to Save Water in the Laundry Room2," Over time, the fittings and connectors on your pipes can come loose. Loose plumbing may allow water to drip through, which over time can create quite a bit of waste. In many cases, tightening the connections with a wrench may solve your problem, though other leak fixing techniques may be required.


Leaky plumbing, beyond contributing to water waste, can also cause significant damage to the infrastructure of your home and to your possessions as well.
Hoses connected to your washing machine can be jostled loose sometimes, especially if you've cleaned recently. Check and re-fasten these on your washer., When cleaning fruit, food, around the home, cloth items, and so on, you may be tempted do so with a steady stream of water straight from the faucet. While this is often most convenient, it can result in unnecessary waste.


Add a conservative estimate of the water you need to a basin or bucket. Use this to clean, and, if necessary, add more water to the bucket little by little., The term ""greywater"" refers to the mostly reusable water that is the byproduct of washing in sinks, tubs, washing machines, and so on. This water should not have come into contact with feces.It can be a useful form of irrigation around your lawn, and can help you cut down on your sprinkler usage.You can hire a plumber to redirect your greywater drainage directly to your lawn or garden.

Call your water supplier to see if they perform regular tests on the water they supply to you.,
Obtain any results from the supplier and check it for problems with water quality.",How to Test Water Purity2,"


In the United States, the government mandates that water utilities regularly perform a series of tests on the water. The testing results are published in the Consumer Confidence Report, which you can get from your water utility.
Other locations and countries may have similar testing requirements. Contact your water supplier for more information.

,


To read your report, consult the guide that will come with it. Based on the results of this testing you can call the EPA hotline number you'll find in the report to inquire about measures being taken to ensure the quality of your water if the report reflects a dangerous level of contaminates.

Identify laboratories that can perform the tests you desire.,
Take one or more samples of your water for testing.,
Mail or take the sample(s) of your water to the laboratory for analysis.",How to Test Water Purity3," Check with your local health department for a list of qualified labs.

, Follow the directions from the laboratory on how to take the samples and prepare them for transportation to the laboratory. You do not want to provide contaminated or otherwise compromised water samples for testing.

, Light and heat can damage containers, especially plastic ones. Sunlight can also cause algae or mold to grow in clear containers, even sealed, store-bought bottles.Do not store plastic containers near chemical products, especially gasoline, kerosene, and pesticides. Vapors can pass through some plastic containers and contaminate the water.Store a three day supply in small containers near an exit, in case of an emergency evacuation.

, Unopened, store-bought bottled water should stay good indefinitely, even if the bottle has an expiration date.If you bottled the water yourself, replace it every six months.Replace plastic containers when the plastic becomes cloudy, discolored, scratched, or scuffed.You can drink or use the old supply of water before replacing it.

, If you need to use your emergency supply, store open water containers in a refrigerator or cold location. Use an open container within 3 to 5 days in the refrigerator, 1 to 2 days in a cold room, or a few hours in a warm room.After that, purify the remaining water again by boiling it or adding chlorine.


Drinking directly from the container or touching the rim with dirty hands increases the risk of contamination.

Finished.",How to Fix a Garden Hose," If it didn't squirt you in the face, you may have to go on a hole hunt. Does your hose leak at the faucet? Does it leak where you've joined two hoses? Does it leak at the point where you've attached a sprinkler head or spraying device? Or does it leak somewhere in the middle?






;
, Detach the hose from other hoses or devices, and thoroughly lube the threads of each with petroleum jelly.









Reattach and you will notice fewer leaks, or even none at all. Be careful trying to reattach the items as your hands will be slick.
Another option is to use a rubber washer. These are available at a hardware or garden supply store and can be slipped onto the ""female"" end of the hose. This should prevent leaking when it is joined to another hose or device.

,









Using a dry paper towel, dry off the section of hose where there is a hole or cut. If the hole is within a foot (30 cm) of the end of the hose, try using a piece of dowel with paper towel wrapped around it to clean the inside of the hose.
Apply some rubber cement to — and around — the hole. Fill in the hole, but not so much that it gets inside of the hose. This could result in clogging up the hose, and increasing the water's pressure, causing more leaks and an incentive for the hose to burst at that weak spot.

, These are most commonly sold at bicycle repair shops, body shops, car-part stores, etc.









Carefully read the directions of use, and apply the repair substance to the hole.
After drying, buy a small sheet of solid rubber from a craft store, hardware store or other supplier. You can also cut a small square out of an old rubber rain boot, bicycle tire, or any other rubber item you no longer use.
Glue it over the leak and let dry (use a glue able to keep the rubber attached strongly

, They are available at a hardware store. Repair couplings work by allowing you to cut out the leaky portion of hose and re-join it where you made the cuts.









Shutoff the water to the hose and cut out the bad portion.
Splice in the repair coupling. It will have detailed instructions on the label.

Choose a skid loader, either from a rental company or someone who will loan you one.,
Take time to look at the safety tips in the operator's manual.,
Find a location like a field, or even a large, empty parking lot to practice in.

,
Climb into the operator's seat, and take a look around.,
Look at the controls.,
There should be a seat belt and rollover bar, like the one on amusement part rides that pulls down from over your head to secure you in the seat.,
Locate the starter controls.,
Start the engine, and look for a throttle handle.,
Unlock the controls.,
Move the bucket or front attachment up off the ground.,
Raise the attachment high enough to get a clear view of what is in front of you, set it down; raise it again, to get a feel for the movement of it.,
Push slowly ahead, or forward on the control sticks.,
Move the joysticks independently of one another.,
Practice moving the levers forward, then backward smoothly with the bucket in at a safe height in an open area until you have the feel of the machine and the controls.,
Drive the machine until you are comfortable with the steering operation, then approach a pile of material to practice using the loader bucket.

,
'Stop the machine just before you get to the pile of material, and lower the bucket to the ground with the front edge level.,
Park the machine, always set the buck down flat on the ground, and turn it off.",How to Operate a Skidloader," There are a number of manufacturers and sizes, with variations between them, but you may want to start with a Gehl brand or something like it.;
, The skid loader turns quickly, tips over easily, and changes directions very suddenly!

,, One thing you should notice is that the whole rear of the machine is a blind spot, since you are tucked away in a small compartment with machine wrapped completely around you.

, These may vary, but typically, there are two steering handles, one located on each side arm rest of the machine. These will each have control buttons for accessories, located on the tops or positioned like triggers on the forward side. Usually there is a diagram explain them on the console beside each stick, and now is the time to get an idea what they do, since when you are moving, pulling the wrong one or pushing the wrong button has immediate consequences!

, Pull the bar down until it locks in place, and fasten your seat belt if it has one. If the machine doesn't have either feature, now is the time to get out of the machine and leave it alone!

, The ignition is normally operated by a key similar to a car, but some have a starter button, and newer rental machines have a keypad you punch in a code on, but if you look around, you should be able to find where to start the engine.

, This will be a flat metal bar with a rubber grip, usually on the console to the right of the right arm rest with a slot to slide forward and backward in. There is usually a turtle image on one end of the slot, and rabbit on the other; we will start most of this practice in the TURTLE position., Many machines have an accessory lock out system. There will be toggle switches near the instrument panel with lock symbols below them, and often the will have a red lamp on when the switch is off, green when it is on. You will have to toggle the control switch to on to be able to begin operating the machine. This could involve buckling the seat belt or flipping a switch.

, This will mean pulling one of the control levers, or joysticks, in, toward the center of the machine, for instance, you will lean the left hand stick to the right, and this is usually the stick that raises and lowers the bucket. Because these joysticks have multiple functions, be care full not to move them diagonally, but either move straight right or left, or straight forward/backward! Also, some Case machines use your joysticks to control driving the machine and foot pedals to control boom lift and tilt control.

, If the left stick raises the bucket, the right stick will change the position of it. By leaning the right lever to the left, you will raise the front of the bucket in a scooping motion, and by going to the right with the right stick, you will dump it. Raise and lower the bucket, scoop and dump it, and get a feel for its motion.

, The machine will move forward, and if the throttle is in the idle, or turtle position, and you move each stick slowly and at the same speed, you will move smoothly in a straight line. When you pull back on the control levers, you will back up, and here you should remember, you have very little view of what is behind you!

, Pushing only the right stick will steer the machine to the left. Pushing on the left lever will steer the machine right. If you hold one lever forward, the machine will pivot in a circle the direction the tracks or tires are pushing it, while the stationary side ""skids"", hence the name skid steer.

, By moving one lever forward, and the other backward, you can spin the machine around in a circle the width of the machine.

,, Drive forward, pushing the loader into the pile of material, and roll the bucket back to scoop a load, stopping the forward motion as the bucket reaches the full back scoop position, back up, and raise the bucket to a safe carrying height. You may want to scoop the material, back up, and pull ahead and dump it back in the pile to practice. There is no ""voila!, I have it!"" to this step. The more you use the machine, the better you will get, but it takes many hours of operation to get good at it.

, Remove the seat belt and restraining bar, and exit the operator's compartment.

Clean your tools.,
Protect electrical cords.,
Lubricate tools.,
Inspect tools regularly.,
Store tools with care.",How to Maintain Construction Tools," Cleaning the tools regularly is essential to their proper functioning. After a day of work, your tools will be covered with some amount of dirt. It’s important to clean them after you’re finished using them. Although a thorough cleaning is not required on a daily basis, make sure you clean your tools regularly. When cleaning your tools, don’t use chemicals that are extremely harsh. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for proper cleaning and maintenance.;
, Airlines and electrical cords are prone to heavy damage since they are generally in the way of construction vehicles, and foot traffic. Other machinery like forklifts, drills, etc. can easily cut through wires. To keep the wires and airlines from getting damaged, it is important to protect them. You can cover the electrical cords with industrial strength casings or purpose-built ramps.

, Whether you work with pneumatic or regular tools, it is important to lubricate them regularly. Lubricating tools helps them to perform better and reduces wear and tear of components.


Lubrication is even more important when working with air or pneumatic tools. Pneumatic tools need to be lubricated once a day before use. When moisture or condensation enters the interiors of pneumatic tools, it can cause corrosion. Corrosion can decrease the life of an instrument. Corroded parts are difficult to repair and replace. Hence, the internal components of pneumatic tools should be coated with special air-tool oil. This oil prevents corrosion by displacing any moisture that enters the interior of the equipment.

, Regularly inspect your tools for signs of damage and faulty functioning. Inspections should take place at the end of each construction job. Ensure that you repair them immediately if there is any damage. This will avoid any last minute hassle.

, Storing tools properly is of prime importance. Although tools are designed for rough use, it is important to store them properly. Cover up your tools to keep dirt and rain away from the machine. If the tools aren’t used for a long time, inspect them regularly for signs of damage, wear and tear, corrosion, etc.

First you need to shut off the breaker to the pump.,
Locate and remove the top of the well head (cap).,
Shine a bright flashlight into the well head.,
Now that we know how to approach this removal, we can gather the tools we need.,
Screw the ""T"" tool into the top of the pitless adapter and disconnect the electrical connections.,
When you are ready, someone pulls up on the small cable that is the pitless adapter lock, and another person pulls up on the ""T"" tool.,
Now that the ""T"" tool has been removed, you can start pulling the flex pipe up.,
Once the well pump is out, you can start removing the old pump.,
When connecting a new pump, make sure that you have someone electrically knowledgeable or an electrical contractor make the connections.,
Now you are ready to install your new pump.,
Just like removal, use 2 people at the well head, and another person to walk the flex pipe towards the well head.,
Once you get to the pitless adapter, you will need to install your ""T"" tool once again.,
When the pitless adapter is secured, you will have not weight on the ""T"" tool, and it can be removed.,
Now you can reconnect the electrical connections at the top of the well, and again, if you don't feel comfortable doing this, consult an expert.

,
Before installing the cap, it is best to check to see if you have water.,
Install the well cap and you are done.

,
Your water should now be checked for bacteria and for ""softness"" by a certified water company since there is always a chance for bacteria to enter you water system.

",How to Replace a Submersible Well Pump," It would be best to make sure the pump is off by trying to run water. Remember that your bladder could still have water pressure in it. If water doesn't pass after 5 minutes, then you pump is off.;
, My cap was held in place with 3 - 1/4"" bolts, use 7/16"" wrench to remove.

, Here you will make some first conclusions on how to replace your pump. The first thing to notice is how the connection is to the house. It would either be a pitless adapter or a union. The other thing to check is if you have PVC or flex pipe for a water main pipe. The water connection might make it hard to see past it but a hint is white PVC is reflective, black flex pipe is not reflective and dull. My well has a pitless adapter and black flex pipe.

, You will need to make a 5' long ""T"" tool that is 1"" sch 40 pipe 5' long, threaded on both ends, with a T on one end and 2 6"" nipples, and when assembled makes a T. You will also need a 2lb hammer and at least 1 other person to assist you. 2 would be better since the flex pipe could be 200' long and can get hard to handle.

, You are ready for removal.

, Once the pitless adapter has been removed from the pipe, the person holding the lock cable can then grab the pitless adapter. Then you can remove the ""T"" tool from the pitless adapter. The 3/4"" HP pump that was currently in the hole weights about a total of 60 lbs when it is in water, meaning still deep inside the well tube.

, Have the second person walking the flex pipe out in a straight path. You will need 100' area if you have a 100' deep well. If you have a 3rd person, they can assist the first person with pulling out the well pump as it can get tiring for some people.


NOTE, the flex pipe will get slippery when you reach water level. The use of rubber grip gloves can be very helpful here, but is not necessary.

, You will need to match its specifications for the new pump. There are 2 different models, one with a control box, one without. Other than that, you must match Line Voltage (115 or 230 volt), Hz (50 or 60), Power in HP (horsepower) and Flow in GPM (Gallons Per Minute) or LPM (Liters Per Minute). When purchasing a new submersible pump, please remember how difficult and troublesome the job is and purchase the most reliable, well reviewed pump you can. Losing water because of a cheaper pump could cost you more in the long run.

, For example, a 230 volt pump with two black wires (two ""hots"") and 1 green wire (""ground""). When ready to make the electrical connections, make sure to put the heat shrink plastic onto each wire before making the crimp connections. Getting better crimp connectors than those supplied with your pump would be a good idea. Remember, you don't want to have to remove the pump once it is down in the pipe just because of a bad connection. Once crimped and securely in place, you need to place the heat shrink tubing over the crimp connectors. When in place, you need to add a good amount of heat to the tubing to make it shrink, a match or lighter will not be enough heat. I used a small propane torch. Once heat shrunk, tape the wires to the pipe to keep them from moving freely in the pipe. Add a 1/8"" stainless steel cable to the pump to make removal next time easier. To do this, you will need the amount of water pipe (100' in this example) plus an extra 10' to allow for loops and connection to a lift next time. You will also need 6 stainless steel cable clamps, use 3 at each end.

, You do not need to tape the cable to the water pipe, but you can. Place the pump near the hole and move the water flex pipe so it is in a straight line to the well head.

, Insert the pump into the hole, and slowly start the decent. When the pump hits the water level, it may reduce in weight. This is perfectly normal since items in water weigh less then in air.

, Have one person hold the pitless adapter and have someone else screw it in place. Then you can finish inserting the pitless adapter back into place.

, Please do not push hard to make sure it is seated properly since this can damage the well casing.

,, Connect a hose to the hose connection at the bladder tank, turn on, and shut off the water going to the house. Turn the breaker on to the pump. Your water should gurgle, this sound is what happens when air is being pushed around. If you do not have water after 5 minutes; shut off the breaker to the pump. This is not a problem, what you need to do is wait 5 minutes and allow the water that is being pumped up to settle into the pipe and force the air bubbles up. Then after 5 minutes or so, turn the breaker on and you should have good flowing water.

Remove any overgrowth, dying branches, or areas you intend to trim. Removing them now will prevent the leaves from blowing off and sticking to everything in your yard.


Aggressive trimming in the late summer will also reduce the cutting back you need to do over the winter. Be careful not to trim certain plants like berries or fruiting trees until after the last harvest.;
, If there is a hard to clean area of your landscape (think sculpture gardens, ponds, or rosebushes) place burlap or another material over the ground when the first leaves fall.


Weigh the area down with heavy rocks or ties to prevent the cloth from blowing away. Every few days fold the cloth in half and scoop the leaves out. Lay the cloth back down for as long as necessary.
This trick works great for trees that bear fruit you don’t harvest. Lay the tarpaulin under the tree to stop the berries and fruit from creating a large, impossible to clean mess.

, To prune your trees and plants, you will need a sharp pair of shears, a loppers, and a hand shears. If you’re pruning a plant larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter you may need a hand or electric saw as well.

, While most plants are pruned in the dormant season (late winter) some plants like hydrangeas grow their buds in the fall and need to be pruned in late summer. Follow any instruction cards you received with your plant.

, Remove any dead stems or leaves from your plant at the base of the plant, as these will not grow again. Removing them allows the plant to focus on new growth.


Also prune back any diseased or poor performing stems.

, When removing healthy stems to create shape, prune back as far as the branches or leaves to encourage healing. Don’t cut off the top.


New pruners often work from the top down to bring the plant to size before removing smaller growth. This will cause the plant to retain some of its unwanted growth and disfigure the plant over several years.
Instead, prune from the bottom of the plant and after removing the branches reduce the size to what you need.

, It's also possible to pick up the leaves up by hand. This is the most time-consuming method, but it definitely does work. However, this method is not advisable for anyone whose yard regularly contains more than a handful of stray leaves.

, Gardeners may also want to use a leaf stabber in harder to reach places. This mechanism typically has a straight handle and a spike on the bottom. Some garden centers sell these devices or one can make their own at home.


It’s easy to hammer a bent nail into an old broom handle or piece of wood, so that the nail pokes out of the end part. This homemade leaf stabber can be also used to pick up various forms of yard debris.

, In xeriscapes that have low-water lawns, gardeners can still remove their leaves using a rake. If the mulch or gravel covering the yard gets knocked out of place, it can easily be returned to its former area using the rake’s back side.

, Gardeners can also sweep the leaves up with a broom. This a good task to perform on days when the weather has been dry for a while. If one doesn't sweep too enthusiastically, the xeriscape mulch or gravel should remain in place while the leaves are being removed.

, Other gardeners have had some success using a leaf blower. This works for areas that don’t contain lightweight mulches, which will blow all over the place. Depending on the blower strength, even heavier materials may be moved about.


Therefore, if you plan on using a blower, you should be prepared to spend some time sweeping or raking your mulch back into shape.

, Gardeners will benefit from shredding the leaves prior to using them in compost or as mulch because this will help them to decompose more quickly. They can place the leaves in the compost pile or compost them separately.


Be aware that black walnut tree leaves and those from eucalyptus trees contain chemicals that inhibit plant growth and shouldn't be composted.

, When shredded, leftover leaves make an excellent mulch because they improve the soil quality and provide beneficial nutrients to a wide variety of plants.

, A number of garden centers sell paper bags specifically designed to hold lawn litter. Gardeners that don’t plan on using their leaves should put them in the aforementioned bags and leave the leaf-filled sacks out by the curb for the city’s disposal crews to collect.


Gardeners in rural areas may have to take their lawn debris to the county landfill themselves.

, Consider removing large plants that produce an excessive amount of leaves. While these plants may be lovely, if they're causing too much work you should consider replacing them with evergreen plants or statue gardens. Depending on the original plant you can usually find an evergreen that looks similar.

, This is an evergreen plant that produces edible berries and turns bright red in the winter. Shade-loving and drought-tolerant Oregon Grape is an excellent choice for low-maintenance xeriscaping.

, A popular evergreen shrub, junipers can be trained to nearly any size or need and function very well in xeriscaped lawns, even with very little natural rainfall.

, A large dramatic evergreen suited for curbs and borders. Standing nearly 2 feet (0.6 m) tall, this evergreen will bloom purple in the summer but does not lose its leaves in the fall, greatly reducing your workload as a result.

Ensure safety first.,
Lift the tire off of the ground.,
Remove the lug bolts.,
Remove the wheel from the tractor, lay it down on level ground (if possible), and remove valve stem core to fully deflate the tire.

,
Press the tire off the wheel inner rim bead so it can be taken off.,
Flip the tire over and break the bead loose on the outside of the wheel.

,
Place a support on the side of the tire.,
Use a tire iron or a pry bar to pry the tire's bead off the rim.,
Continue to work around the tire until the whole tire is pried off the rim.,
Remove the valve stem and stem locknut from the tube.

,
Pull the tube out of the wheel beginning at the valve stem and working around the rim.

,
Place the tube on top of the tire so it is in the same position it was in when it was inside the tire.,
Replace the valve stem and inflate the tube so you can look for the leak.,
Deflate tube and place it on a comfortable, flat working surface.,
Get out (or go purchase) your patch kit.,
Apply rubber cement to the area you've buffed, then wipe off the excess glue.,
Peel the patch backing material off the patch.,
Place the patch over the damaged spot on the tube, being careful not to allow it to wrinkle.,
Check the sidewall near the location where the tube was damaged before replacing the tube.,
Install a boot on any large holes or split sidewall areas of the tire.,
Reinstall the tube in the tire.,
Use your tire tool or pry bars to pull the tire back onto the rim.,
Replace the valve stem core and inflate the tire.,
Make sure the tire's bead is in line with the edge of the rim as the air pressure forces the bead into place on the rim.,
Lift the tire back up and roll it close to the axle hub where it will be mounted.,
Tighten the lug bolts securely.,
Check the tire pressure with a gauge.",How to Repair a Backhoe Tire," Always support any vehicle safely when removing or installing wheels.


If possible, get a helper. Tractor tires are heavy to work with. If you're able, get assistance.
Be conscious at all times that pry bars can slip and cause serious injury. Use with great care.;
, On a backhoe, the stabilizer can be used for this job on rear tires, or the loader bucket for front wheels.

, Using a pneumatic impact wrench can speed up this process.

,, With a backhoe, you may be able to complete this step with the digging bucket. If necessary, use a tire hammer to break the tire's bead loose.

,, Use a wood block so the tire will rise up from the rim as it's pried off.

, Start near the valve stem and work around the tire, heading away from the stem to keep from pinching it.

, Then block the tire up higher so the tube (if the tire has a tube) can be removed.

,,, This will allow you to look for problems with the tire itself when you locate the leak in the tube.

, Using a spray bottle with soapy water will help you find small punctures, but obvious damage may not require this technique.

, A truck tailgate or a worktable is good for this.

, Make sure you know exactly where the damaged spot on the tire is, then buff an area with a buffing tool to roughen up the rubber. Work around the puncture or damaged location so the patch will fit within the roughened area.

, Allow it to dry until it's no longer glossy. Do not wait too long to apply the patch, or the glue may dry completely and lose its adhesion.

, Take care not to touch the surface of the patch underneath it.

,


Push the patch or roll it with a patch roller to make sure it's well bonded to the tube.

, You may find an old nail, wood splinter or other object still embedded in the tire, or you could see a damaged area that will need attention before replacing the tube.

, This will prevent the tube from being damaged when the tire is reinflated.

, Make sure the valve stem is aligned with the hole in the rim where it will fit. Push the valve stem through the hole made of it, and replace the retaining nut that will hold it in place as the tire is remounted on the rim.

, Start near, but not directly in line with, the valve stem, then work around the rim moving away from the valve stem to prevent pinching the tube.


Continue around the tire until it is reinstalled completely on the rim.

, You will hear air escaping from the cavity between the tube and tire as the tube inflates, but don't worry about it, as this is normal.

, This will help prevent a blow-off, where the air pressure might accidentally blow a part of the tire off the wheel assembly.

, Adjust the height of the tire so the wheel will fit the hub, then align the lug bolt holds and install the lug bolts.

, To make sure the wheel fits the hub properly, criss-cross the hub tightening bolts across from each other rather than working a circular pattern.

, Let the tire back on the ground, and clean up your tools.

Check out the machine you're going to operate.,

Read the operator's manual of the machine you will operate.,

Climb up on the machine you have chosen.,
Crank the engine, allowing it to warm up for a few minutes before attempting to engage the transmission or operating any controls.,
Check to make sure all attachments are clear of the ground, including the stabilizers, the front bucket, and the backhoe boom.,
Release the parking brake, and shift the transmission into forward, then drive it slowly around while you get the hang of steering and braking the machine.,
Raise and lower the front end loader bucket (if equipped) to get the feel of it.,

Park the machine in an area suitable for practice digging with the backhoe.,Set the throttle to rev the engine to about 850 Rotations Per Minute (not too fast until you get the hang of the controls).,
Lower the stabilizers until they raise the rear of the tractor so the back wheels no longer touch the ground, then lower the front bucket to its limit, raising the front wheels also.,
Unlock the back boom.,
Push the left lever further outward after the boom is unlocked to lower the main boom, or nearest section of the backhoe boom.,

Position the bucket over the spot you want to begin digging, then push the right control stick to the right to open the bucket for scooping, then lower the main boom to engage the soil.,
Raise the boom with the left control arm by pulling it.,
Swing the bucket to the side you're going to dump the load of dirt you scooped from the hole by pushing the left control lever in the direction you want the boom to swing.,
Swing the bucket back to the starting position by pushing the left control stick the direction you want the boom to go, then repeat the process.",How to Operate a Backhoe," There are two obvious reasons for doing this: one is so you're familiar with the machine, and the other is to make sure it is suitable for the job.

Look at the location of the operator's controls, understanding that the machine is operated from a forward and backward facing position.

Facing forward, you will see a steering wheel, shifter, front loader control lever, brake pedals (left and right independent brakes), gas pedal, and control switches for accessories like lights, emergency flashers, horn, emergency brake actuator, ignition switch, gauges, and other items. From this position, a backhoe looks very similar to other tractors.
Facing the rear (the seat swivels 180 degrees), you should see the boom controls. There are two different boom control configurations, the three stick that includes foot controls to swing the bucket, and the joystick controls, that operate all the backhoe boom controls with two joysticks. Also, there will be two auxiliary controls, either mounted paired on one side of the seat, or in front of the boom control sticks, that raise and lower the stabilizers.


Look at the safety equipment. Experienced backhoe operators check the safety equipment at the beginning of each shift to make sure it is in good condition. This requires some knowledge of how the safety equipment works, but even a novice should be able to observe things like the seat belt condition, the fire extinguisher charge, and be able to see obvious damage such as cracked members in the rollover protection system and missing guards.
Look at the general condition of the machine. Check the tires to make sure they are properly inflated and show no outward signs of damage, look for oil leaks, damaged hydraulic hoses, and other obvious signs of abuse or dangerous conditions.
Look at the size of the machine. Backhoes range in size from small attachments for lawn tractors, to machines weighing over 12,000 pounds with turbo-charged diesel engines. You will have to decide how large a machine you will need to perform the project you have in mind.
Look at other features of the machine you will operate, like air conditioning, four wheel drive, extend-a-hoes, and the various special attachments available on these machines.;
, There are substantial differences in backhoes, from the location of controls to the actual cranking procedure and the gauge cluster location. Obviously, this article is general in nature and doesn't cover every make and model of backhoes; each backhoe has its own features with which you should be familiar., Sit down in the seat, buckle the seat belt, and take a long, slow look around to see what the clearances of the different different parts of the machine are, and where the various controls are located. Avoid dry runs on the controls, as many parts may move when levers or controls are moved, even if the engine is not running., This warming-up time will ensure that the hydraulic fluid will begin to circulate and warm up., If you need to raise them to allow the machine to be driven, use the controls delicately until you have a feel for them. This is especially true of the back boom, since raising or swinging it without the stabilizers down can shake the tractor violently., Running in low or second gear while practice driving the machine is a good idea; even experienced operators only use third or high gear on very smooth, flat surfaces, since the balance of the machine makes it difficult to steer at high speeds., The control lever for this attachment is located on the operator's left while sitting facing forward. Pulling straight toward the rear raises the bucket, pushing straight forward lowers it, pulling it toward the center of the machine scoops, and pushing outward dumps it., Make sure you have plenty of clearance both to the rear and the sides of the machine, since the boom swings left and right 180 degrees, and has a reach of up to 18 feet (5.4 meters).,, You may find you have to lower one stabilizer further than the other to level the rear of the machine, depending on whether you're on a slope, or if the soil is less stable on one side than the other., Do this by pulling forward (toward you, and the front of the tractor) on the left control lever, then pushing if away from you when it pauses at the highest point, while holding the unlocking lever (usually on the right floor board) with your foot., Push outward on the right lever to extend the lower boom (outer section, with the bucket attached) away from you (this will actually raise the second boom) so that the bucket is extending outward., Push the left lever to lower the boom into the soil, while pulling the right lever to drag the bucket into the soil in a scooping motion, then begin rolling the bucket forward by moving the right control lever to the left. You will find with practice that you start to coordinate these movements, to achieve a fluid movement of the backhoe., Usually you raise the bucket with the right control by swinging it to your left to keep it filled while you lift it from the hole., Once you have the load over the spot you want to dump it, just push the right lever to your left and the buck will open, allowing its contents to dump out., Practicing this operation is the basic and safe way of learning how to operate the backhoe."

Drain fuel if it has been sitting.,
Determine if fuel in or added to the tank contains ethanol.,
Use fuels during the same season it is purchased.,
Inspect spark plugs.,
Inspect the air filter.,
Apply starting fluid to the air intake.,
Inspect fuel filter.",How to Start a Sputtering Snowblower Engine," If fuel is stagnated (sitting more than a couple of months) in the tank or storage container, it should not be used. When fuel sits without a stabilizer, it begins to break down and will not burn as readily as ""fresh"" gasoline. If this is the first running of the snow blower with the same gas since last winter, the gas is stagnated. Siphon fuel from the tank or open the fuel line at any convenient point between the tank and the carburetor to allow the fuel to drain into a container at least as large as the tank. Refill tank with fresh fuel as required by the equipment.;
, If not, add Drygas (or equivalent) fuel additive to keep any moisture (water) in the fuel system from freezing. Fuels consisting of an ethanol blend do not need this additive because the ethanol performs the same function. The ethanol combines with moisture to prevent it from freezing - and allows it to enter the combustion chamber where it is passed with exhaust gasses.

, In the many areas that experience wide variations of seasonal temperatures, retailers sell fuels with modified formulas that help compensate for these variations. Fuels purchased in the spring, summer and fall do not work as well as those formulated and made available for purchase in winter months.

, Replace with new, properly gaped spark plugs if needed. If a replacement spark plug is not available, the old spark plug may be cleaned with an old rag. Once clean and dry, prepare to remove dirt and any deposits left on the electrode surfaces by folding a fine grit sandpaper or emery cloth so both sides are rough. Slide the paper / cloth in the gap (between the electrodes), back and forth several times. Clean any deposits from the white ceramic insulator around the center electrode with a small sharp tool. Remove any left over grit and debris from the spark plug by spraying electrical contact cleaner, blowing off with compressed air or wiping clean with a rag. Reinstall the spark plug. Do not over tighten.

, Replace or vacuum if dirty or clogged. Clogged air filters reduce the air required by the carburetor from reaching the combustion chamber, and results in difficulty starting, rough running and black exhaust smoke. Typically, the air filter on a snow blower will long outlast its summertime counterparts, as there are significantly fewer particles of dirt, grass, leaves, pollen, etc. to be deposited on the filter in the wintertime.

, Spray starting fluid optionally with the air filter removed, directly into the carburetor. Starting fluid is a highly flammable liquid that can ignite easier than gasoline. Use only as directed by the label on the can. An alternative that works well is to place a 100 watt lamp near the air cleaner for a few minutes. This warms the air and fuel and helps it vaporize and is much safer than ether.

, As suggested above, power equipment that is used in sub-freezing temperatures can suffer from moisture in fuel and lines becoming frozen. If unable to start after replacing fuel, the fuel filter may be clogged with ice. Remove the filter to a warm area. Wipe the filter body clean and dry. Inspect for cracks. View while thawing. Look for liquid draining from locations other than where fuel lines connect. Fuel leaking from other places indicates cracks in the filter body. Drain all fluid and discard filter if there is any evidence of cracks; otherwise reinstall. While a cracked filter should be replaced as soon as possible, it may be possible to connect the fuel line to the carburetor directly (if it is long enough and correct diameter). This is a temporary fix only.

Pick a location for your decking.,
Lets say your decking is going to be in the middle of your back garden, freestanding with no handrail or steps.,
Check that the ground is level or close to level.,
Clear the area you will be covering and lay down landscaping cloth or a weed barrier.,
Build your subframe, Cut 2 lengths of 6x2 at 12 feet (3.7 m).,
Once all your cutting is complete the frame can be nailed or screwed together.,
Fix your deck to its supports with brackets, braces or stakes and recheck that its slightly off level to the side.,
Lay your decking.,
Once all the boards are screwed down you can run a circular saw down the two sides to leave a uniform overhang of 15-30mm all round.,
Oil and use it.",How to Build Simple Square Decking," Take measurements and decide simple factors like, do you want it connected to the house, do you require posts, spindles, and handrail and will it require stairs. Also you may consider different species of wood as each has different properties and some require less maintenance than others.
, If your decking is 12 feet (3.7 m) x 12 feet (3.7 m) then ensure you buy 14 feet (4.3 m) lengths to reduce cost and waste. You will also need 6""x2"" lengths for the subframe., If it is spot on then the decking can be laid straight down on top without the need of supports. If it is not level then digging in one area or supporting in another may be necessary. The easiest way to support a deck this size without posts is to dig five holes. One at each corner and one in the middle. These holes can be filled with combinations of sand/shingle and blocks, or with concrete. Take into consideration the soils integrity when choosing a method. If your soil is solid then two blocks, sand and shingle may suffice. If your soil is bad then maybe consider a slightly larger hole filled in with concrete. Decking with posts and handrail can be supported by digging holes, placing the posts in plumb and filling with concrete. Remember that your deck needs to be off level slightly to allow rainwater to flow off its edge. Water flow should move the same direction as the decking surface. Supporting blocks or infills can be levelled with a straight edge and a level sitting on top., Failure to take this step will result in grass and weeds appearing up through the deck at a later stage. Once you have this laid, cover sparingly with gravel to keep it in place., Hold the two side by side and mark 16"" centres. Count how many markings you have and add 2 for either end. In this case you require 13 internals. Now cut the internals by subtracting 4"" (thickness of two externals) from 144""(12 ft) leaving you with 140"", Make sure that any humps in the wood are pointing up and that all the butt joints are tight. Now you need to cut two lines of brigers. Mark the two outside internals at 4 feet (1.2 m) and 8 feet (2.4 m). Strike a the two lines and screw or nail your noggins either side of the line. Once this is complete your deck frame can be fixed into location. NOTE. Only use galvanized nails or decking screws, 4"" preferably., Once the frame is in position you can start cutting the decking for the outside perimeter to hide the the subframe. Cut your perimeter boards at 45 degrees angles to butt together at the corners and screw into place. NOTE. Use decking screws as they are specially coated for this job. Normal screws may decay and snap over time causing twisting. If the board thickness is 30mm then 70mm screws are ideal., Place the first board down with an overhang of 15-30mm along the edge and overhanging evenly either end (this end waste will be cut straight once all boards are fixed). Some people don't use an overhang but it looks better and allows rainwater to drip free from the face in the same way an external windowsill prevents water dripping down a wall. If you don't like this method then screw it flush. Allow a constant gap of 3mm-8mm for expansion between the boards as they will absorb water in the winter and dry out and shrink in the summer. Failure to do this will result in the boards lifting, splitting and not drying out. This will lead to rotting and a very short life expectancy., You have the option of rounding these ends with a plane or a router is required., Just remember to treat it or oil it at least once a year or ideally every six months."

Familiarize yourself with the components of a set of steps.",How to Build Porch Steps1,"


The rise is the height of porch, or the steps, that you will need.
A run is the total length of the steps from the edge of the porch to where the steps end.
Stringers are usually 2 x 12-inch (5.1 x 30.5 cm) treated wood boards to which the tread and riser are attached.
The treads are 2 x 6-inch (5.1 x 15.2 cm) treated or composite wood boards that lay parallel to each other to form a single step that is approximately 10.5 inches (26.7 cm) wide.
You will attach a riser, a 1 x 8-inch (2.5 X 20.3 cm) board, resembling a toe board, to the back or upright section of the step. Most steps are 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) in height.;

Know your local building codes regarding decking.,
Obtain any necessary permits.,
Know the depth of the frost line in your area.,
Decide on the size, style and placement of your deck.,
Choose the materials to make your deck from.",How to Build a Deck1," The size of your home will have an impact on how large your deck can be, as well as its shape. In most cases, your deck will also be required to support a greater load than the floors in your home.









Your home owner's insurance policy may not cover an accident that occurs on your deck if you didn't build your decking to comply with the building codes in your area.;
, Check with your local government agency regarding the need for a permit before building your deck, as well as any inspections that will be required during construction.








, The frost line is the depth to which the ground freezes in winter, taken over an average of a number of years. Some building codes require that when you build a deck, the support posts be sunk to a depth below the frost line. Even if it isn't required, sinking the support posts to this depth will keep the deck from buckling when the ground expands and swells when the water in it freezes.








, Your deck can either be free-standing or attached to the house. Although some building codes may be more relaxed on free-standing decks, most people find it more convenient to have their decks attached to the house.









If you build your deck onto the house, you'll want to know where the rim joists and wall studs are located so you can secure the deck's ledger board, the support beam that attaches it to the house, to either of them.
The size of your deck will determine the number of footings and posts you'll need to support the joists and deck boards, as well as the size and spacing of the joists and the size of the deck boards. Joists can be spaced 12, 16 or 24 inches (30, 40 or 60 centimeters) apart, however a spacing of 24 inches is most common; common sizes for joists and deck boards are listed under ""Things You'll Need.""
The height at which you build your deck determines whether you need to include railings, posts and steps. You won't need them for a deck built just above the ground, but you will if it is higher than that.
Making a preliminary sketch of what you have in mind will help you in lining up materials and construction advice.

, There are a number of hardwoods and composite materials from which you can build your deck. Materials for deck boards range from the tropical Hardwood Ipe and plastic to the more traditional redwood, cedar and pine. The framing, columns and posts, however, should be pressure-treated or otherwise decay-resistant wood as required by code.

Calculate the run of the steps (how long they will be).

,
Measure from the bottom of the level to the ground using a 4-foot (1.2 m) level set on the top of the porch.,
Multiply 5 steps by 10.5 inches (26.7 cm).,
Lay out the steps to be cut from the stringer using a carpenter's square.,
Place the square along the edge of the stringer and mark out the 5 steps beginning at the end.

,
Use a circular saw to cut out the steps and square up the ends of the stringer to the steps.,
Take the first stringer you cut out and use it as a pattern.,
Attach the stringers to the porch using metal stringer hangers and 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) deck screws.,
Connect the riser board (cut to the length and width needed) using 2.5-inch (6.4 cm) deck screws.

,
Install the 2 x 6-inch (5.1 X 15.2 cm) treads (again cut to length) parallel to each other with 1/8 inch (3 mm) spacing between the boards.

,
Attach the treads to the stringers using 2.5-inch (6.4 cm) deck screws.

,
Finish it with waterproof deck stain or exterior porch paint.

",How to Build Porch Steps2,",


Take the total height and divide it by the height of the riser. This tells you the number of steps you will need.
Remember that the riser height averages between 6 and 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) high. As an example, a height of 35 inches (88.9 cm) divided by a 7-inch (17.8 cm) riser will result in 5 equal steps.

, That will give you the run (or length) of steps from the face of the porch to the end of the steps. In this case, the run is 52.5 inches (1.33 m).

,


Have the square set up by clamping a straight edge at the 7-inch (17.8 cm) mark on the short outside section of the square.
The long outside section of the square, at that point, will be at the 10.5-inch (26.7 cm) mark.

,, Note that you will not cut all the way through with the circular saw. Finish the cut with a hand saw or jigsaw.

, Now, mark out the other stringers you need. The spacing of the stringers should not be more than 16-inches (40.6 cm) apart for strength. You would need 4 stringers on a 4-foot-wide (1.2 m) stair.

,


Check to make sure that they are plumb and level to each other as you go.
The bottoms of the stringers need to be sitting on a concrete pad or brick base and not on bare ground.

Mark the place where the top of the deck is to go.,
Mark the place where the bottom of the deck is to go.,
Remove the siding from where the ledger board will be mounted.",How to Build a Deck2," Usually, this will be the height of the interior floor and just below the threshold of any planned or current door that will open onto the deck. Use a level to draw a line on the siding the whole length of the deck.








, From the line you just marked, measure down the thickness of the deck boards (usually 1 to 1 1/2 inches, or 2.5 to 3.75 centimeters), plus the height of the ledger board. (If the ledger board is a 2 x 10, this will be 9.5 inches, or 23.75 centimeters.) Mark this line across the entire length of where the ledger board will go.








, If the siding is solid siding, you can cut it away with a circular saw and jigsaw, provided you don't cut into the sheathing beneath the siding. If the siding is vinyl siding, you'll need a special tool to pry up the siding; after removing it, you'll need to re-mark the lines for top of the deck and the bottom of the ledger board on the sheathing.









Ignore the steps in this section if you're planning to make a free-standing deck.

If you plan to cover your house's rim joists with the deck's skirting board, cut the ledger board shorter to accommodate the width of the skirting board (usually 3/4 inch, or 1.9 centimeters) on either side.

, First, mark off the deck's rim joists on the left edge of the ledger board. (These are usually 2 joists laid side-by-side for strength.) Then, mark the centers of where each intervening joist will go and measure half the joist's thickness from each of these marks on either side. Then, mark off the rim joists on the right edge of the ledger board. Draw lines across the ledger board surface to mark all the joist edges.








, Cut the beam the same length as the ledger board. If you plan to have the joists butt flush against this beam (a flush beam), then use a framing square to align the edges of both beams and then copy the marks in full. If you plan to have the joists rest on this beam instead (a dropped beam), you'll only need to have marks across the top for reference.









Most building codes require the opposite beam to be twice or three times as thick as the interior joists, so as with the rim joists, you'll have to cut multiple beams and sandwich them side-by-side. (If the deck is to be a free-standing deck, the ledger board beam would also have to be sandwiched with one or two other beams for strength.)

, Check the spacing of the joist hangers with a scrap of wood the width of the joists, then nail the joist hangers in place with short, thick nails designed to secure the joists. If your opposite beam is to be a flush beam, you'll also want to attach joist hangers to the innermost member of that beam.








, Tack the board in place temporarily with nails. Drill 1 or 2 holes between where every 2 joists will go. Apply silicone caulk to the inside of each hole, then sink a lag screw into each hole to secure the ledger board permanently. Cover the ledger board with a waterproof membrane or galvanized metal flashing.









Ignore this step if the deck is to be a free-standing deck.

, You can lay out the positions for the footings using string and stakes or batter boards to form a grid. Mark the footing positions on the strings, then transfer them to the ground. Dig 6 inches (15 centimeters) below the frost line for each footing with either a post-hole digger or power auger; make the bottom of each hole wider than the top.









You may need to have the holes inspected for depth before you can pour the concrete.

, Place one in each hole and support it with loose back-fill, then trim all the piers level to support the posts evenly. Pour concrete into the holes and let it set for at least 24 hours before preceding.








, To anchor the posts in place, set 6-inch (15-centimeter) lengths of stainless steel rod or rebar halfway into the piers to serve as drift pins and drill holes in the post bottoms before placing them. You can also cover the pier tops with adhesive before setting the posts if the tops are wooden or use anchor brackets if the tops are concrete. Plumb the posts to be level and affix temporary braces to keep the posts from moving until the framing is in place.








, If your posts are tall, you may have to raise the individual members of the beam one by one instead of together. Set the beam members such that the outermost member is flush with the edge of the post. Attach the innermost member beam with toe nails or whatever connector your building codes require.








, Connect the rim joists to the ledger board and innermost member of a flush opposite beam with inside corner brackets. Adjust the beam member to get it square if it isn't, then affix the reinforcing outer beam members to the innermost member with nails, screws or lag bolts.








, Sight down each joist edge to look for any signs of bowing (crowning). Slip them into the joist hangers on the ledger board and opposite flush beam (or atop an opposite dropped beam), crowned side up. Tap them in place if necessary, and if they're too tight, trim a bit off the ends so they slip in without excessive force. If the opposite beam is a dropped beam, toenail the joists in place.








, Measure the deck frame from the outside edge of one rim joist to the outside edge of the other and add the width of any skirting or length of any overhang to it. Cut the first two deck boards to this length, then cut off the length of any overhang from the board that will be laid next to the house. (Subsequent boards need not be cut to this length, but can be laid down first and cut flush with the first two boards later.) Set the first board against the house sheathing and the next board against it if wet and the width of a 16-penny nail apart from it if dry. Attach the boards to the joists with two nails or screws. Straighten the boards as you go with a flat bar.









If you're building a wide deck, you can cut multiple deck boards to span the distance between the rim joists, with the places where two boards meet falling in the middle of a joist. Stagger these joints between each row of decking to make the deck look nicer.
Periodically measure the distance from the front of the deck to each end of the last board laid. They should be equal; if not, decrease the gaps between boards slightly on the longer side and increase them slightly on the shorter side until the distances are equal again.
If the last deck board is wider than the space to lay it, either narrow it or use a narrower board of the same type of decking material. If the board is narrower than the space available, take a wider board and narrow it as necessary.
The photo shows the deck planks running parallel to the joists, they should under no circumstances be laid in this fashion. Instead lay them perpendicular to the joists.

, If your deck is high enough to require stairs, determine the number of steps you'll need by dividing the deck height in feet by seven. If the quotient is a whole number, use the quotient as the number of steps, with a rise of 7 inches (17.5 centimeters). If the quotient includes a fraction, round to the nearest whole number to get the number of steps and divide that number into the deck height to get the rise in inches. Divide the rise into 75 to get the approximate length for each step.









You'll need to have a stringer at either end of the staircase to attach the steps to and another stringer in the center if you have a wide or tall staircase. Lay the first stringer out with a framing square to find the rise and run, then transfer the marks to the other stringers. Cut out the step supports, then brace the stringers together and nail them to the deck's rim joist before securing them permanently with lag screws.
Cut the steps to have a 3/4-inch (1.9-centimeter) overhang to either side of the stringer assembly to channel rain away from the stringers. Attach them to the stringers with screws or nails.

, If your deck is more than a step high, you'll want or need to have deck railings to prevent falls. Begin by installing the corner and stair posts, plumbing them and securing them first with glue, then with either lag screws or carriage bolts. The remaining pieces  top rails, bottom rails and spindles  may be attached individually or assembled into sections and then installed as units.









Measure the distance between posts to find the length of the rails and cut them to that length.
Vertical spindles usually need to be spaced to more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) apart and should be placed closer together if it will create even spacing over the entire deck. They can be attached to the rails with nails or screws, while the rails themselves attach to the posts with angle screws. (Use wooden blocks to prop up the rail sections while screwing them in.)
Cut the stair posts to the correct height and angle with the help of a framing square, then install the bottom stair rails and hand rails. Figure the length of the stair rails by dividing the stair rise by the run, multiplying by the deck rail length, squaring the result, adding the square of the deck rail length and take the square root of the result. Cut the spindles to the right length, angled for the slope of the rail and install as described above for the deck spindles.

, Cut the boards to cover the deck's beam and rim joists and nail them in place.

Decide the layout concerning the placement of posts or pillars in relation to the walls.,
Place the first set of corner blocks, making sure that the long side is facing out.,
Proceed to the second corner, placing the corner block in the opposing direction.,
Build the walls, beginning with the wall adjacent to the post, working away from the corner until you meet the area where the post will be placed.,
Layer the bricks in an overlapping manner to avoid continuous vertical seams.

,
Proceed with the wall that will be adjacent to the house, ending with a split block.,
Construct the posts, using four corner blocks.,
Continue to layer blocks until you've reached your desired height.

,
Finish the posts with post caps, applying a small amount of masonry adhesive to the top brick to secure the cap.

,
Complete the walls with wall caps, alternating the caps so that every other cap has the wide side facing out, and vice versa.,
Screen your porch if your goal is to increase your home's living space, considering whether there is a ceiling already present.

,
Add support posts to the structure.,
Measure and cut lumber strips into eight pieces for each frame.,
Nail the front of the frame to the back of the frame, putting the screen between them.

,
Trim any excess screen material with a utility knife.",How to Build a Patio Enclosure," Mark these areas with landscaping paint.


Always begin in the corners and work out in both directions. This will afford you the opportunity to make adjustments as needed.;
, Place the longer end of a divided splitting block so that the split edge meets the corner block, making a tight seal.

, Place the remainder of the splitting block, again using the split side to meet the corner block.

, End with a split block so you can alter the size, avoiding any gaps. Face the split end so that it will meet the post.

,, Place the split side against the house.

, Align them to be centered in relation to the wall panels. Layer the bricks in the same fashion as the walls.

,,, This will avoid any gaps

,, This can be accomplished by installing 2"" x 4"" (5cm x 10cm) wooden studs, securing them to the floor and the roof with screws.

, Construct the frames; one for the front and one for the back of screen section, using carpenter's adhesive and screws.

,,


Repeat for as many frames as necessary.
After testing the fit of each frame into the porch, attach to the rails and posts using 3 inches (7.62 cm) screws.
In order to improve the look and durability of your screens, finish by installing trim strips.

"
Decide on a material for your deck railings.,
Comply with any local building codes.,
Look for rails that are from 36 to 42 inches (91 to 107 cm) high.,
Consider your view.,
Think about your privacy.,
Choose railings that can be easily installed.,
Shop around for deck railings, so you have an idea of what your options are.,
Consider your budget.,
Talk to a builder about making custom deck rails.",How to Choose Deck Railings," Choose between iron, wood, glass, vinyl or a combination of materials to construct your railing.


Select wood railings if you want something traditional and easy to work with. Using wood, you can create any kind of designs or patters that you want to fit with and match your deck.
Use iron railings if you want something durable and easy to maintain. You can find iron railings in many different designs, or have them custom made if you have something specific in mind.
Choose vinyl deck railings if you want something that is easy to clean and care for. Vinyl can withstand any weather conditions and does not need to be stained or treated. It also will not rust.
Go with glass railings for something trendy and unique. Most glass balusters and railings are tempered to prevent damage. The glass can be frosted or opaque.;
, There may be codes and regulations in your area that regulate the construction of your deck railings.


Get a building permit if your deck is more than 24 inches (61 cm) off the ground.
Make sure your rails are no more than 4 inches (10 cm) apart. This will prevent children from slipping through the rails.

, Anything shorter can be unsafe.

, If you want to enjoy looking at your view while sitting on your deck, look for railings that you will easily be able to see through.

, If you have neighbors who live close enough to see onto your deck, look for railings that will protect your privacy, or consider getting a screen.

, Make sure you are able to install them properly, or hire a professional.

,


Look at selections of deck railings in home improvement stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot.
Search online retailers for a larger selection, and more competitive pricing. Decks.com is a good place to start.

, Depending on the material and design, deck railings come with a wide range of prices. You can pay as low as $15 per foot to over $100 per foot.

, The company that installed your deck might have ideas about rails. If you have a certain design or look in mind that you cannot find on the market, have them designed for you.

Include certain basic or nominal features, such as a minimum width of 48 inches (1200 mm), tread of 10.5 inches (275 mm), and a height of the riser or step of approximately 7-to-8 inches (175-to-200 mm) in your design.,
Measure the height of the stair from the bottom of the decking -- or top of the floor joist -- to the ground and then divide by the 7-to-8 inches (175-to- 200 mm).,
Lay out the steps on the stringer, using 2 x 12-inch (50 x 304 mm) treated wood, with a framing square.,
Cut the riser and steps out with a circular saw, but stop just short of cutting through.,
Install the stringers by attaching them at the top of the deck outside the framing using metal floor joist hangers.",How to Build Deck Stairs," The stair stringers should not be more than 16 inches (400 mm) apart. Set the foot on either a 6 x 6-inch (150 x 150 mm) treated wood timber or roofing paper (if set upon concrete) to prevent rot.


Ideally, the stair tread should be built from a composite wood material designed for exterior decking for its durability.;
, This will give you the number of steps you will need to make.

Adjust the height until the height and steps balance out (since you can't have a half or quarter of a step). Take the number of steps and multiply that by 10.5 inches (266.7 mm). That gives you the length of stair stringer necessary. Take that length and project it out from the deck. Now you have the location for the footing of the stair.

, Set the riser for the height determined by your math and the step by 10 inches (250 mm).

, Use a hand saw to finish the cut.

, Establish the riser boards using 1-inch (25 mm) thick treated wood screws beginning at the bottom riser.


Stringers and risers put into place begin with installation of the treads using composite wood designed for decks (best used for durability and strength). This decking, made from specially prepared compressed wood particles comes in what is referred to as 5/4 thickness. This is 1.25 inches (32 mm) thick and comes in variable widths. Secure all with 3"" (75 mm) deck screws.

Determine if the project you are planning justifies the expense of renting an aerial lift.,
Get quotes from several rental companies if you are renting your aerial lift.,
Check with the rental company about renter's insurance, delivery and pickup fees, cleaning and refueling charges, and other costs associated with the equipment rental.,
Obtain whatever tools and materials you need to perform the work you plan to do using the aerial lift.,
Familiarize yourself with the lift when it is delivered.,
Check the condition of the lift.,
Turn the remote key switch to Platform Control at the ground control panel.,
Make sure the red kill switch button is pulled out at the ground control panel.

,
Put on a suitable fall arrest harness.,
Climb into the work basket (platform), latch the gate, and fasten the fall arrest lanyard to the D ring provided on the platform.

,
Check to make sure all control identification on the console is readable.,
Pull the red kill switch button out to enable the engine start switch and power up the console.,
Push the engine start switch.,
Stop and take a moment to thoroughly scan the area above and around you, looking specifically for power lines or other hazards.

,
Look on the platform floor for a boot like enclosure.,
Toggle the boom control joystick to raise the boom.,
Swing the platform to familiarize yourself with this motion/function.,
Telescope the boom out and in by toggling the control indicated for this feature.,
Familiarize yourself with the rest of the aerial lifts controls, such as the platform rotate control and the platform tilt control.,
Drive the machine to get the feel of the steering/drive controls.,
Use the right (usually) joystick to engage the drive wheels.,
Become familiar with all the machine's controls and functions before approaching a structure or position from which you plan to work.",How to Operate an Aerial Lift," If you can make do with a ladder or scaffolding, you will likely save a lot of money.;
, Determine if the machine you rent (or purchase) is suitable for the terrain it will operate on and have sufficient reach and capacity for the work it is intended to do. Here are some items to ask about when dealing with the rental company:


Weight capacity. Aerial lifts can raise a load of between 500 and 1000 pounds. If more than one person will be needed in the basket, along with their tools, a larger capacity lift will probably be needed.
Fuel type. Aerial lifts typically use either gasoline, diesel, or liquefied petroleum gas (propane, for example). You will want to choose a lift that you can obtain fuel for if you plan to use it extensively.
Terrain type. Aerial lifts come in either two wheel drive or four wheel drive, and have different tire treads (or even bulldozer-like tracks for soft or sandy soils). If your project will be done on sloping or very soft ground, an aerial lift might not be a good choice at all.
Reach. Aerial lifts range from 30 feet (9.1 m) to over 100 feet (30.5 m) in vertical reach. They also can extend horizontally, but telescoping out at a low boom angle reduces the lift's weight capacity and stability.

, These hidden costs can more than double the price quoted.

, This is especially important if you are renting the lift, as slowdowns may occur if you have to shop for these items after you begin the job.

, In the United States, OSHA requires that all aerial lifts operated by an employee in his course of work must have an operator's manual located on the equipment. Taking a look at all the controls, and reviewing their function in the operator's manual will give you a basic understanding of how the particular lift you are going to use operates.

, This should be done upon accepting delivery of a machine from a rental company as well, since you may be responsible for any damage that occurs to the lift while you are using it. An inspection of the machine should be made at the beginning of each day's use to insure it is safe to operate. Here are the general items to look at:


Fuel level. If you are working in the basket and the machine runs out of fuel, you may be stranded if no one is around to use the auxiliary controls to lower the machine from the ground control panel.
Tire condition. Never operate an aerial lift with underinflated tires, or tires showing damage which may cause them to fail. When an aerial lift is operating under load, a rapidly deflating tire can cause the machine to overbalance and turn over.

Hydraulic hoses should be inspected for damage, leaks, kinking, or exposure to abrasion. Repair or replace any hoses that appear to be in danger of failing.

Fire extinguisher should be mounted in an easily accessible location.
Check the oil and coolant levels in the lift's engine.
Make sure all access panels are secured.
Check your work area for unlevel or unstable ground, and look at the swing radius of the machine to make sure it doesn't hit adjacent structures when the machine is rotated.

, This enables the lift engine to be cranked from the platform, and engages the platform control panel for controlling the lift's operation.

,, Adjust the suspension webbing so it fits properly, and check the condition of the lanyard.

,, There are several different electrical switches and joysticks that control the lift's operation, and each should be clearly labeled, including the direction of motion they control.

, Note that on the console there is also an instrument cluster which should give at least the following basic information:


A tilt or out of level warning indicator
A capacity meter. As the boom is extended, the amount of capacity normally changes on each machine. Booming out at a low angle reduces the machines capacity by as much as one half.
Fuel gauge

, This is usually indicated by a cranking engine symbol. If the engine doesn't turn over when the switch is pushed, you may have to recheck the ground control console kill switch or the master key to make sure they are in the correct position. Refer to the operator's manual if you cannot get the machine to crank easily.

,, This is the control engage lever, and is operated by placing your foot in the boot-like cover and pressing down the switch with the toe of your boot to enable to machine's controls. The engine should rev up when the switch is functioning properly, and most machines are equipped with an alarm that sounds when it is operated to warn bystanders the machine is moving.

, Go slowly to start with, it takes time to get used to the motion of the boom. For lifts equipped with a speed control dial feature, dial or select slow speed until you are comfortable operating the machine. Most aerial lift booms are raised by pushing the left toggle or joystick forward, and the force you apply is proportional to the speed the boom operates. Newer lifts have a safety device built into both joysticks (boom control and drive/steer) that requires you to lift a ring underneath the knob on the joystick to allow the device to engage. This prevents the platform from moving unexpectedly if the control is bumped while you are working.

, This is done by toggling the joystick in the direction you want the boom to swing (left or right, or clockwise/counterclockwise). Watch for obstructions any time you swing the boom.

, Note that smaller, compact aerial lifts may not have telescoping segments in their boom.

, Practice using each of the lift's functions in a clear, level area before maneuvering it near a structure you intend to work on with it.

, You should lower the work platform to about three feet above the ground, with the boom telescoped in to its shortest length, and position the platform at a slight angle from the centerline of the drive wheels to allow you to see in front of the machine while it is moving. Again, it is urgent you practice in a level, clear area before maneuvering around structures or obstacles.

, Most joysticks have steering buttons on top, so to turn your wheels to the right, toggle the right button (reversed if you are backing the machine), to turn left, toggle the left button. Push forward on the joystick to drive the machine forward, and pull the joystick back to back the machine. Again, note that the further you push or pull the joystick, the faster the machine will travel, so push and pull the joystick gently until you become familiar with the motion of the machine.

, Patience is critical in operating an aerial lift, and mistakes can be deadly or very costly. Read the warnings below, and remember, check out the operator's manual for detailed information about the particular lift you are using.

Consider how you would like your patio to look.,
Use paving and walling products to create many possibilities for laying out an attractive feature patio or a paved area.

,
Be prepared to give it a go yourself.,
Prepare.,
If a patio is to be on raised ground or to be on more than one level, mark the intended location of walling and steps.

,
Consider the color scheme of the paving.,
Work out electrical and drainage needs.,
Lay slabs so as to create patterns.,
Once you have made your plans, transfer them into a full size layout on the actual site.,
Be aware of the two essential rules that must be followed if a patio is being laid alongside a house wall:


The top of the paving slabs must be at least 150mm/5.9 inches below the house damp proof course.,
Get the right tools.,
Budget.,
Add mortar plasticizer (240-669) to mortar mixes for wall construction.,
Unless you are building onto existing concrete or firm paving stones, you must provide adequate foundations for the wall.,
Dig a trench.,
Continue laying the first course with 9mm/0.35 inches mortar joints between each block.,
To cut a block, chip a groove all round the block with a bolster chisel and club hammer along the intended cutting line.,
On a wall with a corner (return), start the second course with one block laid at 90° to the first course.,
Note that some types of slab - especially the thinner and more fragile ones - must only be laid on a solid bed of mortar 25mm thick with mortar filled joints of 8 - 10mm/0.31 - 0.39 inches (using the 'dob & dab' or other method, could cause some to break in use).

,
If your slabs are suitable (strong enough), the ground is firm, even when wet (for example as on chalk) and you only intend to lay slabs, you need do no more than remove any turf and a little topsoil.,
In a situation where the subsoil is less stable, such as with clay or peat, you need to dig much deeper in order to put in a stabilizing 100mm/3.93 inch thick layer of very well compacted hardcore before laying the sand bed.,
Prepare in advance.,
After preparing the base the paving can be laid onto the semi dry cement / sand mix mentioned previously.,
Depending on the type of ground, as shown previously, dig out enough to ensure that the area is deep enough to cope with the desired thickness of hardcore (it's always better to have too much than too little), 25mm/0.98 inches of mortar plus the slab thickness, leaving the top of the slabs just below turf level.

,
Before laying any slabs, lay and level a 25mm/0.98 inch layer of mortar onto the compacted hardcore (but only as much as can be laid in one go) remembering the mortar will set faster in warm weather.,
To ensure that an even slope is maintained, use 6mm/0.23 inch thick pieces of ply or some similar material.,
Ensure that all the slabs are well bedded down onto the cement/sand and do not pivot on an uneven base.,
If slabs need to be cut by hand, mark a pencil line all round.,
Do not walk on the set slabs for at least 24 hours.,
On sloping sites, or where patios have been built on two or more levels, you may well need to construct steps.,
If there is to be more than one change in level, i.e., two or three steps up, the second riser blocks will be bedded onto the paving slab surface at the rear.,
Ensure that you have planning permission.,
Choose one of three options when installing replacement or new driveways in the front garden area.,
Construct an attractive, long lasting, and hard wearing driveway using Stamford paving blocks measuring 100 x 200 x 50mm/3.9 x 7.8 x 1.9 inches.,
Choose patterns according to use.,
Make a striking off board.,
If constructing a driveway, set the blocks on sand and hardcore so you will need to dig out ground to a depth of about 200mm/7.8 inches.,
When the concrete has set, infill with hardcore and compact to a depth of about 100mm/3.9 inches using your striking-off board to check this.,
Starting at one end of the drive, lay sand across the full width but only extend about 3 metres/9.8 feet along the drive, or over an area you can reasonably expect to complete in a working period.,
Once you have laid the blocks over the first 1.5 metres/4.9 feet of the drive - not the complete sanded area - use the plate vibrator to bed them down into the sand.,
Consider pavers that don't require planning permission.,
Realize the problems that can occur.,
Drill a hole in the centre of the block, or largest piece, using a hammer drill and masonry bit.,
If the above method does not work, or the block is too tight, use a large masonry bit, and drill as many holes as possible across the block.,
Growing trees roots are usually the cause of raised block pavers and slabs.,
Remove any mortar (if used) from around the slab by using a narrow bladed masonry chisel (if the mortar is in poor condition, an old strong screwdriver may do).,
Be aware that sunken whole slabs are a little more difficult.,
Remove any old mortar from the hole and the edges.,
Add five blobs one to each corner and one to the centre (the slab will need to be raised just enough above the others to allow tamping down and levelling), apply a thin strip of mortar around the edges of the hole.,
Carefully place one end of the slab into position, making sure the surrounding gaps are equal, then lower.,
Cut the cord or banding level with the slab and push down below the surface (plastic banding is sharp so be careful).",How to Create a Patio," A patio doesn't have to be flat. You can combine paving slabs with walling, steps, plants and different materials to build your unique space. You can consider a layered patio if this makes it easier to use the space available, with a step or more down to each level.


When working out the design, measure the space first and take into account existing obstacles. How will you use the space available and what will you do about any obstacles?
Turn obstacles into features. For example, is there a small native tree you'd like to incorporate rather than knock down? This could be the start of the entire design, as you work around the tree, making the paving go around it and turning it into a focal point rather than seeing it as a nuisance.
Plants can be a part of the patio or can be added later. If they are to be a part, this means consideration of including soil as part of the patio's design. If added after, use containers to create an additional sense of design.;
,, Actually laying paving slabs and building walls for the garden are not difficult jobs. You do not need to be a professional to do this sort of work.

, Most people have an idea of how they want their garden to look but perhaps find it difficult to actually put their ideas into action. The secret is in planning in advance.


Start with a sheet of graph paper. Using the measurements you've already taken, draw to scale the part of the garden you wish to develop.
Mark in any immovable objects, such as the rear wall of the house, the garage, your boundary line. Include any items such as large trees and any other features you wish to keep.

,, Add interest to a layout by mixing slab colours, or you could leave out the odd slab here and there, to allow plants or shrubs to be grown.


Consider laying decorative chippings or gravel in the spaces.
Maybe incorporate a water feature or pond into a patio design. Important: If children are to use the area, make sure any water feature has little or no depth; ensure that water cannot pool but drains away quickly.

, Plan any lighting positions, electrical and drainage services early on (for drainage, see the relevant building regulations or talk to a plumber/architect). All cabling and drain runs will need to be in position, underground and protected before starting.


Note: All electrical work must conform to the relevant standard in your country (such as BS 7671 in the UK, the current IEE Wiring Regulations, and Part P of Building Regulations). You are advised to check with your local authority's Building Control Department, or an Authorised Competent Person before starting. If in any doubt about electrical work, contact a qualified electrician.

, The slabs don't always have to be alongside each other - they can be laid as stepping stones across the lawn or as a path beside a border. All ideas like these should be drawn into your scale plan - on paper - before commencing work.


As well as printing out the ideas, purchase a few test pavers to try out patterns for real. This can sometimes really transform your ideas about the exact layout because you'll also be seeing and feeling the texture, real color and depth.

, Set out using string lines and pegs. This will give you the opportunity to check that everything will be as you want it, and that, for example, not too much space is taken up by over-ambitious planning. Essential information at the planning stage is the size of paving slabs you intend to use, so that these can be incorporated into the design. Wherever possible, plan to use full size slabs to keep cutting to a minimum.


Note that the same applies to perimeter walling. You need to know block lengths and widths to be able to put these on the plans reasonably accurately (remembering the mortar gaps). Given accurate plans, you will be able to work out your material requirements more easily.

,
The slabs must be laid with a gentle slope away from the wall to ensure that rainwater runs away from the house. A slope of 50mm/1.9 inches over 3 metres/9.8 feet is the minimum acceptable.

, If the cutting of many paving slabs and walling blocks is necessary, you may find it worthwhile to hire a slab and walling block splitter from a local hire shop, or use a 9 inch/23cm angle grinder. If little cutting is needed, you will be able to make do with a club hammer and bolster chisel.


If hardcore needs to be put below paving on soft ground, this must be well compacted. Hire a plate compactor for this.
You will also need a good spirit level, ideally 600mm/23.6 inches long.

, It is always a good idea to know roughly the cost of materials required (in metric measurements, you can change these using Google's Metric Converter). Here is an example shopping list for a 3.6 by 2.7m patio using 450mm square textured paving slabs, plus a 3.6m long by about 760mm high wall, in pitched face walling blocks. Use the list to calculate your own requirements:


As a guide to quantities you require: 5 x 450 x 450mm paving slabs per square metre. 47 x 300 x 100 x 65mm walling blocks per square metre including mortar thickness.
One bag of sand and cement will be sufficient to lay about 30, 300 x 100 x 65mm walling blocks. You will require two bags of cement and 13 bags of sharp sand for every 5 square metres of paving.
Note: Always add 5-10% to quantities to allow for any breakage.

, This will improve adhesion, strength and workability. There are three stages:


Constructing a wall
Preparing the ground for a patio
Laying paving.

, The concrete part of these foundations should be 300mm/11.8 inches wide and 75mm/2.95 inches thick. The blocks will eventually be laid in the centre of the concrete surface.

, At least 100mm/3.93 inches of well firmed hardcore will be needed under the concrete so dig out a trench 180-200mm/7-7.8 inches deep where the wall is to be.


Use pegs and string to mark out the trench. Drive 300mm/11.8 inch long wooden pegs into the centre of the trench at 1200mm/47.2 inch to 1800mm/70.8 inch intervals so that they project from the base up to a point about 25mm/0.9 inches below ground level.
Use a spirit level and straight edge to ensure the tops of the pegs are level. They will serve as a guide when the concrete is laid, indicating the surface level.
Infill the trench with well compacted hardcore then concrete up to peg level. Leave the concrete to set.
Note: Cover with polythene sheeting to keep any rain off, and also to prevent it drying out too quickly in hot weather. Stretch a string line along the set concrete where the front edge of the wall is to finish. This will ensure that the first course is laid straight. The blocks are always laid in the centre of the concrete. Starting at one end of the wall spread mortar to a depth of about 12mm/0.47 inches behind the string line. The mortar should be workable but not sloppy. Lay the first end or corner block in place and tap down gently, compressing the mortar to about 9mm/0.35 inches. Check that it is level.

, Take care not to allow mortar to get on the faces of the blocks where it could cause staining.


Note: On a straight wall with no return corners start the second course with a half block.

, Lay the scored block on a sand bed, place the chisel in the groove then strike firmly with the club hammer to split the block. Alternatively, use a hired splitter or angle grinder (especially if you have many cuts to make)., Continue building course by course constantly checking that the blocks are level and in line both vertically and horizontally keeping the mortar joints to an even 9mm/0.35 inches thickness.


NOTE: Remove excess mortar immediately so that it does not stain the face of the blocks. When the mortar starts to set, either smooth it flush with the blocks using the rounded end of a piece of wood or rake, or back behind the block face to a depth of about 6mm/0.23 inches using a trowel. This is a job that can generally be left for a while, depending on temperature, after the mortar has been laid. Cap the finished wall with coping stones laid on a mortar bed.
The soil under the paving is retained by concrete blocks laid on hardcore and concrete footings. The footings for the two walls are separate to allow drainage through to the ground

,, You only need to dig out enough to ensure that the area is deep enough to cope with 38-50mm/1.4-1.9 inches of sand, plus the slab thickness, leaving the top of the slabs just below turf level. You can then mow over the edge of the slabs.

, In both of these situations the sand should be thoroughly mixed with cement - 1 part cement to 9 parts sand - and dampened with water creating a 'semi-dry' mix. The cement/sand is only laid just prior to the slabs going down.


In the case of thinner slabs, this should always be at least 100mm/3.93 inches of well-compacted hardcore, then lay the slab onto 25mm of mortar.
In reality, few areas are level enough for immediate paving, some areas will need to be excavated, while others built up to create the level.
Never re-use clay or peat soils to make up ground (as they will settle). Always make up with well compacted hardcore.

, Time spent in good preparation is time well spent. If you don't take care to prepare a firm base, you cannot expect your paving slabs to remain level or whole. Poor preparation will lead to slabs sinking and/or breaking, so that they have to be re-laid or replaced after a year or so., This should be 38-50mm/1.4-1.9 inches thick. As with the tiling of walls, always ensure that the first row (of slabs) is laid in a perfectly straight line, which may well be alongside the house wall or a wall, which you have built around the patio perimeter.

,, Working away from walls etc. and leaving a gap of between 8-10mm/0.31 - 0.39 inches for mortar joints, carefully lay the slabs.


All thin or fragile slabs must be laid on a full bed of mortar, 25mm/0.98 inches thick.
Remember: If slabs are to be butted up against the house wall, the top surface of the slabs must be at least 150mm/5.9 inches below d.p.c. level and the slabs must slope away from the wall.

, Place the ply on the edge of the slab furthest from the house wall.


Place the spirit level on the ply and on the opposite edge of the slab. When the bubble in the level is central, you have the correct slope.
Leave 9mm/0.35 inch gaps between slabs. It will help if you prepare a good supply of spacers for this purpose, perhaps cutting up pieces of plywood of the correct thickness.

, When necessary add or remove the bedding mix to achieve a firm and stable base. There can be some colour/shade variation between packs of slabs. Intermix slabs from different packs.

, Lay the slab on a bed of sand and chip out a groove along the line, using a club hammer and bolster chisel. Chop out to a depth of about 3mm all round the slab. Tap the waste part of the slab with the club hammer handle. The slab should break apart along the line if the cut groove is deep enough. As mentioned previously, if a lot of cutting has to be done, it is far better to hire a block splitter (if you can't get one, use a 230mm/9"" angle grinder).

, After this time you can remove the spacers. Infill the gaps with a mortar mix, taking care to keep the mix off the face of the slabs. This can be a tedious job, but failure to do it will lead to the growth of weeds between the slabs and will allow them to move sideways, out of position.


If time is not on your side, or you are not keen on filling each gap individually, use patio grout to fill paving gaps of over 5mm wide and 25mm deep.
Paving slabs are made from materials that contain natural salts. When wet these salts may appear on the surface of the slabs as discolouration or crystals - known as 'efflorescence'. This is perfectly normal. Never try to clean the surface of the slabs using yet more water. This will simply lead to the appearance of more crystals. Allow the slabs to dry then brush the surface firmly with a completely dry, stiff yard broom. Over a period of time after wetting, drying and brushing, the salts will cease to appear.

, This is a reasonably straightforward task involving little more than setting walling blocks onto concrete footings at the bottom end if at ground level and then putting paving slabs onto the walling following normal paving laying procedures. The paving slabs create the treads, and the walling blocks the risers.

, The slabs therefore must be secure and laid on hardcore topped with a cement/sand mix. In this case, the mix should be about 1 part cement to 6 parts sand and laid only slightly moistened.

, Note that in the UK, from October 2008, the permitted development rights that allow householders to pave over their front garden for hard standing without planning permission have changed. Planning permission is now required to lay traditional impermeable driveways that allow uncontrolled runoff of rainwater from front gardens onto roads. Other jurisdictions will likely have relevant rules in relation to the area you're in; check first.

, The right option for you will depend on local ground conditions and Local Authority guidelines. It is recommended that your contact your Local Authority Planning Department and seek advice before commencing work:


Use a traditional impermeable driveway solution and gain planning permission from your local authority.
Use a traditional impermeable driveway solution, with provision to ensure that surface water is directed to a soak away area within your property boundary.
Use a permeable solution such as for products that do not require planning permission.

, These blocks can be handled and laid more easily than most other driveway surfacing materials and can withstand the pressures exerted by the weight of a car when set on the correct base. They are equally suitable for making paths around the house and garden, and can even be used for a patio.

, Use a herringbone pattern for vehicular access. For pedestrian access or patios, either pattern is suitable. Coverage is about 50 blocks per square metre. Sharp sand is used for the bedding of the blocks and Patio and Block Paving Sand as the material for the infilling between blocks which have in-built spacers. The tools you will require are a shovel and rake, a plate vibrator (hired), a stone splitter (also hired), and a bolster chisel and club hammer.

, This is simply a piece of timber about 100mm/3.9 inches wide, and long enough to span the width of the intended drive or path. With other timber strips added at each end it is used to check the level of any hardcore used and then, with the end strips positioned differently, to level off the bedding sand. The timber strips are intended to rest on the top edges of a retaining edge structure whilst levelling is carried out. Any driveway or path needs to be built within a retaining frame to prevent the bedding sand or the blocks being displaced. Our path edgings set in a concrete bed are ideal for the purpose being set.

, Set the retaining edging stones in concrete so that the tops are at your intended finished drive level.

, Note the position of the timber strips. A plate vibrator may be used to compact the hardcore, but be careful not to disturb the edging stones.

,


Spread the sand to a thickness of 65mm/2.5 inches without walking on it or otherwise compacting.
Use the striking-off board, with the timbers set to achieve the level. Still without walking on the sand start positioning the blocks in the design of your choice on the sand up against the starting point. The in-built spacers, on the blocks, will keep them the correct distance apart.
If working to a herringbone pattern, don't worry about cutting blocks to fit edges yet. There can be some colour/shade variation between packs of blocks or slabs. Therefore, you should intermix blocks (or slabs) from different packs.

, Two or three passes with the vibrator should bed them to the level of the retaining wall. Do not vibrate within one metre of the end of the sand bed.


Continue spreading sand, laying blocks, and vibrating down in easy stages.
Fit cut edge blocks as necessary. Cut them with a splitter, if you have hired one, or with a bolster chisel and club hammer as for normal paving slabs, as previously described in this leaflet.
Patio/Block Paving Sand must then be spread over the surface and initially brushed backwards and forwards until the spaces between the blocks are completely full.
Leaving some sand on the surface, make a couple of passes with the vibrator to compress more sand into the gaps.
Finally, remove excess sand and the drive is ready for use.

, Pavers that are open and allow grass growth are ideal for occasional extra parking offering a versatile, sustainable alternative to solid paving. This is an open grid pattern allows grass to grow through for a 'lawn look' that can be mowed and maintained to disguise the concrete grid. These pavers should be 150mm MOT Type 1, hardcore, a bedding regulating layer of sharp sand or pea shingle 25mm plus 20% humus to support root development.

, Paving blocks can break or sink. Replacing or raising them can be a problem, as they are usually tightly packed together. Depending how tightly packed they are, one of two methods for their removal can be used (always wear eye protection and gloves):

, Insert a raw plug and screwed eye bolt of a suitable size, thread a piece of strong cord through the eye and carefully pull upward (this method only works if the block is not too tight).


Note: If there are several sunken blocks to be raised or replaced, start at the outer edge of the depression, these will be the least tightly packed and the easiest to remove.

, Using a sharp cold chisel and club hammer, chip out the block by cutting across the drilled holes. Repeat if necessary until the block is removed. Once a block (or piece) is out, the adjacent blocks should be easily removed.

Replacing one block - add a little sharp sand, levelling with the edge of a short piece of wood. Carefully drop the new block into place. Protecting the surface with another piece of wood; tamp down until level with the other blocks.
Replacing several blocks is similar to one, but make sure each one is completely level and firmly butted against its neighbour, making sure there aren't any gaps, or the last one won't fit and you'll have to start again. Fit the last one end up so it can be easily removed (this will stop the space closing up). When all are in place, use a long straight edge across the tops to re-check they are level, tamp down any that are proud. Add sand under any that are low. Fit the last block correctly (if this needs assistance, use a piece of wood over the block and gently tap in) and check for level.







, If this is the case, before attempting a repair, contact your local council/municipality (in the event of very obvious or serious damage, your insurance company), for advice about damage caused by trees. Never remove large roots without professional advice, you could cause all sorts of problems!

, Take care not to damage the edge of the neighbouring slabs. For a broken slab, chisel a hole into the broken part of the slab, then carefully lever out the pieces until all are removed.

, Assuming there is a gap between the slab and the neighbouring slabs, insert a wide chisel, spade or suitable lever.


Place a piece of wood over the adjacent slab and lever onto that.
Have two or three pieces of wood ready, strong and thick enough to support and raise the slab sufficiently for you to get your fingers underneath.
Carefully lift out the slab (if it's heavy, get some help). Place onto more pieces of wood (you'll need to get your fingers underneath to put it back).

, Add sharp sand, tamp down and level. If using mortar, allow about 10mm room on top of the sand for the mortar.

, The difficult bit is getting the slab into the hole without ruining the sand and mortar base.

, If you need to centre the slab, use a wide chisel or a spade and gently lever against (without damaging) the sound neighbouring slabs.


Another method is to lift the slab on two pieces of suitable cord (or flat plastic banding) and gently lower into the hole (if it's heavy use two or more people). Use the handle of a club hammer to tamp the slab into position, making sure it's level by using a long spirit level.

, Add mortar into the joints and smooth level with the other slabs. Quickly remove the excess or it will stain the slab surface and look unsightly.

Clear a fence line around the rubbish.,
Measure the perimeter of the pile and calculate the length so you can estimate how much material you will need for the fence.,
Buy the fencing material and suitable posts, as well as a gate (if you don't build your own), and fasteners.,
Start at one side of the location where you plan to put your gate.,
Set the next post in line with the first, keeping an equal distance from the edge of the rubbish pile, and about 8 feet from the starting point.,
Continue setting posts equally spaced around the pile until you are near your starting point.,
Roll out the fence wire (if using) around the perimeter you have created with the posts, then attach one end to the first gate post.,
Nail rail boards (typically treated 2X4s) if you are using wood privacy fencing, one at the top of the post, one in the middle, and one about a foot from the ground between your posts.,
Add material to block the view of the rubbish pile if you need to.,
Hang your gate and install a latch on it, and your job is complete.

",How to Build a Fence Around a Rubbish Area," Push any rubbish or undesirable material toward the pile, and move other material, brush, and obstacles away from the pile to be dealt with later.;
,  You have three common choices for fence material, along with several more exotic ones, depending on your budget and needs. Here are examples:


Chain link fencing. This is a durable material that will prevent rubbish from scattering, and is effective at keep larger animals like dogs, bears, coyotes, and others out of the pile. There are also vinyl strips that can be woven into the fabric to limit the view.
Wood privacy type fencing. This is not quite as durable as chain link, and generally is more expensive and requires more labor, but it does create an attractive fence and will keep most animals out of the rubbish.
Welded wire fabric fencing. This material is made with wires, welded together in a grid, for example, 2inch by 4inch, then galvanized. It is inexpensive but not very durable, and is less effective at keeping animals out, especially smaller rodents.
Panel fencing, Rohn type fence, and even corrugated metal roof panels can also be used, each having their own advantages and disadvantages.

, Use the distance around the rubbish pile allowing for a buffer (clear area immediately inside the fence) to estimate the number of posts and the amount of fencing you will need. Since the fence run may not be straight from corner to corner ( it is very likely you may choose to circle the pile, depending on its shape), it may be difficult to get an exact length for the finished fence.

, Use a stout post here, since you may be stretching/pulling chainlink/wire mesh from it, and it will also have a gate hanging from it.  Dig your post hole to a suitable depth (30 inches is common, depending on how firm your ground is), set the post in the hole, and fill in around it, packing the dirt as you do so.

,  This distance may be shorter if the pile is small and you follow the circumference of it, so adjust as needed.

, About three or four posts from your gate, you will want to measure the distance so you have fairly equal spacing and the final post hits where it should for the gate to fit. Finish installing and packing your posts, and you will be ready to install the fencing material.

, Lift sections of wire up to each post, pulling it tight and attaching it as you go, until you reach the opposite gate post. Since we haven't specified what type post you are using, you will either be nailing the wire with fence staples or tying it with wires, but either way, make sure it is securely fastened.

, Now, nail fence boards to these, standing upright, and continuing around the rubbish pile.

,  Privacy fence will not require anything, but chainlink or wire fabric may require you add material, either vinyl slats or a plastic mesh fabric made for this purpose to hide the rubbish pile.

",How to Build a Fence,"


Posts are the vertical support beams that are embedded in the ground.
Rails are the horizontal supports that are attached to the posts.
Boards or slats are the main material of the fence and can be either horizontal or vertical: they are attached to both the posts and rails.;
,


If it is to provide privacy to a backyard garden, tall wooden boards may be the most appropriate choice.
If it is meant to contain a pet, a simple stretch of pickets may provide the best combination of fresh air and ample protection.

, Privacy fences should be a minimum of six feet to keep out prying eyes, while barriers meant to contain most pets or livestock can usually stay around four.

, Set end posts at the corners and use them to run a line in the exact area the fence is to be constructed. , This should generally be around six to eight feet apart, depending on the type of fence and the terrain it will be installed upon. , Take the time to carefully evaluate their position, as failing to align posts properly will impact the solidity of the overall structure.

, To ensure a stable fence, plan to set your posts at a depth of 1/3 of their length. This is the depth you'll need to dig your holes.

, Allow to stand overnight so the wood can become saturated. , Rock gently to help settle it. , Corner posts should get extra support in both directions. , Leave the braces where they are for at least two weeks to allow the post to settle into place. ,, Measure a set distance from the top of each post to determine where the place the bottom rail in order to keep it straight. , Depending on the fence style, there may be just one or several.

, These can be all on one side of the rails or alternated in a pattern. , Most gates are at least 40 inches (101.6 cm) in length. , Use the gravel/rocking/tamping process mentioned earlier to make them as sturdy as possible.

,,,, If everything looks ship-shape, brace the hanging post with extra brackets to make sure it can bear the weight.

,


Whether you want the gate to open in or out determines which side you hang it on.
Once the hinges are solidly placed, install the handle and latch on opposite side.

Use household products to repel deer.",How to Build a Deer Fence," Deer can cause serious damage in a garden, not all of it reparable. They’ll strip bark from trees as well as eat plants and foliage.


Deer also have a tendency to attack in groups, increasing the amount of damage to your garden. As they tend to visit overnight, it’s hard to be vigilant against them all the time.






A permanent barrier, such as a deer fence, is the best strategy against deer attack in the long run.





;
, Deer tend to browse between dusk and dawn so it isn't always possible to see what’s causing damage in the garden. However, deer often leave a few telltale signs behind them.


If you find that damage has occurred overnight, particularly to shoots, flower buds, and foliage, then it may be deer causing it.






You may also see tree bark that’s been eaten or damaged by deer rubbing their antlers against it.







, Depending on the variety of deer you have in your garden, your fence needs to be high enough that deer can’t jump over it. A height of 7 feet (2.1 m) should repel most types of deer.


Deer will also lift wire and squeeze under fences so the fence needs to fit close against the ground to prevent the deer from getting in underneath it.







, Deer are good at squeezing between wires or fence posts so a mesh fence is better suited than one made of wire or barbed wire strands.


The maximum mesh size should be 8 x 6 in for most deer. However, if you are trying to keep out small muntjac deer you will need a maximum mesh size of 3 x 3 in.






Solid wood panel fencing also works well against deer, as the animals can’t see what is beyond the fence and will avoid jumping over it for fear there may be danger.







, Electric fences don't tend to work effectively as a deterrent against deer. Hedges won’t do much good either as deer can push through them – or they’ll eat the hedge!

, Some gardeners choose to use a temporary barrier against deer just when their plants are at their most vulnerable. This fence can easily be taken down once the threat to the plants has passed.

Drive some temporary stakes (some people use electrical conduit pipes) deeply into the ground no more than 6–7 feet (1.8–2.1 m) apart and wrap or tie your temporary fencing material to it.






Some gardeners use fishing wire at a minimum spacing of 10cm between rows, or bird netting. This means there is little or no visual barrier which is nice for humans but will also mean deer can see your plants, which may mean the fence is less effective.
Temporary fences tend to be flimsy so you may have less success with this approach in windy conditions. Check your fence regularly to make sure it isn’t damaged.

, You are likely to have more success with a sturdy, permanent barrier against deer, particularly if deer eating your plants is a continuous problem. However, it’s always advisable to consult with neighbors before erecting a high permanent fence.

, Clip back any branches and remove any plants that will be in the way before you begin, lest you tread on them while erecting the fence.


Start by marking out where the fence will go using rods or canes and some string or chalk.






You’ll need to calculate how wide your fence panels are plus the width of your posts to determine where to dig holes for your fence posts.







, One way of securing the fence posts is to drive metal fence post boxes straight into the ground. However, in stony ground you’ll probably find it hard to drive these in straight.


As a result, you may prefer to dig a hole for the post first, then secure the post with concrete or fencing mix such as Postcrete. The hole needs to be about 3 times as wide as the post and half as deep as the post is tall (usually around 3.5 feet deep.)






You may like to put about 6 inches of gravel at the base of the hole for drainage, and consider pre-soaking wooden fence posts overnight in wood preserver to extend their life.







, If you decide to go down the concrete route, first insert your fence pole and check it using a spirit level to ensure it is straight. Remember to use temporary support posts to hold it in place while the concrete hardens.


Attach the panels of the fence before concreting. You’ll find fencing clips make a neater job than driving nails in.






To concrete, you’ll probably find it easiest to use a fencing post mix that is mixed up in the hole. It's important to read the instructions, but generally you just need to fill the hole with water most of the way up, then add the powder and stir it up with a stick.







, In areas where there are many deer, you may find it helpful to have a second row of fencing several feet outside the main fence. This is because deer perceive depth poorly and double fencing seems to disorient them.

, Tying ribbons or streamers to the fence may help the deer to perceive the barrier and realize how tall it is. This may prevent damage to the fence as the deer will avoid trying to penetrate it.


You may also find digging a ditch outside the fence will also help its effectiveness against deer.






Ideally, a deer fence should be angled away from the garden at about 30-45 degrees to the ground, however this is quite hard to achieve.







, However, as a general rule they will avoid eating thorny plants or ones with fuzzy or leathery leaves.

, If your deer aren’t very regular visitors, or are new to your garden, you can deter them using chemical deer repellents.

These products are based on strong smells or bad tastes such the brand ‘Deeroff’ which smells like rotten eggs and garlic and performs well in tests.






The manufacturers recommend re-applying the repellent every quarter year.







, Deer can also be deterred by electronic devices which emit noises they dislike. Unfortunately, the deer can get used to the sound over time, so these devices will gradually become less effective.


Deer will also be scared off by the presence of dogs, so consider stationing your dog in a kennel near your garden overnight.







, Trees can be protected against deer browsing for their bark by placing deer guards on their trunks. Most work by preventing the deer from getting close enough to the tree to damage it. Others encase the tree or shrub in a nylon case.

, Some gardeners will strongly recommend using grated Ivory or Irish Spring soap to repel the deer. It’s best to put the soap into little mesh or hessian bags and hang from the trees and shrubs.


Other people have had success by beating an egg with about 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of water and spraying this on bushes in the garden.






Remember you’ll need to reapply this regularly, especially if it rains.

Raise the height of the fulcrum once the end of the plank touches the ground, and then try again.d then you can probably just pull it up with your hands.",How to Pull Up a T Post,";
, Make sure there is enough rope between the post and the plank to put the plank on top of the fulcrum.

, It works best if the plank is resting horizontally on top of the fulcrum, rather than vertically, but the length of your rope may require you to do it vertically.

, Be very careful while doing this; if one thing slips, you could injure yourself. Watch the fulcrum to make sure that it does not start to lean.

, This can also be dangerous; T posts are kind of heavy, and they have some sharp edges. Be careful, and be sure to pull straight up. If it doesn't want to move, wiggle it a little, then try again.

Relax and enjoy!",How to Downsize Your Home," Someday, you may take up exercising, but the treadmill/Stairmaster/Bowflex has been gathering dust for some time. Wouldn’t a good pair of walking/running shoes be more useful and take up significantly less space? Does anyone actually sit in the chair in the corner? How often do you eat at the table? When was the last time you used your stereo?
Deciding what you really need requires a good long look at how you live your life daily and prioritizing the activities and items that are already a part of your actual lifestyle--not those activities or items that you want to be part of your lifestyle, but haven't gotten around to yet.


Take a walk through your house or apartment and evaluate everything you come across (furniture, books, food, etc.). Ask yourself if you've used it in the past year and, if so, how often? Be honest with yourself. If you think you could live well without it, out the door it should go. Make a note of it.
Consider that most of the stuff people keep without using is a tribute to an unmet goal. The most common example is probably exercise machines that we always say we'll use, but don't. Then there are those books we intend to read, that table we eventually want to have dinners and brunches on, etc. We keep things around ""just in case"", or hoping that their presence will eventually encourage us to use them. But let's be realistic, if seeing that treadmill get a coating of dust hasn't inspired you yet, what makes you think it ever will? Make room for the things you'll actually use.
For stuff that you really have a hard time getting rid of, make this agreement with yourself: Put the items in storage. If you don't need or use them within 6 months, give, sell or throw them away.;
, Only put back the things you couldn't live well without. That means that if you use a whisk every other day it stays but the melon-baller when you don't even like melon... Out it goes. Put these items in boxes, crates or bags in a garage or other storage area

, You will need to know how your furniture will (or won’t) fit into your new space - particularly large items such as your sofa and your bed - so measure everything.
You will also need to get the room measurements of your new space. Ask if you can take measurements or if there is a floor plan available to you. Don’t forget about the location of doors and windows as this will be a factor in furniture placement.
Once you have these measurements, make a floor plan using your furniture’s measurements. Try using Better Homes and Gardens’ Arrange-A-Room online software to simplify the process (requires registration but is free). This will give you a much better idea on what you can keep and what will have to go.

, How many times have you moved into a new place only to realize - too late - that you have overestimated the amount of storage space? While you’re getting room measurements, make sure to properly assess the storage situation you’ll be inheriting. Will you have fewer kitchen cupboards? How many closets will you have? If you are moving into an apartment, does it have a storage locker and, if so, what are its dimensions?
Assessing exactly how much of the new space is dedicated to storage will give you and idea of the volume of items you need to dispose of before moving in. Don’t forget hidden storage areas you currently use in your old place. If you place a lot of items above the kitchen cabinets in your current home, for example, find out if the cupboards in the new place have storage in that area as well.

, Go through your storage areas first (attics, basements, closets, etc). You will be surprised to find out what you’ve put away instead of gotten rid of. If you’re like most of us, you will find boxes of items that haven’t seen the light of day for years and there’s a reason for this: you don’t need them. Get rid of them at once. Hesitation will only melt your resolve.


Don’t forget to go through your bathroom cabinets, kitchen and “junk” drawers. We have a tendency to accumulate unnecessary items in these places. Get rid of empty bottles, balls of twine, expired medicines and beauty products, and your collection of plastic margarine containers. Be brutal.
How you dispose of these unnecessary items will depend on how much energy and/or time you have. The easiest thing to do is to load them up on a truck and drop them off at the nearest thrift shop.
Join a Freecycle group to give stuff away (www.freecycle.org)
If you live in an apartment building or townhouse complex, notice boards and drop off areas for giving unwanted items to neighbours is sometimes provided.
Call up your friends and relatives and see what they need. You may be able to enlist their help in the move for a promised dresser/bed/armchair!

, If you’re in need of a pre-move windfall, try these:


For a large number of items, have a yard sale (or a series of yard sales), or if you have a lot to sell quickly, consider a service to take care of it for you (e.g., Google liquidation estate content sales).
If you have time before the move, utilize sites such as Craigslist and eBay to sell off the best stuff. You’ll likely get more money for your items this way but it is more time consuming.
Craigslist is a good avenue for selling larger items such as furniture, appliances and home décor items to people living in your area. If you have the means, offering delivery will often produce quicker sales.
eBay is a good venue for selling collectible items such as old albums, comic books, and figurines. Make sure to take good quality photos of the items and offer good descriptions. Remember that you are a salesperson. Sell those products!
Used designer clothing can be resold in consignment shops. These stores can be found in your local business directory. Be sure to shop around. Some stores offer better rates than others.

, Before you move into your new place, it’s a good time to work out some storage solutions for your stored items. You can do this as you pack. Place your storage items in decorative storage boxes that can be moved and placed in the new storage areas without much effort. Plastic bins are great for moving and storing, come in many sizes, are stackable, and the see-through ones make finding what you need a snap. The measurements taken of the new storage areas will ensure a good fit. Come moving day, these boxes will be much easier to deal with.


Label everything by room. Don’t think that you will remember big television box is actually full of pots and pans. You won’t.

, Move your furniture into your new home first. You will have the most energy for this task at the beginning of the move and it will also give you a better indication of where the smaller things will go. Do not merely fill a room with furniture with the idea of sorting it all out later. There is nothing worse than trying to navigate through small rooms littered with boxes and stacks of furniture after a day of moving.
Place furniture in the rooms as you go, according to the plan you made earlier. If you have done your homework correctly, your big items should fit in nicely and already give you a sense of home (and a place to sit while taking a break from all of your hard work!)

, Contained items that are meant for storage can be placed directly in their allotted spaces where they will be out of the way. By putting these things away as you move in, you’ll be saving yourself the stress of trying to maneuver through tiny, packed rooms during the next few days.

, Your labeled boxes can now be put into their respective rooms and the unpacking can begin. Begin with the bathroom, as that is the room most likely to be needed immediately. If you have only kept the basics, unpacking this room will be a breeze.

, Utilize closet and cupboard storage solutions as you unpack. This way, more can be stored in these tight spaces and you will be setting a precedent for how your new, smaller space will be used. Don’t fall back into lazy habits or your downsized place will get you down.

, You have now entered the realm of living small. You no longer have to worry about the financial burden or time draining tasks of maintaining a home too big for your needs and you have simplified your life by surrounding yourself with only those things that are most important to you. Rejoice!

Use guidebooks written for travelers. These are handy for new arrivals moving into a city as they are for tourists.;
, It's essential to understand the local city laws or have an idea of them when first arriving.


If you drive, you must be aware of all laws pertaining to driving, including how to handle emergency vehicles, snow emergencies and bans, and parking meter time limits. Also understand road markings, signs and simple but important things such as merging and giving way to vehicles in particular situations (for example, where there are cable cars involved).

, The further your move is, the more different of a climate and weather change you will need to expect. Moreover, large cities tend to create their own micro-climates and this can be disconcerting at first, until you learn to cope with additional heat from so much concrete, extra humidity, icy sidewalks or windy corridors caused by tall buildings and grid streets. Another thing that sometimes comes as a surprise is how cold shade thrown from tall buildings can make a street feel, especially in the mornings.


Jot down and learn the average temperatures for January and July. January is usually the coldest month of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and hottest in the Southern Hemisphere, while July is the complete opposite (hottest in the Northern Hemisphere and coldest in the Southern Hemisphere).
Plan on changing your wardrobe in order to adjust to your new location, depending on the seasons. Many places around the tropics do not experience the same seasons and weather patterns as those areas closer to the North and South polar regions.

, You might want to start with city hall, grocery stores, banks, the DMV/RMV (Department or Registry of Motor Vehicles), the closest school, police station, and gas station.

There are plenty of apps available to help you locate good eating establishments and places of entertainment, so download a reputable one to assist you.

, Many cities does not have the same environment as towns and counties. Accept the reality that you may not be able to do the same activities or see the same sights in the city.

Everything can take longer in a city, such as traveling from A to B, waiting for service, getting help from tradespersons, etc. Be prepared to wait!

, Purchase one with detailed information, such as street inserts and public transportation routes.


If you have a smartphone or similar portable electronic device, many maps can be easily downloaded, often for free. There are also many programs available that allow you to draw on digital maps, to make notes, etc.

, The most direct and fastest routes are typically the easiest to learn when moving into a new city.

After time and getting routes down, you can then determine if side streets or other highways are better or worse for you.

, From small playgrounds to the zoo, every city has locations that small towns and rural areas wouldn't or have a lack of.

, City life is usually more expensive than town and country prices. Even the smallest things can really add up. There are often things you'd get for free in smaller towns that cost money in the city, including parking, a glass of water/bread with your meal or certain kinds of household rates. You'll need to account for all these extras as part of your budgeting., Write out your list in two columns and then break each one down, if needed.


Food, gas, electricity, rent/mortgage, and heat may be the most essential needs to put down. Social activities, attractions, household items, and internet would probably be considered as wants.

, Research on the variety of electric, internet, and phone based companies in the area. Always calculate if bundle packages are cheaper than getting single items., Find a supermarket near your home and see if it offers free or cheap delivery or whether you'll need to self-deliver. For fresh food, scout farmers markets in the city. Many farmers markets have cheaper produce than supermarkets, however, depending on the city, they may also be seasonal and not always open.

, While attraction discounts would be more fit for families, any individual can enjoy discounts to restaurants, bars, and other new discoveries in the city. Look for discounts online (company websites, special offer sites, etc.) and through tourist brochures, etc. Use coupons when shopping for food., Allow yourself to naturally take everything around you in. Transferring into a bigger environment is only overwhelming if one believes it is.
, Use any downtime to get to know your neighbors, whether you are in an apartment, townhouse, or neighborhood. Not only will this help to decrease any feeling of loneliness, these people can be a source of support and help if you have problems. In return, be ready to help them too.

, Motivate yourself to sign up with events that will increase your social being and interactions with others in the city. Whether it is volunteering for a clean-up organization, donation drive, or sports, there's a long list of activities one can do.

, Each city has its own unique take when the sun goes down and the lights turn on. Even if you work in the middle of the city, it's truly a different approach between day and night. Ask the locals for tips and also ask them about where it's safe to go at night, just to be sure.

, Adjust your budget in allowing yourself to go out at least once a week and try out a new restaurant or drink that you have not tried before.


Many restaurants nowadays experiment with fusion cuisine, meaning combining two region cuisines together, such as Japanese and American.

, You may never know if you need extra pocket change for a last minute parking meter, take out drive-thru, public transportation, tolls, etc.
, Build ""mutual interests"" with people around your area on Twitter. A lot of companies, including police departments, local businesses, and city councils are interacting and networking with residents and fans nowadays. And use sites like Meet Up to connect with local people in your area who have interests similar to your own, such as cycling, overcoming anxiety, raising children, building computers, whatever!

Clean retrieved items thoroughly.",How to Dumpster Dive," Before you jump in headfirst, it will be worth knowing the legal risks you face for reclaiming waste items from public containers. In most places, trash is not considered private property, so it’s unlikely that you’ll be charged with theft. However, it’s possible for dumpster divers to be targeted for other offenses, such as invasion of privacy, trespassing or vagrancy.Dumpster diving is generally frowned upon in polite society, even in places where it’s technically legal.
If there are fences, locks or “No Trespassing” signs on the premises, consider yourself warned. It may be wise to stay away from locations under tight scrutiny.;
, As most people already know, you can typically find trash receptacles outside of major businesses, but you might also expand your hunting radius to include urban neighborhoods, schools, churches and public locations like parks and beaches. To avoid detection, look for dumpsters that aren’t in plain sight.Look up the trash pickup times in your city so you can have a chance to go through a promising receptacle before it’s emptied.Plan your runs for the early morning or evening hours when most people are occupied., Public trash disposal sites often contain a wealth of treasures just waiting to be claimed. Thrifty divers have been known to uncover designer clothing, valuable scrap materials and even expensive out-of-date electronics in the refuse of high-end establishments. Having a basic idea of what's out there and where you're likely to find it will help you focus your search.If you’re looking for a specific type of find, the smartest place to look is at the source. For example, you’ll have a much better chance stumbling upon unused beauty products behind a cosmetics boutique, or turning up small electronics at an office supply store.Keep an eye out for old, unwanted furniture and appliances near dumpsters in residential areas., Willing yourself to climb into a hot, smelly dumpster isn’t always easy since most people have an aversion to objects like garbage that they find disgusting. It can help to take a few moments to collect yourself before setting out. Remember why you’re doing what you’re doing, and keep in mind that playing a part in helping eliminate unnecessary waste.Dumpster diving can be messy work. It may not be the best pastime for the faint of heart or those with weak stomachs.

, There’s a good chance that whatever you wear is going to get dirty or torn, so wear older garments that you don’t mind ruining. Comfortable clothing will allow you to move around freely, which can be helpful should you have to do any climbing or other maneuvering. It’s also a good idea to pull on a pair of thick-soled, closed-toed shoes or boots to protect your feet from sharp exposed edges.Wear pants and tops with long sleeves to minimize your exposure to unsanitary messes.If you’re going to actually enter the dumpster, wear sturdy fabrics like denim, nylon or leather and keep as much of your body covered as possible.
Remove any accessories you don’t want to lose before you get inside.

, Feel free to bring along anything else that you think might come in handy, like a pair of thick gloves or a small stepping stool or milk crate to help you get up into the dumpster. Night dives should be accompanied by a flashlight or headlamp to make it easier to see. Don’t forget to also bring some kind of spacious container to stash your discoveries in.A durable canvas laundry bag can make a great way to transport your finds back home.
Use a long pole to poke around in the trash until something catches your attention. If you’re careful enough, there may be no need to get inside the receptacle at all.Flashlights may also be necessary during the daytime if the dumpster is especially deep or situated in the shade.

, While you may be tempted to bring back anything and everything of potential value from your dive, it’s best to limit your haul to the things you have a specific need for. Otherwise, useless items will just accumulate and eventually find their way into the trash again.Organize your finds into a few separate piles: things you can use, things other people might be able to use and things you can sell.If you don’t find anything worth keeping, cut your losses and move on to the next spot.

, As mentioned, dumpster diving is looked upon with notoriety. If you’re not paying attention, you may end up being surprised by random onlookers, business owners or even the police. Keep a watchful eye over your surroundings at all times, or have a friend or fellow dumpster diver on standby to signal you if someone approaches.Spend as little time in the area as you can. Get in, get the goods and get out.Be ready to abandon your hunt at a moment’s notice.

, If you’ve removed anything from the dumpster during your search, be sure to return it before you go on your way. While you’re at it, look around for other trash nearby that you can throw away. Try to leave the area as clean—or even cleaner—than you found it.Giving away your presence makes you more likely to be caught red-handed on future visits.
The goal is to economize, not to vandalize. Don’t give dumpster diving a bad name.

, If you set out with the goal of replenishing your pantry, it will be helpful to know where to go for salvageable food items that aren't an obvious health hazard. You can almost always find something of use behind restaurants and supermarkets. Cafes and bakeries are another dependable source, as they're required to dispose of freshly-prepared food items at the end of the day. Most of the time, these items won't have been left sitting long enough to have gone bad.A good general rule is to start your search at a place that sells the type of food you're looking for.
Dumpster diving at popular stores and restaurants is best left for the nighttime hours when you're less likely to be noticed., Things packaged in boxes, jars and wrappers tend to last longer than fresh foods because they receive less exposure to the bacteria in the air. These sorts of goods should always be your first choice when on the hunt for a meal. Look for items that are still in their airtight packaging, like canned tuna or individually wrapped granola bars.Avoid anything that's not sealed or has been previously opened.
Canned and dried goods (such as uncooked rice, oats and pasta) usually stay good for several months after their listed expiration date., A bag of soft avocados or a case of mayonnaise may still be safe to eat, but you should try to find something to do with them right away. The best way to make various edible discoveries stretch if they're nearing (or just past) their prime is to incorporate them into other foods. For instance, a bunch of brown bananas isn't particularly appetizing on its own, but it will go perfectly in a loaf of bread or a fruit smoothie.Cook as much of what you bring back as you can. This will kill off the harmful bacteria that begins to reproduce when food spoils and may also level out stale and unpleasant flavors.Most types of produce can be canned, pickled or turned into jams or jellies, effectively extending their lifespan.

, It should go without saying, but use your common sense—if you come across food that's noticeably rotten or has a foul odor, don't eat it. The majority of meats, dairy products, fruits and vegetables that find their way into the garbage fit into this category. Though they're enticing, perishables are invariably the first to go bad. You're better off setting your sights on foods that fare well in a wide range of storage conditions and using your best judgment.If you do decide to take it with you anyway, double-check it for signs of mold or tampering first, and be aware of the risk you're taking to your health.
Never consume frozen or refrigerated items after they've thawed to room temperature. This could make you extremely sick., You never know what might be lurking at the bottom of a dumpster or recycling bin. Broken glass, rotting food, hazardous materials and other types of waste all pose a potential threat to your health. Proceed slowly and cautiously while sifting through unidentified rubbish, especially if it’s hard to see what’s around you.Prop open the lid of the dumpster or have a friend hold it for you so you can work unimpeded., Trash receptacles are sometimes home to rats, opossums, raccoons and other scavengers. When startled or provoked, these animals may be motivated to attack. Give the inside of the dumpster a quick once-over before climbing inside to avoid a surprise encounter with a potentially dangerous pest. Banging the outside of the dumpster may also help scare off any unwanted company.


If the dumpster you're attempting to search is inhabited by critters, the safest option is to just move on to the next location.
Scavenger rodents are known for carrying diseases that can prove fatal to humans if contracted. Keep your distance at all costs.

, As soon as you get back home, hop in the shower to clean off any dirt and germs you may have encountered during your dive. Wash with hot water and an antibacterial soap, and don’t forget to shampoo. Pay special attention to areas that tend to get missed, like inside your ears and beneath your fingernails.Prolonged or unsafe exposure to garbage can lead to a host of health concerns.Contrary to popular belief, a solid personal hygiene regimen is very important for dumpster divers—arguably even more important than for normal people.

, Soak non-electronic finds with warm water and a strong disinfectant to kill bacteria and remove mold and other residue. Rinse salvageable foodstuffs like produce and packaged snacks with clean water, then store them properly or cook and use them immediately. After a good cleaning, most discoveries will be restored to top shape.Spot clean electronics with a washcloth and rubbing alcohol or mild liquid detergent.
Food items should receive special attention, as it can be extremely unsafe to eat anything that’s spoiled or contaminated."

Share the space and don't dictate.",How to Merge Two Households," Merging two households might seem like a relatively straightforward task, a question of fitting lives and possessions together in the same space like puzzle pieces. The process can actually get pretty intense, since it might require giving up some treasures. Adapting your lifestyle to fit with someone else's is a learning process that requires a lot of compromise. Before you start the merge, have a conversation with the person you're moving in with to go over all the big decisions and prevent things from getting too emotional or tense.


Talk about what vision you have for the new household. How will the new home look? Will each room have a combination of both of your possessions?
Talk about the possessions you both cherish. Is there something you assume your partner will give up? Is there something you really don't want to give up? Get it all out there right away.;
, Whether you're moving to a brand new home or someone else is moving into yours, you're probably going to need all the space you can get. Set aside time to pull everything out of your closets and storage areas, and all those nooks and crannies where you might be stashing stuff you don't use too often. Figure out what you need and what you don't, and make a plan to get rid of the possessions you don't need right away, so you can move on to the next step. Make three piles: ""keep,"" ""give away,"" and ""not sure."" You can go back to the ""not sure"" pile if you end up having more space than you thought you would.Take a look at your items and think about how often you use them. A good rule of thumb is to get rid of anything you haven't used in over a year.
Having a yard sale is a great way to get rid of unwanted possessions and make some money in the process. Make sure to list your yard sale on Craigslist so people know you're having it. Yard sales are most popular in the spring, summer and fall, when the weather's nice. What you don't sell, you can donate.
Remember it is much easier to get rid of things before you pack and move. Your merge will be easier if you make the decisions before you start squeezing in items that don't work.

, One of the most difficult parts of merging two households is deciding which possession to keep when you and the person you're moving in with both have something. Depending on how much space you have, you'll probably have to give away some large pieces of furniture as well as smaller items, like kitchen supplies. Who needs two toaster ovens? Sit down together and make a list of all the duplicates, the decide which items are in the best condition and worth keeping. Here are a few items that you might need to consider:


Furniture: beds, dressers, side tables, couches, kitchen tables, chairs, etc.
Appliances: blenders, toasters, washers, dryers, coffee makers, etc.
Kitchen supplies: can openers, wine openers, pots, pans, baking supplies, etc.
Extra linens: sheets, towels, etc.

, Get together with your partner and make a list of your ""must haves."" If some of your must haves are large items that will require a lot of space, have a conversation about where they will go and whether it really makes sense to keep them.Make sure your list isn’t three pages longer than your partner’s. You each get equal say when it comes to ""must haves."" This is an exercise in compromise.
Limit your must haves it to things you do actually need, then go back and see which “wants” will fit in the new space, too.

, Consider where you will store these, since you'll have less space in your merged household. You and your partner will both need a plan for where you will keep these things.


You may be used to free rein with closet space before the merge. Now you may need to rotate seasonal items and store some items that aren't used so everyone has space.
Consider boxing up or using vacuum compaction bags to store things you don't wear often.

Organize your files and records. Determine what is safe to shred if you have multiple years of financial records.
Get rid of or store any items you don't want to become common property. Since you're living together you can't expect the same privacy and the ability to keep certain items secret. If you've got anything embarrassing you should think twice before taking it.

, This might seem like a bit of a hassle, but it will make your life a lot easier when you start moving into the new place or when someone else is moving into yours. A floor plan is a drawing or illustrations of the floor space of each room in your house, as viewed from above. Your drawing doesn't have to be a work of art; just create a to-scale sketch of each room. Include doors, windows and radiators, if present so you know where furniture can be positioned. Measure the rooms in your new space. Write the measurements of the different rooms along the edges of the sketched walls. This way you can figure out what will fit where.Include the windows, doors, cabinets, the kitchen island, and other features that might affect how you arrange furniture in the room.
Take pictures as well, so you'll remember the little details that could help you decide where to put things.

, Before you even pack it up and start moving it, determine where you want each piece of furniture to be positioned. That way you can put it where it's supposed to go as soon as you move it into the house, rather than grouping everything in the front room and trying to figure out where it should go.


Measure the furniture to determine where it will fit. Check your drawing of the floor plan and visualize how each piece of furniture will look.
Keep swatches cut from the underneath of couches, chairs and upholstered pieces. It will be easier to tell if items match or not before having to move them.
Think about furniture pieces individually instead of their current arrangement.
Follow common decorating rules in terms to help you arrange things in a pleasing fashion. For example, couches should be surrounded by a little space on all sides. In the bedroom, your bed should be the main focus, rather than shoved in a corner., Whether you're moving together into a brand new space or into one of your existing homes, decide on a new decorating scheme that will tie all of your possessions together into a cohesive home. You might want to paint the walls, install new light fixtures, get new curtains, and so on in order to make the space feel like it belongs to the whole family, and not just one person.


See if it’s possible for each person in the house to get some space of his or her own.
Decide which rooms will be ""family rooms"" and aim to have them reflect the personalities of the entire household.
Consider getting furniture recovered. A good upholstery shop can not only change the fabric but they can add or remove padding to change the shape. You'll have a chance to pick fabrics together and there's a better chance of finding something that ties your taste together.

, Now it's finally time to get ready to move by putting your possessions in boxes. Go through your home room by room and box things up. Make sure fragile items are packed with soft materials to keep them safe during transit. If you're having movers help you merge your two households, make sure to give them clear directions about where everything should go.


Label the boxes by color, and have the person you're moving in with do the same. For example, items that belong in the living room could have a purple label, items for the kitchen could have a red label, and so on.
Have the boxes them delivered to the appropriate room in the new home.

, Realize that merging two households means making compromises. Your lifestyles are about to change, but that doesn't have to be a negative thing. In fact, it's very exciting. Help each other make the transition easier by respecting each other's ideas and talking everything out if you have a conflict.Don’t start things off on the wrong foot by being stubborn about little things that don’t matter. If you have three hand mixers, for example, have the mentality that you're willing to give yours up for the sake of the household.
Don’t fight about whether to keep heirlooms. If your partner really wants to keep the table his grandfather made, don't fight about it, even if you think the thing is hideous. If it's a family heirloom, it should stay in the family.

, The new household isn't going to be like your old one, and you shouldn't expect it or want it to be. You're merging your tastes with your partner's to create something new and fresh. With careful planning you can create a new space that you both enjoy.Strive for a new and improved merged household, rather than trying to replicate the old house. If the person is moving into your home, be willing to make big changes.
Remember that you'll need to make mutual decisions about how to improve the space from now on.

, Merging two households can be hard on kids. If children are involved in your household merge, they should be involved in the decision making. Merging households might make them feel nervous, and it's really helpful if they feel they have a say in what their new space will be like. Get the kids involved in packing, decorating, and creating a new personal space for themselves.


Let kids decide which toys to keep, and which to give away.
Get kids excited about the new and improved space. Tell them moving will be an adventure.

, Merging households means merging lifestyles. Think about all the factors in both of your lives that will be affected by the merge. Have a plan for accommodating each other's hobbies, pets, and so on.


If you have pets, where will their new hangouts be? Where will they sleep? Where will you keep their food and water dishes?
Figure out who gets what closets and storage space before you move in, so you can keep your new household organized from the get-go.
Make a plan for sharing “extra” spaces, like a nook that can be a study, craft room or reading nook depending on how you want to use it.

, Don't make the experience regretful by being a control freak. Make sure everyone has their own contribution to the home. One person shouldn't take over. Both of you should feel at home.


Allow the person with fewer items to contribute by giving them the freedom to select decorations, layout or even to decorate their own personal space. For example: office, reading nook, gym area, etc.

Be a good example.",How to Help Your Family Go Green," Choose a time when you can all get together without distractions or absent family members. Ask every family member to explain what being green means to them and what they're already doing to be green at home, work, school, and in their leisure activities.The simplest definition of being green means making choices that benefit the environment.It can be helpful to keep notes so that you can revisit the different ideas, comments, and complaints that are raised during the discussion. Allot one person to be the “record-keeper.”;
, Avoid making final decisions at this stage: each member of your family will appreciate just being heard. Take a walk around your home and property together to actually see the things that could be done differently.Try to come up with a simple list of things that your household can make changes to and that every family member can be a part of.


For example, decide that each member of your family will pack a lunch, rather than eat out. This will reduce the amount of un-recyclable waste you create, both in packaging and in drive time.Your list could also include a column that shows how the change you are planning could be beneficial to the family or other people, helping everyone to see how our choices are interconnected., At this stage, you might have come up with differing viewpoints about what matters most in going green. Talk through the ways in which you accommodate each other's preferences and reach compromises on the priorities for your household. Things affecting the priority will likely include cost, viability, utility, and level of interest. For example, it may be easier to decide that your family will use green cleaning products, rather than installing solar panels on the roof of your home.
It can be helpful to create a poster, chart, or other visual format that everyone can follow when learning new habits or implementing the changes.
Consider using the Sustainable Happiness Footprint Chart. It demonstrates how daily choices contribute to individual, community, and global well-being.This helps people to feel more motivated to engage in sustainable lifestyles so that they are not just doing it out of guilt or fear., Visit the library and borrow books on such subjects as greening your home, green cleaning, green gardening, green living, etc. and allocate different categories to different members of the family.At this stage, the family will be able to discuss the merits, costs, desirability, etc., of the suggestions as a team, making this a joint decision-making process.


You could break down research into categories such as energy conservation, water conservation, green transportation, green eating, recycling and compost, etc.
Find out what other people have done and think about how your family could use those ideas.

, Find activities in the home that everyone is able to do to be green. Pick a small project that doesn't cost much (or anything) and that is more about habit-changing than anything too complicated.Some of these things might include:


Getting into the habit of turning off lights and electronics whenever anybody leaves a room unoccupied.

Starting a compost in the garden, or maybe a worm farm.
Beginning or improving on an edible garden. Aim to eat more homegrown food that is tasty and pesticide-free; this also saves money.
Having game nights where all electronics are turned off. This is about bonding together as well as saving a little energy; it's a thoughtful gesture as well as a green one., Talk to your family about the difference between needs and wants. Teach them to buy only what they need, and to purchase items with the least amount of packaging. For example, renting a DVD or book from the library or other service, like Netflix, is better than purchasing those items new., Cans, bottles, glass, paper, and most plastics can be recycled. Be sure to sort the materials if you don’t have a mixed-use recycling bin or center near you. You can compost food and other biodegradable items as well. It is possible, through recycling and composting, to have no trash pickup., Teach family members to repair and reuse household items. Develop a mindset as a family that items need to be reused as much as possible before being discarded for good. Possible options for reuse include:


Reusing old toothbrushes
Recycling old pantyhose
Saving money by reusing household items
Reusing Styrofoam
Recycling items into home decor
Reusing fabric and clothing
As an added bonus, recycling cans and scrap metal can earn extra money, and you might like to use this as an incentive for pocket money increases!

, During this time, learn how to reuse things and make new things from old ones. Borrow some books from the library on making crafts by reusing objects, and check out the many websites devoted to this activity.Some of the things you could try include:


Making reusable grocery bags from t-shirts
Making a tote bag out of a pillow case
Making a cloth gift bag
Making a corkboard from old wine corks
Renovating old tin trays

, Water conservation activities are a great family exercise. Turning off water when brushing teeth, fixing dripping faucets the moment they're noticed, washing the car on a lawn rather than on concrete, cleaning the pool regularly so that water doesn't have to be changed, etc. can all help your family be green., Encourage the family to reduce heat and air-conditioning usage. Though everyone tends to feel temperatures differently, remind each other that adding a sweater to warm up or opening a window to cool down are good options before fiddling with the thermostat.Consider space heaters and fans for elderly, very young, or chronically ill family members who can't tolerate the temperature range the healthy young members can. Everyone's needs are different but adjustments can be made individually, rather than to the entire home.
At night, keep the bedroom temperature cooler and use blankets or layer up.

, Ask everyone how they currently get around: to work, to school, to sports events, to shopping, to the local store, etc. As a team, work out how many of the trips taken need to be by car with a single person in it. Look at how many ways you can drop the car usage down by walking, carpooling, cycling, catching public transportation, or other solutions.Arrange family outings where you all cycle or walk to a local park or other place and have fun together. Make sure you know how to dress for all sorts of weather, so that you don't let a little rain deter you.
Ask the family to plan a shared timetable together in which one car trip can manage a whole lot of errands, drop-offs, and pick-ups at the one time rather than taking the car back and forth. This can be a fantastic way of working out how to save time too!Don't forget about greening your driving, and greening your boat care.

, Unless you're already a vegetarian family, this is probably not the time to ask everyone to go veggie but at least raise it as an option. Discuss ways to eat green, including using non-disposable plates, bowls, utensils, and napkins.

, Meat-free meals could be made more frequent within the meal roster. Less meat consumption is healthy for everyone, and the environmental costs of producing milk, eggs, and meat includes increased land usage, high-protein grain for animal feed, and the production of methane., Check out websites on the slow food movement or sites that are dedicated to locovore eating habits (eating locally produced food). If anyone in the family has reservations about eating vegetarian meals, borrow some books on achieving optimal health as vegetarian or vegan, to reassure yourselves that you are going to be getting all needed nutrients.Borrow some books and DVDs from the library on this topic. A few suggestions are Michael Pollan's “The Omnivore's Dilemma,” “Food Rules,” and “In Defense of Food,” or Morgan Spurlock's DVD “Super Size Me.”

, If the budget doesn't stretch to these initially, start a savings plan. This might include retrofitting options such as insulation, solar heating, and gray water systems. Not being able to afford these straight away isn't a reason to avoid them; it's a good opportunity to agree that you will save up until you can afford them.


Purchase Energy Star appliances and recycle old ones. New appliances can sometimes be a greener choice in the long run.Learn how to heat water using solar, and make your own electricity.

, Don't expect everyone in the family to change their ways overnight but do expect everyone to need gentle reminders to change long-held habits. For family members who feel less inclined to participate, try to offer incentives to get them to at least try a few small changes. Give the reluctant family member a small project and be generous with your praise when they complete it.


Small projects include recycling bottles, cans, and paper, and turning off the water while brushing your teeth.

, Incorporate green living into your life every day by showing how it is done. Also, make it clear how simple it can be and how fulfilling it is for you. Set the example and your family members will follow.


It can be a good strategy to ask your family to help you with the green changes that you wish to make and to offer to help them with the green changes that they wish to make.

Keep wrapping.",How to Do Furoshiki (Wrap and Carry Things With Square Cloth)," Choose a silk or nylon cloth of your liking and prepare a space where you can perform the wrapping techniques.;
, This is the simplest method; it is the hand-carried wrap. This method allows you to quickly and easily create a bag for carrying a large amount of food or other products.
Tie two opposite corners together over the food or packages sitting in the middle. The cloth should already be covering the items.






Pull across the other two corners to meet together and tie.






Grab the bag in the middle to carry.







, This is a variation of the first technique, known also as the shoulder carry-wrap. This technique allows you to make an ergonomic method of carrying a large amount of food.
Place items in the middle of the cloth and tie two opposite corners across the middle.






Take one of the remaining corners and tie a side knot in it (like a candy wrapper twist).






Tie the other corner in a side knot.






Pick up the bag from the middle knot.






Sling it over your shoulder to carry the goods.







, This translates as the melon carry-wrap. It demonstrates just how strong a thin piece of cloth can be.
Place a 16 pound bowling ball (or your groceries) in the middle of the square cloth.






Bring up two adjacent corners and tie together in a large knot.






Tie the other two adjacent corners together.






Pick up one knot in each hand and feed one knot (A) through the hole formed by the other.






Pull up on knot (A) tightening the bag around the bowling ball. Just imagine doing that with an ordinary plastic grocery bag!







, This shows that Furoshiki is not only functional but also decorative. This is a bottle carry wrap. This method will make a great impression on your friends and family, especially when bringing wine as a gift, or to a party.
Lay two bottles base to base diagonally across the middle of the square wrap. be sure to keep them about a fist's width apart.






Bring one side over both bottles to meet at the other side, forming a large triangle of the cloth.






Roll the bottles in the cloth over, like a sausage.






Roll completely until there is no wrap remaining width ways.






Lift the bottles up by picking up the two lengths at the cork end of each bottle.






Tie the two ends in a knot.






Carry.







, There are many more methods of Furoshiki that can show you how to wrap just about anything. Search the internet for more ideas. Feel free to share your personal Furoshiki experiences on wikiHow.

Prepare the wall for rendering.,
Mix the render.,
Apply the scratch coat of render to the wall.,
Scratch the first coat of render to prepare it for a second coat.,
Apply the second coat of render to the wall.",How to Render a Wall," If the wall has previously been rendered and the plaster is deteriorating, start by sawing or raking as much of the old plaster away as possible. Once the old render is removed, wet the wall using a garden hose. Apply more water to walls made from very porous materials.;
, Renders are a mixture of only 3 ingredients: lime, sand, and water. Portland cement can be substituted for a portion of the lime, which will result in a stronger, but less breathable plaster. Use either hydrated lime or lime putty, and mix 1 part lime to 3 parts sand in a large bucket or wheelbarrow. You must use sand with sharp, angular grains; masonry sand is the ideal choice. Add just enough water to form the mixture into a stiff, workable paste.

, Render is most effective when it is applied in several layers, and the first layer is called the scratch coat. Apply the render to the wall as forcefully as possible to ensure that it keys into the wall well; throwing clumps of render from a trowel or from your hands in the best method. Smooth the render across the wall with a trowel. Never make repeated passes with the trowel over the same area; this will bring the lime to the surface and leave you with a weak, lime-depleted section underneath.

, Once the first coat of render is applied but not yet set, scratch the surface throughout the wall to provide a key for the next layer to adhere to. These scratches can be applied using a hand cultivator or the edges of a trowel.

, Once the first coat has been scratched and allowed to set most of the way, wet the wall again with the hose. Apply the second coat of render in the same manner as the first. If a third coat is desired, scratch the surface of the current coat to provide a key. If not, let the render dry slowly, and you are done rendering the wall.

Sit back, relax, and enjoy.",How to Create a Minimalist Home," Unless you’re just moving into a place, it’s hard to simplify an entire house at once. Focus on one room, and let that be your center of calm. Use it to inspire you to simplify the next room, and the next. Then do the same outside!;
, The biggest things in any room are the furniture, so it is always best to begin simplifying a room by looking at the furniture. The fewer pieces of furniture, the better (within reason, of course). Think of which furniture can be eliminated without sacrificing comfort and livability. Go for a few pieces of plain, simple furniture (here, an example of a minimalist coffee table) with solid, subdued colors.

, Whether looking at your furniture or anything else in the room, ask yourself if the item is truly essential. If you can live without it, get it out. Try to strip the room down to its essentials — you can always add a few choice items beyond the essentials later. Keep the whole design (house) on paper as simple as you can initially, with required components, and then slowly add décor as desired.

, Except for the furniture, your floors should be completely clear. Nothing should clutter the floor, nothing should be stacked, nothing should be stored on the floor. Once you've gotten your furniture down to the bare essentials, clear everything else on the floor — either donate it, trash it, or find a place for it out of sight.

, Same thing with all flat surfaces. Don’t have anything on them, except one or two simple decorations. Donate, trash or find an out-of-sight storage spot for everything else. It will make everything much more minimal-looking.

, Some people hang all kinds of stuff on their walls. No-can-do in a minimalist home. Clear your walls except for one or two simple pieces of nice artwork.

, This has been mentioned in the above tips, but you should store everything you need out of sight, in drawers and cabinets. Bookshelves can be used to store books or DVDs or CDs, but shouldn't have much else except a few simple decorations (not whole collections of things).

, If you are clearing flat surfaces and the floor, and storing stuff in cabinets and drawers, you’ll probably want to de-clutter your storage areas too. You can do this in a later stage if you want.

, To keep a room from being boring, you can put a simple painting, drawing or photo, framed with a subdued, solid color, on each wall if you want. Leave some walls bare if possible.

, As mentioned in the above tips, one or two simple decorations can serve as accents for a minimalist room. A vase of flowers or a small potted plant are two classic examples. If the rest of your room has subdued colors, your accents could use a bright color (such as red or yellow) to draw the eye and give a plain room a splash of energy.

, Bare windows, or simple, solid colored curtains, or simple, wooden blinds are good. Too much ornate stuff around the windows is clutter.

, Solid colors are best for floor coverings (if you have any), furniture, etc. Complex patterns, such as flowers or checkers, are visual clutter.

, You can have a splash of bright color in the room, but most of the room should be more subtle colors - white is classic minimalist, but really any solid colors that don’t stress the eyes are good (earth colors come to mind, such as blues, browns, tans, or greens).

, When you've simplified a room, you can probably do more. Give it a couple of days, then look at everything with a fresh eye. What can be eliminated? Stored out of sight? What’s not essential? You can come back to each room every few months, and sometimes you’ll discover things you can simplify even more.

, In a minimalist house, it’s important that you find a place for everything. Where does your blender go? Aim for logical spots that are close to where the thing is used, to make things more efficient, but the key is to designate a spot and stick with it.

, Once you've simplified a room, take a moment to look around and enjoy it. It’s so peaceful and satisfying. This is the reward for your hard work.

Decide what type of stone you want to install.,
Measure your wall.,
Prepare the room.,
Cut sheets of cement board to cover the wall.,
Attach the cement board to the wall.,
Apply a high-strength mortar.,
Layer on the stone in rows.,
Grout between the stones.",How to Create a Stone Accent Wall1," Make a run down to your local home improvement store and take a look at the different varieties of accenting stones they have available. For the purpose of constructing accent walls, the raw building materials are usually cut into veneers, or thin, flat sheets that are made to look like full-sized stones once they’ve been affixed to the wall. Your goal should be to pick out stone in a size, grain and color that will complement the look of the rest of the room.Light, sandy types of stones can be used to brighten up a room, while dark and neutral shades will bring a sense of modern sophistication.You can also collect your own small stones to accent the wall, if you prefer. Look for stones that are flat, have square or rounded edges and are relatively lightweight.
For a standard 8’x12’ alcove, you’ll need roughly 150-200 stones.;
, Use a tape measure to gauge the height and length of the wall you’ll be accenting. Write these measurements down in your project journal or notebook and keep it close at hand while you’re shopping for your stone. Getting a precise measurement of the wall will help you figure out exactly how much stone you’ll need to buy.Measure at least twice and make each measurement as accurate as possible to avoid any surprises in the critical stages of the project later on.
Refer back to the recorded measurements often while you work. This will help you select stones of the right shape and size to fill out the individual rows of the wall.

, Working with stone and mortar is dusty, messy work, so before you get underway, you should clear as much out of the room as possible. Remove wall hangings, big pieces of furniture and nearby shelves and cabinets, as well as the mountings for anything that goes on the wall. Put down a few drop cloths to protect the floor beneath your work space and cover what you can’t move.Don’t forget to remove electric outlet covers and pry up the baseboards if you want your accent wall to reach all the way down to the floor.Mortar is wet, gritty and easily smeared, and stone veneers produce dust that can get all over anything that’s left uncovered.

, Cement board is a type of tightly-knit reinforced fiberglass mesh that is used as a backing and support for plaster. After measuring your wall, take a utility knife or box cutter and score the cement board to fit the wall’s dimensions, then simply snap off the edges. When it comes time, you’ll apply the mortar directly to the cement board.Cement board can be hung directly over drywall.
When shaping the cement board, leave openings in the appropriate places for wall outlets and places where other items will be mounted.
You also have the option of using wire lath (made with a grid of thin steel wire rather than fiberglass) for added strength, though it will be much trickier to cut and mount., Frame the sheets of cement board and use an electric drill to screw them into place. For this, you’ll need to use 2 ¼“ screws, which will anchor the cement board firmly to the wall. Make sure you’re drilling into the reinforced studs behind the wall so that the cement board will hang securely.Scoring the cement board to size as needed will allow you to completely cover the wall.
For best results, stagger the seams of the cement board so that no four corners ever line up. This will improve the structural integrity of the boards., In a deep bucket, mix a bag of thin-set mortar. It will help to do this using a drill with a mixing paddle attachment. Scoop and spread the mortar using a notched trowel. Try to smooth on one thin, even layer of mortar with no clumps or bare spots.Measure the average width of each stone veneer and only spread on enough mortar to put up one row of stones at a time.
Scoring shallow grooves into the mortar with a notched tile trowel can help the stone veneers adhere better., Take the individual stone veneers and arrange them on the wall in whatever pattern you prefer. You might opt for a definite vertical or horizontal grain, or lump them loosely into a more natural looking configuration. Press the stone veneers firmly into the mortar to ensure that they’ll hold in place.It may be expedient to buy more compact stones, or arrange them in such a way that they don’t require cutting. If you do need to cut the stone, this will have to be done using a tile saw with a durable blade.
Attach the stones a single layer at a time to avoid making mistakes or placing stones of a similar size or shape too close together.
If you’re experiencing difficulty securing the veneers, spread a thin layer of mortar over the backside to increase their area of contact., Load a grouting bag or gun with mortar. Squeeze the mortar into the narrow gaps between the veneers to fill them. This will provide a little added stability while at the same time giving the wall a smooth, uniform appearance. Once the grout and mortar have had time to dry completely, your wall will have the look and feel of genuine stone.Make sure that you totally fill each crevice. Incompletely grouting can quickly crack and begin falling out.Grouting isn’t necessary if you prefer for your wall to have an old-fashioned “stacked” look, but it is useful for reducing the irregular appearance of especially large or oddly-shaped stones.

Pick the Location.,
Decide on what type of stone.,
Purchase footing.,
Gather your supplies.,
Weigh your options.",How to Construct a Sandstone Wall1," Make sure you aren't preventing natural run-off water from the position of the wall and footing. Observe the land in question for a few days prior to doing any work. Pay special attention to the area after it rains. You don't want to disrupt the flow of water so that it floods into your neighbor’s property., Stone walls come in different shapes and sizes. Some stone walls are similar in cut to an average 8” concrete block. Other stone walls use disproportionate stones to create a rustic look. Consider the time you’re willing to take on this project.


The disproportionate stones look the best, but take a long time to install.

, Footing is the concrete base that is used as the wall's structure. You can either use dry footing that requires you to mix it with water to activate, or purchase prepared footing.

, This type of project requires a lot of supplies that can be found at your nearest hardware store. Collect these supplies if you decide to continue:


Trowel
Garden hose with an on/off nozzle or fitting
3/8"" and 5/8"" Plywood
Work gloves
Level
Wheelbarrow
Concrete
Bucket or plastic tub (optional)
Hoe
Shovel
Rake

Purchase a faux stone veneer.,
Take the wall’s measurements.,
Apply adhesive to the wall.,
Press on the veneers.,
Allow the wall to dry.",How to Create a Stone Accent Wall2," Nowadays, many manufacturers are creating veneers using synthetic materials like fiberglass, polyurethane and recycled composites. These faux-stone veneers are lighter and easier to work with than real stone and come in many different authentic-looking shapes and colors. Do some research into which product might be right for your home.Faux-stone veneers are normally sold by the box-load, and can be found in a wide range of hues to help you find the one that matches your living space perfectly.
Companies like AirStone, ProVia, Black Bear and Centurion all offer trusted manufactured stone products.

, Map out the area of the wall you’re accenting and record these measurements for later. You can use the dimensions of the wall to deduce how much faux stone will be needed to cover it.

Consider the measurements of the veneers as listed on the box when determining how many stones you’ll need to cover your wall.

, Find out what type of adhesive is recommended for use with the faux-stone veneers you’ve purchased. Slather the adhesive across the surface of the wall using a trowel or putty knife. There’s no need to strip the wall or hang a sheet of supporting material first—the adhesive should be light enough to apply directly to the outermost layer of drywall.In many instances, manufacturers will either suggest a particular adhesive that works well with the materials their veneers are made from or formulate and supply their own.
The adhesive will form a bond with the veneers, meaning you won’t have to worry about it crumbling or coming unfastened like mortar. This also means, however, that the wall will have to be deconstructed manually if you ever want to change its appearance.

, Working 1-2 rows at a time, go down the wall in rows fitting the faux-stone veneers into the desired positions. This will probably require a little bit of forethought, as you want the wall to have a naturally varied, inconsistent finish. Press and hold the veneers until they remain in place.When you reach the end of the wall (or you just want to change up the size of your stone), you can cut the veneers to shape using a simple handsaw.If you’re having some trouble getting the veneers to stick, it can help to apply a thin coating of adhesive the back of each stone in addition to the wall itself.
Use a damp cloth to wipe away excess adhesive if it globs up between stones.

, After the last veneer is in place, the building materials will need a few hours to set up. Your best bet is to let them sit overnight so that the adhesive supporting them has plenty of time to dry and harden. In the morning, you can replace your furniture, wall hangings, outlets and other accessories and delight in the rustic sophistication of your new accent wall!Working in a dry, temperature-controlled space will ensure that the adhesive dries and sets up optimally.
Resist the urge to touch the veneers while the wall dries, and be sure to keep children and pets away.

Understand footing.,
Prepare the 2x4s.,
Mix your concrete.,
Pour the base concrete.,
Wait for the footing to dry.",How to Construct a Sandstone Wall2," Every block of wall needs to be placed on a secure footing, which is made from concrete. Footing should be poured twice as deep as the thickness of the wall and twice as wide. Measure out how large you want the wall. If you're using 8” blocks, then your footing should be at least 16"" wide. Footing is formed by using a frame of 2x4s and wooden stakes., Double the width of the concrete block with two strips of 2x4s. Hold the 2x4s in place using wooden stakes along the outer wall. The 2x4s should be positioned so that they're secured by the stakes.

, You can use concrete that you mix on-site or get concrete delivered to you. If you are going to mix your concrete on-site, purchase bags of concrete from your local home improvement store. You buy bags ranging from 60-80 lbs. Pour your concrete into a wheelbarrow, bucket, or plastic tub. Pour a small quantity of water into the concrete powder. Use a hoe to start blending the water and powder. When all of the water has been absorbed, add a little more water. Continue to add small amounts of water until your concrete is thick and smooth.

If your concrete is clumpy, it needs more water.
If you concrete is runny, then it has too much water and will not be strong enough. You will need to add more dry concrete to the mixture.
Use a bucket to add the water, not your garden hose. It's too hard to control the amount of water that comes out of a garden hose.
You can also use a small mixer to stir the concrete. If you don't have one, they are available for rent at many home improvement and hardware stores.
Use water to wash off any concrete that gets on your skin.
Wash your tools immediately after finishing to avoid having the concrete dry on them.
If your job will require more than 30 bags of concrete, it's best to order a delivery of pre-mixed concrete from a truck., This will secure your potential wall firmly to the base. Fill the frame up to the edge. Level the freshly poured concrete by running a 2x4 across the top. This will spread the concrete in an even manner. Fill any spots that are low with additional concrete., Before you can begin building, you'll need to give the concrete ample time to dry. If you expect the footing to hold a substantial amount of weight, wait up to three days for it to dry."

Lay out your stones.,
Organize by size.,
Determine your base.,
Prepare the cement mortar.",How to Construct a Sandstone Wall3," Gather all your stones and practice forming your wall as your footing dries. A large part of forming a sandstone wall if you’re using uneven blocks is patience.This requires the same amount of focus and concentration as being active in completing a 5000 piece puzzle.

, Once you have a sufficient amount of blocks, create separate piles. Separating the blocks by size could save you a headache when your mortar is wet. You’ll be stacking them from largest to smallest, so arrange your groupings in a way that makes it easier for you to access the largest stones first.


Having an ample supply of smaller stones will also help fill gaps as you work.

, Lay out your larger blocks along the dried footing and see how many you'll need for the first layer. Don't seal these down. Fit them as close as you want. You can use different sized stones to create your preferred look, but the biggest stones must be in the bottom layers. Using too many small stones near the bottom will make your structure unstable.


Use corner blocks on the corners if available.
Don’t be discouraged by a curved wall. Many sandstone walls constructed from uneven stones can turn out curvy in certain sections. This is an aesthetic choice that can stand on its own, or be cut for a straight wall., You can purchase standard mortar from your local home improvement or hardware store. Add 3-inches (7.6 cm) of water into your cleaned out wheelbarrow, bucket, or tub. Pour 3/4 of your bag of mortar into the container. Mix the mortar and water using your hoe or a small mixer. Add the rest of your bag of mortar, and stir until the mortar is consistent.


Your mortar is ready when it has the consistency of buttercream icing.
You can also find rapid set mortar, but it will only give you about one hour to work, which is not enough time for you to complete your wall."
"
Apply mortar to the corner.,
Set the initial stones.,
Select the stones.,
Check the evenness.,
Set the mortar.,
Clean the sides.,
Use a jointer.",How to Construct a Sandstone Wall4," Use your trowel to spread mortar along the corner of your wall. The mortar should be 1” thick and be the width of your perspective wall. Have the parameters of the width of your wall laid out and marked before applying mortar.Continue to spread the mortar out to cover the surrounding three stones.

, Build up the corners as you would if you were laying bricks. Use a spirit level to ensure the quoins are vertical. Next, stretch a level line from one end of the wall to the other, 300mm-400mm above the footing. Move the line up the wall as you build and use it as a guide until you reach the finished height.

, Since you’ve gathered different sized stones, select the necessary stones that will create a level first layer. Place the smaller stones in the gaps in between the larger stones to get an idea what will be level.Remember the order of stones once you find an even pattern.

, Use a mason’s level to periodically check the level of your wall. Before mortaring the smaller stones into the larger ones, measure them with the level. This will give you an idea if you need to cut any of the stones that are especially protruding., After setting the initial stones, apply mortar to the top and sides of the stone. Do not apply mortar to the side that will act as the corner. Be sure everything is even before laying anything on top of the bricks. Use your trowel to apply 1” of mortar to both the sides and top. Smooth the mortar with the trowel and ensure every stone’s mortar application is even.

, As you notice the mortar beginning to settle on the sides, clean off the excess. Use a stiff broom or whisk broom to clean the sides of your wall., If the mortar is partially wet, you can compact it for a stronger finish. Use a concave jointer and run it between the stones. This will also create a cleaner look.


Re-brush after using the jointer for a cleaner look.

Contact your local utilities office to confirm that there are no pipes or cables in your digging zone. Your local utilities office should perform this free of charge.
If you live in the USA, you must make an 811 “Digline” call and set up a time to have your property inspected to determine the location of underground utility pipes and cables before starting any digging project. This is required by law. Make the call at least a few days before you plan to start your project.
If you want more of a random outline, lay out a line for your wall using a garden hose. Simply drape the garden hose out in the general area of the proposed wall utilizing its curves. Check to see that the shape is buildable and aesthetically pleasing, and then use landscaping paint or flour to mark the ground where the garden hose was.;
, Using a shovel, dig a trench along the line you have laid out. It should be slightly wider than the blocks you will use for your wall. Check that the trench is as level as possible.


If you live in the USA, you must wait until the Digline locate process is complete before you begin excavating.
Enough space should be made to bury the bottom row of blocks at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) for every 8 inches (20.32 cm) of wall height. Factor into this equation a level of paver base that will rest on the bottom of the trench.

, Using a soil tamper — you can easily rent one for less than $20 — tamp (pack) down the bottom of the trench. Then, add 4 to 6 inches (10.16-15.24 cm) of patio paver base or rock dust to the bottom of the trench. Patio paver base is ideal because it is specially made gravel that compacts well and is sturdy.


Rake the paver base once it's been applied, getting as much uniform coverage as possible.
Go over the paver base one more time with a level, making sure that the trench area is a uniform height. If there's uneven distribution add a little more or take away some paver base by raking.
Tamp the bottom of the trench again, compacting the base a final time.

, These are the most critical blocks in your wall. If they aren't level or adequately support the top half of your retaining wall, the whole project is going to look less than professional. Make sure that the foundational blocks are leveled off, sturdy, and tightly packed together.

, Add the first block to the trench, using a cornerstone. Make sure it is level from front to back and side to side.


Alternately, if there's no edge to the wall that is more visible than another, start at the edge that will be closest to another structure (usually a house).
If you're building a straight or rectangular retaining wall, make sure that the backs of the blocks line up with one another perfectly; if you're building a curved retaining wall, make sure that the fronts of the blocks line up with one another perfectly.

, Some contractors prefer cutting off the top tongue or groove from the base stones before laying them down. Check for sturdiness yourself and knock the tongue off the block with a hammer and chisel, if necessary.




Understand that curved retaining walls with tongues may not benefit from the interlocking grooves. These grooves will need to be cut off with a hammer and chisel if the layout of the pattern does not fit the direction of the grooves.



, If you took the time to level off the bed, laying the first row should be easy. Use coarse sand where necessary to get a level finish on your foundation. Hammer the blocks down with your rubber mallet.

, Always use proper protection when cutting.

, This will provide excellent support, keeping your bottom layer from slipping back with time and erosion.

, This will prevent frost heave and keeps the soil from mixing with the backfill. Depending on how tall your retaining wall is, you may want to drape the filler along the back side of the trench or house, fill the trench with backfill until it's anchored the filter fabric down, and then drape the fabric flat out, on top of the backfill.

,, You want each layer of blocks to be different from the one below it. For example, if the wall has straight edges on the ends, the next layer should start with a block that has been cut in half.


Place the blocks onto the foundation before applying the adhesive. See how they look; ask yourself whether you need to make any significant cuts before gluing . Lay out one whole row before moving on to the next step.
If you're working with blocks that have flanged tongues, simply line up the female groove of the top block with the male groove of the bottom block.

, Press down to make sure that each layer is secured tightly against the layer beneath it. Continue until retaining wall is its preferred height.


If your wall is over 3 ft (.91 m) in height, you should offset each new row slightly back from the row below it, like very shallow stair steps. This will make your wall more stable and help create a better hold with the soil once you backfill.

, Look for a perforated pipe and lay it down the length of the retaining wall, covering it up with breathable backfill.


Make sure water can drain out of your pipe, either at the ends or through an outlet in the middle of the wall.

, Topper stones usually come in rectangular shapes, making them more difficult to install in curved retaining walls. If you need to cut topper stones to fit the curve in your retaining wall, follow this trick:


Lay stones #1 and #3 out in their pattern.
Lay stone #2 on top of #1 and #3, drawing lines on #1 and #3 where stone #2 overlaps them.
Cut stones #1 and #3 along those lines.
Line up #1 and #3 into place, snugging #2 in between.
Repeat, placing stone #4 on top of stones #3 and #5.

, Add plants, vines, or flowers as necessary. Your retaining wall is ready to be enjoyed.

Fill the cavity of the wall with rock.,
Cap off the wall.,
Back fill and clean the area.",How to Construct a Block Retaining Wall," A well designed plan will be essential in the building process. Plan out the area where you want to build your wall and make sure it is detailed and to scale, so when in the constructing process you won’t have to go off the top of your head and possibly make a mistake.;
, You will have a lot of materials to choose from, so take your time and make sure that the color and design will match your home and its surroundings. From your plans estimate how much you will need, with around 10% extra to ensure that you are covered for a possible mistake.

, Using spray paint to draw out the area that you are going to excavate is a good idea or staking it out will work as well.

, When digging out the area or trench for your wall, you are going to want to dig around 6 to 7 inches (15.2 to 17.8 cm) below the surface to allow enough depth for the gravel base for the wall. Also the trench should be roughly 14 to 16 inches (35.6 to 40.6 cm) wide.

,, Using gravel to fill the trench slowly and packing it in stages to build up the base. You are going to want to make the base around 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm), depending the height of your wall. Also you want to make sure that your base is wide enough so that your block will sit completely on the base. Also make sure the base block is at least one inch below the surface to ensure the gravel base won't wash out underneath.

, You can also use a hand packer, which would be cheaper, but not as efficient. Using a string line can help ensure a straight wall when laying the base block.

, Now that you have the base set and level as close as possible, you can now set your base row of the wall. This is going to be the most time consuming and important step of the building process. The tools needed to do this task would be a rubber mallet and 12 inch (30.5 cm) level. When setting the base block you want to make sure that it is level from front and back and side to side. Also when joining the blocks, you want to make sure they line up and are flush with each other.

,, Now is the simple task of adding the rows and the only thing to keep a close eye on is making sure the blocks line up or make a smooth bend. You can do this by looking down the wall to see if they all line up.

, This is a judgment part and a little trial and error.

, As you slowly build the wall up, you will want to fill the cavity with river rock or other medium sized rock to help will filtering the water and mud when it rains. This will also help with the back fill behind the wall instead of hauling lots of dirt in.

, Now take the wall caps and glue them to finish off the wall. You will want the cap to overhang about an inch over the final row or about the length from the tip of your index finger to that first line or bend of the finger. You may need to cut the cap with a cement saw to make the bend.

, Back fill behind the wall up to the top of the cap or just below it. Clean up the area in front of the wall to make it look good and prevent the base from washing out.

Place each post in its hole and pour quick dry cement into each hole so that the posts will stand up straight when the cement has dried.

,
Smooth out the concrete so that it is level with the top of each hole, brace the posts with 2 by 4 inch(5 by 10 centimeter) boards and allow the cement to cure for at least a week.

,
Once the cement is cured, cut your 2 by 6 inch (5 by 15 centimeter) boards to the length between your posts.,
Attach your cut boards on the outside of your posts with carriage bolts.,
Carefully fill the area behind your boards with soil until it reaches the top of the boards, and pack it down.

",How to Build a Wood Retaining Wall," Places where water tends to ooze up or stand are not good choices as the water will rot your wall and ruin it rather quickly.;

, Place a level on the surface of the ground to make sure it is level along the entire stretch where the first layer of railroad ties will be placed.

, First measure the length from one end of where you want the wall to sit to the other. Next, measure up from the ground to determine how high you want the wall to be.

, Cut any excess off one end of a railroad tie to fit your area if needed.


Make sure your ties are sitting flush on the ground by setting a level on them periodically throughout the length of the wall to check.

Severe weathering (SW) bricks can withstand direct contact with the ground and moisture. Use these for foundations, patios, garden walls, and so on.
Medium weathering (MW) bricks can withstand freezing temperatures and above ground exterior work (not direct ground contact).
No weathering (NW) bricks are for interior work only.;
, Bricks come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but the most important thing to remember is that you must adjust the size bricks you buy to account for the mortar. The most common brick, a modular brick, has ""specified"" dimensions 3⅝"" wide, 2¼"" tall, and 7⅝"" long (even if they are sold under nominal whole number measurements). They are typically used with mortar joints ½"" thick. Taking the mortar into account, each brick will take up 4⅛"" x 2¾"" x 8¼"" of space.You must add the mortar measurements when planning your wall. The combination measurement of brick and mortar is called the brick's ""nominal"" size.Three rows of bricks stacked on top of each other will be 8"" tall.
For example, to make a wall 2 ft tall x 6 ft long, calculate (24"" / 2¾"") for height and (72"" / 8¼"") for length, rounding up. In this case, you'll need 81 bricks, 9 rows tall x 9 bricks long.
Purchase at least five extra bricks to cut in half to begin new rows, plus an additional one brick per row in case of damaged bricks.
If the ground is uneven or sloped, plan to install an additional one or two rows of bricks below the finished grade level to create a level base.

, You need to dig out a trench to seat the wall in, which you then make solid with a layer of concrete. This is often called a footer, or concrete foundation. Dig out a rectangular trench the length and width of your planned wall, roughly 1 foot deep.









If your wall is more than 2 feet tall, you may need a deeper or wider trench. If the ""footer"" you install (as described below) is not strong enough to support the wall, the wall can sag or collapse. You can look up recommended dimensions online based on your soil's load bearing capacity and the size of your project.Make sure the footer will have good water drainage away from the wall. Water pooling around the footer can cause wall failure.

, Take several wooden stakes and drive them into the soil so that the tops of them are all level. Find the nominal height of your bricks (the height of the bricks plus 1/2"" for mortar), then drive the posts so that they are all this height below the top of the trench. Use a level to ensure that the tops of the stakes are completely level.For this example, with 2-2/3"" bricks, you would want 2-2/3"" of space between the top of your guide posts and the lip of the trench. This is so the first row of bricks is completely seated in your foundation.
Space these posts 2-4 feet apart, depending on the length of your wall.

, Fill in the trench up to the top of the stakes, leaving the space you measured for your bricks. The concrete needs 2-3 days to dry and set, so use this time to start gathering supplies and preparing your measurements.








Use a finishing trowel to make sure the top of the concrete is smooth and level before it starts drying.
You can notch a ""keyway joint"" or ""V"" into the middle of the footer to help interlock it into the mortar bed.

, Also called gauging rods, these will ensure that your wall is level. Take 2 long wooden boards or posts and measure out each row of the brick wall, also known as a course. Mark the boards where each brick should be, including the mortar lines. Make sure you can drive the posts into the ground so that they can be freestanding. They should be as tall as your wall will be.


For the 2x6ft wall, make a mark 2-1/4"" up from the bottom -- this is the height of the first brick. Make another mark 1/2"" above that, then continue this pattern up to the top of the wall, here 2 feet high. You want two of these, one for each side of the wall.These rods will be the rulers for your wall, and need to be identically lined up. Use a level and your tape measure to make sure the wall is immaculately planned.

, You'll need quite a bit of stuff to build your wall, all things considered. Once the foundation is set and your guideposts are built, it's time to get your building materials in order. You will need:String and clamps/nails (to create guidelines)
Mortar and a mixing bucket
Level
Brick jointer
Club hammer
Tape measure
Water
Dry bristle brush
Tarps or plywood to lay at base of wall
Small torpedo level to check individual bricks
4 ft level

, Lay down tarps or 2 ft wide plywood at the base of the wall to catch excess mortar as it falls. Keep this surface clean and avoid walking on it so you can reuse this mortar., Space them out appropriately, accounting for the mortar. Use your tape measure to make sure that they are the correct distance apart, and make sure that they fit in the trench snugly. Plan out the whole first row like this before you start any work.









If you do not have bricklaying experience, read through this entire section first. You may need to practice a few techniques before you begin.

, This is going to be for the second layer of bricks, as the first one will be buried in the trench. Run the string from one gauging rod to the other so that you have a straight, level line to work with.


Don't let the line sag. This must be kept ""true"" for a solid, level wall without major structural issues., Soak the bricks in water, then lay them out to drip dry. The bricks should be thoroughly wet so the mortar bonds correctly. That said, wait until there is no more water running off the bricks, or the mortar may become too runny., When in doubt, add a little bit extra mortar, as you will be pushing the brick down slightly. Use your trowel to lightly press into the mortar along the center line, leaving little intents. The mortar will look like little waves., Push down slightly, then use your level to check that the brick even with the ground. To do so, press the level up against the side of the brick and then check it with your string sting line.









Scrape any excess mortar down the line. You can use this mortar for the next bricks as long as it is free from contaminants.

, Once you're sure your first brick is set, lay down some mortar for the next few. You only want to work with 2-3 bricks worth of mortar at a time.

, Take a slab of mortar and coat the end of the brick that will be pushed up against the first brick. You want a nice, even pat of mortar, just a little more than a 1/2"" worth. Press it into place against to the first brick and use your tape measure to make sure they are 1/2"" apart and joined by mortar.


This is a very important step that ensures a strong bond between bricks. If you skip this and try to fill the mortar in between laid bricks, the joint will eventually fail. For best results, practice this several times on spare bricks before you move on to the real wall.

, Use the level to ensure that the bricks are flush and at an even height, pushing on them lightly to make sure that they are perfect.








, You've pressed the bricks together, you'll notice that mortar starts to squeeze out as you work to get 1







, Continue laying bricks down in this fashion -- mortar bottom and side, press in, check evenness with the level-- until your first row, or course, is complete.


You can never check if the wall is level enough. You should be using your level and tape measure with almost every brick.

, It should be the 1/2 mortar marker that joins your 1st and 2nd rows. For the second row it should already be in place, but you need to remember to move the line each time you move up a row so that you know the height you have to hit.

, You can also use a bolster, which may make a cleaner cut. Still, bricks are meant to break cleanly. Tap on the point you want to cut the brick with the back of a hammer until you see a crack, then hit this spot hard, once, to cut the brick in half.You need to stagger your bricks, meaning that one brick in the second row sits on two bricks in the row below it. To do this, you'll start every other new row with half a brick.
You don't need a perfectly clean, smooth cut. The rough edges will help hold the mortar.

, You do not want to make the next row right on top of the first one, so that the joints line up. Mortar and place the half brick, then place a full brick next it like normal. Do this on both ends of the wall, so that each side has a half brick and a full brick in place.

, To help you stay level, you build the ends of the wall up a course higher than you're working on, making it appear like there are staircases on the ends of the wall. You then fill in the bottom row, build the sides up a little higher, then continue until you reach the top.Remember to use the guideline and your level together to make sure the bricks are even and at the right height.
Your gauging rods should help you place the end bricks, as they will line up right with the marks planted at the end of your wall.

, Place roughly 1/2"" of mortar down, press the brick into place, check the straightness with the guideline and level, and wipe up any excess mortar. Then repeat until the second row is done.

, You want to have the ends of your wall one course higher than the row you are currently working on. This is especially important if the wall has pillars on either end. With each row, the process is the same. However, remember to use half-bricks every other row to ensure that the joints in each row are not perfectly lined up.


Move the guideline.
Apply mortar.
Press a brick into either end of the wall, using the guidelines and level to make sure they are at the right height.
Do the same thing one row above the one you're currently working on.
Measure, mortar, and build the bottommost row, (infill the courses).
Repeat the process one row higher., Depending on what you built, you can finish your wall by turning or angling your bricks differently at any time. Popular options include:



Soldiering, or standing the bricks up so that they are up straight, like soldiers at attention.

Headers are when the shortest side of the brick points out. The top row of bricks is spun 90 degrees from the bottom one., Use your trowel to fill in any patches or gaps in the joints, making sure there is a nice, even amount of mortar holding your wall together. Wait roughly 45-60 minutes before continuing -- the mortar should be slightly hardened, but not set, before moving on.

, Brick jointers are cheap little tools that help you get the professional, curved in joints on your wall. Firmly press the tool into the joints and run it down the mortar, trimming and polishing your wall.







, A single brick width wall is easy to make, but not incredibly strong. More common is a double-brick wall, which can be easily adapted to your needs. Instead of alternating half bricks with full ones you simply need to alternate turning each brick on the ends, since 1 brick is as long as the width of two bricks. Every other row would begin with a brick that faces perpendicular to the direction of the wall, helping you keep the joints staggered.To help you remember where to place the bricks, think of how the wall looks when you're facing it. Every other row has a small, ""square"" brick, followed by the long bricks running parallel to the wall.

, Pillars are not incredibly difficult to add, but they do take some planning. They are basically squared ""mini-wall,"" designed so that half of middle bricks ""pokes out"" into the wall, connecting everything together. Once you've decided on your pillar design, make sure you build them up at least 1-2 rows higher than the courses in between. You need to build the pillars up a few rows, then fill in the wall between them, only getting to the top of the wall after you've already finished both pillars."

Backfill the bottom row with gravel both on the inside and the outside.,
Cut rod for your wall.,

Scoop the concrete into the voids in the wall.,
Insert the J bolts.,
Wet the concrete with a hose at least once a day if it's hot and dry.,
Continue around the perimeter of your foundation, until you meet at the end.",How to Build a Mortarless Concrete Stem Wall," Set up batter boards at the corners and run masonry lines between them along the perimeter of the proposed wall. Batter boards are two stakes with a crossmember between them. Any scrap wood can be used. The line is attached to the crossmember, and when you've got the line right where you want it, pound a nail in and wrap the line around it to hold it in place. The lines will be used as guides; as you lay the block the outside of the wall will be flush with the line. To square up the lines, measure your diagonals (they should be equal), and/or use 3, 4, 5 triangles to make sure each corner is 90 degrees.;
, Begin the wall at the lowest elevation of your foundation, and run bottom rows until they go completely below grade. If the foundation is a stone/gravel mix make sure it's tamped very well before you lay the block--wetting it can help. Use a rubber mallet to pound each block into position, both level and plumb, and against your line.


The bottom row is the toughest, because it's painstaking work. But every row above it is effortless - you just set the block down in a running bond. It's best if your wall is at least 2 blocks high so they interlock.







, This helps plant the wall, keeps it dry, and keeps growth and roots back away from it.

, The rod can be ordered in 20' lengths along with the cement from the same place you got the block--order it all together. Go with 3/8"" rod so that you can cut it by hand with bolt cutters. Depending on the steel, some 3/8"" can be cut just like you'd cut a branch with a trimmer. Some can be tougher and you'll need to put your weight behind it; just lay the rod on the ground, as well as the bolt cutters, and press down with all your weight on the top handle. Cut the rod 12"" longer than the height of the wall, so that you can pound it down and through your foundation. Measure and cut rod for every void in the block. This will give tremendous stability to the wall.

, If you're making it from scratch with sand, gravel, and cement, figure out a ratio that works (typically 1 part cement to 2 1/2 sand to 3 1/2 gravel) and will fit comfortably in your wheelbarrow. Try a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket for proportions: 2 gallons (7.6 L) cement, 5 gallons (18.9 L) sand, and a heaping bucketful of gravel (6 to 7 gallons). Mix the sand and gravel and cement thoroughly before you add water. Stir in a liter or two of water at a time and mix well until the concrete is the right consistency--like a heavy wet batter. Mix with a mason's hoe; a garden hoe will work also. It's hard work--do it in the shade.

, It should be a chunky slop that fills all the space yet isn't runny. If it's a tad on the dry side mash it down with your spade. When a void is completely filled, smooth across the top with a trowel.

, Use the longest bolts you can find, and make sure they stick up at least 2 1/2"", if not 3"", above the stem wall, to make room for your sill plate and the washer and nut that goes on above it. If you do the math you'd think 2"" would be sufficient, but if your board for the sill plate is warped you'll wish you had 3"". Make sure to pack concrete down around the bolt once you've got it in straight, and smooth around it with the trowel. If any concrete gets on the threads of the bolt it can be removed with a wire brush.

, This will allow the concrete to cure properly. The longer it takes, the harder it sets. You can also cover fresh concrete with large sheets of plastic or cardboard to hold moisture in.

, It's better to move in two directions from one point, and meet at the opposite corner, than start and end at the same place. This minimizes getting off course and going too high or too low with one stretch of your wall.

Brush the paint or stain onto the wood.,
Allow the finish to dry completely.,
Arrange the individual slats or lattice over the frame of the screen.,
Fasten the slats or lattice to the larger frame.,

Position the screen to conceal your garbage can area.",How to Build a Garbage Can Screen," A typical privacy screen project calls for several pieces of pressure-treated lumber, including multiple 4”x4” (89x89mm) posts and 1”x4” (19x89mm) and 2”x4” (38x89mm) boards. You'll also need some strong fasteners rated for outdoor use, a standard hammer or electric drill and a gallon of paint or wood stain to achieve an aesthetic finish that matches the look of your home. Compile a list before making a trip to your local home improvement store so that you can acquire everything in one trip.It will also help to own or have access to a circular saw and Kreg jig, though these tools are not required.
In most cases, you can find all the materials you need to construct a simple garbage can enclosure for less than $100.;
, Run a tape measure from one end of the receptacle to the other, then repeat on the perpendicular side. Add 5-6 inches (approximately 12-15 centimeters) to both measurements to provide for adequate clearance. Your can make your enclosure as roomy or as space-efficient as you see fit.The idea is to approximate how much square or rectangular space you’ll need to conceal one or more garbage cans entirely without obstructing your access to them.
Write down the measurements you take so you can refer to them when cutting the lumber to size.

, The boards that will form the frame’s upright supports should be slightly taller than the receptacle you’ll be covering, while the connecting horizontal pieces should correspond to the length measurements you took earlier. Make sure the cuts are consistent so that the finished screen won’t be misaligned. Sand rough cut edges to smooth them out.The exact dimensions of the enclosure will depend on the size and number of receptacles you’re trying to block from view.
Most home improvement stores will cut lumber for a variety of projects at little or no cost. This will be extremely helpful if you have no means of sawing the boards on your own.

, Nail or screw the shorter horizontal boards between the longer vertical supports at the top and bottom. You should be able to see the basic outline of the screen beginning to take shape. Leave the center of each frame section open for now—you’ll be overlaying these with a wooden lattice or slats later on.A Kreg jig can come in handy during this task. Subtle pocket holes will hide a profusion of screwheads and give your screen a more natural, organic look.

, At this point, you can halt construction just long enough to brush your building materials with an attractive finish. Stretch out a dropcloth or plastic tarp and place the frame sections on top to prepare your work area.It will be much easier to paint the screen’s individual components before they’ve been pieced together.
You can also rest the wooden pieces on a pair of sawhorses while you paint for added neatness and convenience., Clean the surface of the wood with soapy water before applying your finish to ensure that it will hold. Go slowly and use long, smooth strokes to maximize your coverage. Apply two coats of paint for a bolder color and greater durability. Stain unfinished wood until it reaches the desired depth of detail.Choose a semigloss acrylic or latex paint formulated specifically for outdoor use. A smoother type of paint will repel dirt and help protect the wood from precipitation and general exposure.Paint the screen in a shade that complements the color of your home, or use a light stain to emphasizes the rustic charm of the wood you’ve chosen for the project.When using paints and stains, always work in a well-ventilated, open area to avoid inhaling irritating fumes., The finish will need to be dry to the touch before you proceed to piece everything together. This will ordinarily take anywhere between 2-5 hours.Check the label on the paint or stain you're using to get an idea of exactly how much time it will require to properly cure.
The wood may require more time to properly cure if you applied the finish during wet weather conditions or live in a climate with a high humidity.
Frequent exposure to moisture can cause wood to swell, split and rot. Consider adding an additional sealant if you think precipitation might be an issue., Once again, the exact size, number and dimension of the slats is largely up to you. Measure the total area of the frame’s inner edge and divide that number by the average width of the slats so that you’ll have an idea of how they should be spaced.Be sure you’ve purchased enough materials to provide slats for each section of the screen.

, Rest the cut 1”x4” (19x89mm) boards across the frame laterally, then nail them into place. For lattice screens, place the precut lattice over the frame on what will be the reverse side and fasten the edges using nails or staples. Now all that’s left to do is fit the separate sections together.Nail the top and bottom corners of each slat to make sure they'll hold.
You won't need to fasten every strip of a lattice individually. Instead, work your way down the strips, nailing or stapling every third or fourth one.

, Line up the frame sections in the correct orientation. On a basic two-paneled screen, the sections should form a right angle. If you’re constructing an enclosure from three or more sections, arrange them to make a “U” shape or square. Secure the edges using nails or wood screws.Use a clamp or a dab of wood glue to hold the pieces of the frame together while you prepare to fasten them.
Fasten the frame at the top, bottom and along the middle for increased stability.

, Take things a step further by installing a few extra pieces of hardware. After installing a door, your trash receptacle will be completely invisible to nearby onlookers. Jointed frame sections will allow you to adjust the position of the screen as you please, which may come in handy for beautifying areas that are oddly shaped or change frequently. Offset your hinges roughly 6-10 inches (approximately 15-25 centimeters) from the top and bottom of the door or jointed panel.
Larger areas can create an opportunity to include more elaborate features, such as a swinging gate.Ornament the door of your privacy screen with a stylish set of knobs, handles or pulls.

, Set up the finished screen and enjoy the newfound curb appeal it offers. Make sure you’re able to slide your receptacle in and out of the screen with ease. Now you’ll never again have to deal with seeing piled up rubbish laying out in the open!L-shaped screens can act as an extension of your home to hide unsightly trash from your neighbors.

Plan your project.,
Select your stones from a stone supply yard.,
Lay out the wall area and direction.,
Dig a ditch the length of the wall that is about a foot wide and 8 to 12 inches (20.5 cm - 30.5 cm) below the ground level.,
Stack the larger rocks in the ditch.,
Fill dirt behind the large rocks and tap the earth firmly, while letting the 8 degree slant hold the rock in place by gravity.,
Find complementary rocks to fill in the spaces in between the large rocks.,
Continue placing the second layer of rocks, so that spaces between the first layer of large rocks are filled.,
Square off the top of the wall with smaller stones to give it a neat, straight and flat appearance.

",How to Build a Dry Stack Retaining Rock Wall," Decide how wide and long you'd like your rock wall to be, and make sure that this is feasible with the location of your wall.


Dry stacked rock walls are typically built against a hillside, as it can be used as a tool to prevent soil erosion from ruining a garden ;
, Give a representative your measurements, as that affects the quantity and size of stones you need. Dry stack walls can typically be made from three types of stones: round field stones, relatively flat stacking stones and uniformly cut dressed stones.Each type will give your wall a different look and feel, so make sure you look at pictures to determine which would be the best fit for your house and landscape.
Note that flatter stones tend to be easier to work with than rounder ones, as they are more suited for stacking.

, You may be cutting away a bank (shown below) or building the wall and back filling as you go, in order to create a terrace effect. Pull a string line the length of the wall (about 8 inches (20.5 cm) off the ground level) to define the front of the wall.


Freestanding dry rock walls can be stable if they are up to three feet in height, This ditch will act as the wall's footing and prevent the rocks from sliding forward due to pressure from the earth behind.


Try to cut the ditch into native soil rather than loose added soil, as the former provides a more stable foundation for the wall.
Level the foundation trench. Smooth over the ground beneath your wall with a shovel, and line it with crushed stone pieces called stone screenings, stone dust or fines.This material will also be useful for filling in gaps.

, Place the flat side facing forward, and slanted back about 8 degrees. The rock should just miss touching the string line, and be supported by dirt filled in behind it. Do this for the length of the wall, with each large rock touching the one next to it.

,


Avoid large vertical gaps in your wall. Try to rearrange the stones so that those don't appear.

, These rocks may be smaller, but need to be a shape that fills the void between the large rocks. Lay the rock flat side out and support it with earth filled in behind it. These rocks also lay back by 8 degrees.

, Fill out the entire span of the trench. You can add water to the fill to make it settle.

Hang sturdy paper on wall using a staple gun.,
Put on gloves and lay down a tarp.,
Apply foam to wall, leaving about 1"" around the edges to allow the foam to expand (again, we will trim this later).,
Once foam is dry, mix the portland in a five-gallon bucket with enough water to create a paint-like texture.,
Once Portland mixture is dry, use textured spray paint to create shadows and details on your wall.,
Trim paper around edges (remember the 1"" we left?),
Add other props and embellishments to suit your needs.

",How to Make a Fake Rock Wall," Staple every 4-6"" along the edges to ensure that the paper will hold the weight of the foam and portland. Overlap paper about 6"" and seal off edges with packaging tape. Be sure paper is cut to about 1"" larger than the area you want to cover. It will be trimmed at the end.;
, This foam is very difficult to remove from skin and other surfaces (tile, carpet, walls, etc). If you don't want foam on it, cover it up.

, Shake the can thoroughly and hold it upside down when you spray the foam (as per instructions on can). Spray foam directly into gloved hand and smear a thin layer (1/4"" or so) onto paper. Don't worry about spreading the foam into an even layer. Uneven layers will add texture and shape to your wall. As round bubbles appear, smooth over them with your gloved hand to shape the texture. Add any details now (like crags, shelves, etc) with the foam. Change gloves as needed (you may find that you need to change gloves after each can). Foam will expand for about 30 minutes. Cover entire area and let dry for approximately 2-4 hours, depending on how thick you applied the foam.

, Using a large brush, ""paint"" the portland mixture onto the wall. It helps if you only mix a little at a time (make about 2 gallons, use it, then make more). Let portland dry on the wall overnight (or approximately 8 hours). Portland will dry a light grey color, but you can add cement dyes or stains in if you wish. These can be picked up at your local hardware store.

, Pick colors that are natural and would look good with your other decorations (e.g. a spray paint with a thick, large-grained texture).

Minimize impervious surfaces on your property.,
Line impervious surfaces with gravel trenches.,
Use the water that drains off your roof.,

Add organic matter to your soil.,
Don't leave soil exposed.,
Plant trees and preserve existing ones.,
Don't create runoff when washing your car.,
Create a rain garden.,
Reduce the slope of your yard.,
Install berms and vegetated swales.",How to Reduce Stormwater Runoff at Your Home," In nature, most precipitation soaks into the ground where it falls. Plants absorb much of this through their roots, and some makes its way down to the water table, being purified as it gradually percolates through the soil. The ""built environment,"" however, is characterized by impervious surfaces (surfaces that don't absorb water), so that a large portion of rainfall or snow melt becomes storm water runoff. Reducing the amount of impervious surface on your property therefore reduces the amount of runoff.


Replace concrete or asphalt slabs with pavers. You can use paving stones or bricks for patios, walkways, and driveways. Water can seep down into the spaces between the individual pavers, thus reducing the amount of runoff.
Take out the center of your driveway. Only the tires of your car touch the ground, so two strips of pavement should suffice for a driveway. You can then plant grass or mulch the center of the driveway, reducing the amount of pavement substantially.
Replace all or part of your driveway with the kind of pavers shown here. Low plants can even grow up between the openings.
Replace the pavement at the bottom of your driveway with a French drain or grate. This will collect the water that falls on the rest of your driveway and allow it to soak into the ground, rather than flowing into the and, eventually, into waterways. Installing a French drain with the capacity to take in all the runoff from your driveway can be very expensive, but every little bit helps.
If an area must be paved, use porous asphalt or permeable concrete, which will allow at least some water to soak into the ground. Keep in mind that the effectiveness of these materials is limited because water tends to run off them before it can permeate them, especially if there's any slope. It's also important to make sure there is a percolation field of permeable ground beneath the pavement.;
, Figure out where water runs off your driveway or patio, and then dig a small trench along the edge. Fill it with gravel to slow the runoff and allow the water to seep into the soil.

, A 1,000 square foot roof can produce more than 600 gallons (2,271.2 L) of runoff for every 1"" of rain that falls on it. If your downspouts are connected directly to a storm drain, disconnecting them is the single most important step you can take to reduce runoff. Instead of allowing water to go directly into the sewer or to run into the street, direct your downspouts toward a vegetated area, such as your garden or lawn. Use extensions to ensure the water comes out at least 5 feet (1.5 m) away from your foundation. Alternatively, install rain barrels or cisterns to collect the water so you can reduce the risk of soggy yards or basement flooding and save some rain for a sunny day. If you don't have any way to make good use of the stored water, consider Dutch drains, gravel-filled barrels with holes at the bottom which slow the flow of water to allow the ground to absorb it all.

, Lawns aren't particularly effective at absorbing and retaining water, especially during heavy rains. This is a problem not only because more natural precipitation runs off them, but also because they may require a lot of irrigation, which in turn can create even more runoff. Native plants, such as shrubs and wildflowers, tend to develop more extensive root systems that take in and hold water much better than lawns. As an added bonus, they require less maintenance than a lawn does. If you do decide to keep your lawn, though, water it efficiently to conserve water and reduce runoff.

, Adding compost or mulch to your soil can make your plants happier, but it can also reduce runoff. Spread a 2-4"" layer of organic material once a year.

, Depending on your slope and soil type, bare soil can be nearly as impervious as concrete. If you can't or don't wish to plant vegetation on an exposed patch of soil, cover it with mulch, wood chips, or gravel. This is especially important for newly landscaped yards that don't yet have established vegetation.

, Trees' immense root systems effectively absorb water over a large area. In addition, the canopy of a tree slows the fall of rainwater so that the ground is capable of absorbing larger amounts than it otherwise would be. Plant native trees or trees which take in a lot of water and are well adapted to your environment, and take care of your existing trees. For new home constructions, leave trees in place if possible.

, Bring your car to a car wash (preferably one that recycles its water), or wash your car on your lawn. You can also wash a car without water, if you prefer.

, A rain garden is a garden, planted in a slight depression in the ground, that collects water and allows it to gradually permeate into the soil. Rain gardens come in many sizes and are typically planted at the base of a slope or even at the outlet to a downspout--anywhere where water naturally flows or can be directed. Water-loving plants and a base of permeable soil enhanced with fertile loam and a topcoat of mulch allow the rain garden to quickly absorb even large amounts of water, usually in just a few hours.

, If your yard has a severe slope, the soil will have a hard time absorbing even moderate rains. Consider excavating to make steep slopes more gradual. In order to prevent basement flooding and foundation damage, make sure there is an adequate slope away from the house for at least 10–15 feet (3.0–4.6 m).

, A berm is a slightly raised area, while a swale is ditch with a mild slope. Berms can be used to slow runoff on steep slopes, and swales planted with grass or other plants can direct water to a rain garden. Swales can also direct water toward a storm drain or street: since they significantly reduce the amount of runoff, very little water that enters a vegetated swale will actually make it to the street or drain.

Clean the inside of the barrel.,
Know what to expect.",How to Make a Rain Barrel1," This is trickier than it sounds.


You will usually be placing your barrel under, or attached to, one of your existing downspouts. However, you need to ensure that the rain barrel uses a diverter or has an overflow to get rid of water pooling at your home's foundation.
A full rain barrel can weigh more than 400 pounds, so make sure you don't place it on anything that can't take this weight, or where it might do damage if knocked over.;
, This will depend on the size of your property, but the standard size is 55 gallons (208.2 L).

, You can use plastic, rubber, or even wood. Metal can be used but is often not recommended. Just make sure your material is sealed and treated to hold water for a long time without leaking, rusting, rotting or decaying chemicals into the water.

, This may not be a big deal if your barrel is new, but make sure you remove any debris that may be left inside.

, A rain barrel is just a barrel with a hole in the top or side allowing water to enter from the downspout. It can have a filter or closed system to keep out debris and mosquitoes. It always has a spigot and/or drain valve near the bottom to connect a hose to or fill a bucket from. The rain barrel should also have a way to control overflow.

Locate your water meter.,
Remove the cover of the meter box if applicable.,
Lift the protective cap on the meter if applicable.,
Determine the volume of water used by your household.,
Determine the amount of water your household uses.,
Calculate the cost of your water usage.,
Consider changing your usage pattern.",How to Read a Water Meter," If you live in a single-family home in a small city or suburb, your meter box will likely be located in the front of your property near the street. The meter may be housed in a concrete box in the front yard marked ""water."" If you live in an apartment or condominium, the water meters for your property will likely be located in a single room, often a utility room on the basement or ground level, or could be located on the building exterior. If your water bill is included in the cost of your rent or home owner's association dues, then your entire building is metered from a single meter.;
, If your water meter is housed in a concrete box, the cover should have several small holes in the top of it. Place a screwdriver in one of the holes and pry the cover off just enough to get your fingers under the edge. Lift the cover off and set it aside.

, Some water meters will have a heavy metal cap over the dial to protect it from damage. Lift this cap on its hinge to expose the dial.

, On the face of the water meter, you will see a large dial and a series of numbers. The numbers represent the volume of water used by your household since the last time the meter was reset.


The units for this measurement will be specified on the dial face; common units are gallons or cubic feet in the United States and liters or cubic meters in much of the rest of the world.
The odometer (yes, similar in function to that of your car) shows the total amount of water that has been consumed by the household since it was installed. It does not reset every month or billing cycle; you can only track your monthly consumption level by recording it. The last two numbers on the odometer will often be on white numerals on a black background, while the rest are black numerals on a white background. The last two numbers represent whole single units (gallons, liters, cubic feet, or cubic meters) and tens of units (they are not decimals, as some assume).
The large rotating dial shows the partial units that have been consumed. Each number on the dial represents a tenth of a unit, and the tick marks between them depict the hundredths of a unit.
There should also be much smaller gear- or triangle-shaped dial on the meter face as well. This is the ""low flow indicator."" If you suspect there is a leak somewhere between the meter and the interior of your home (meaning water that you are not able to use but will be billed for), shut off all water inside your house and check the indicator. If it is rotating, water flow is continuing (even if it is at a very slow rate).

, To track your water usage, begin by writing down the reading on the meter. Wait a specified period of time (a full day or full week, for example), and then write down the new reading. Subtract the first reading from the second to determine how much water you used during that time period. If you are trying to reconcile your own readings with the figures on your water bill, remember that your municipality won't always take readings at the same time each month.

, If you want to calculate the cost of the water you use, you'll need to determine how the water is billed. Look at your water bill to determine the billing unit; this is usually bigger than the metered unit, and is commonly expressed as 100 gallons, 100 liters, or 100 cubic feet. The unit rate will be printed on your bill, which is the price paid per billing unit consumed. Convert your total water consumption into the billing unit, and then multiply by the billing rate to determine the cost of the water.

, Are you using more water than you thought you did? There are a number of steps you can take to reduce your water usage, such as washing a few large loads of laundry instead of many smaller loads, or taking shorter showers. For additional ideas on how to reduce your consumption, see here.

Use a jigsaw to cut a hole in the top of the barrel.,
Position the skimmer basket or screen.",How to Make a Rain Barrel2," The hole should be large enough to accommodate the rainwater flowing into it from out of your rain spout. A four to six inch diameter circle is a good place to start, or however large you need to accommodate your skimmer basket.


If the top of your barrel is thinner, you can also just use an exacto-knife.

, You want to make sure that leaves, sticks and other debris, as well as bugs and animals don't get into your barrel.


For this you can secure a screen over the intake hole (or simply cover the entire top of the barrel and put the top back on). Make sure you don't use metal screening that will rust, or anything with gaps big enough to let in mosquitoes.
You can also set a special skimmer basket into the intake. A skimmer basket doesn't block as easily and can be removed to toss out collected debris and make maintenance easier.

Drill a hole for the spigot.,
Wrap tape around the upper threads of the spigot.,
Insert the spigot onto the barrel and seal around it.",How to Make a Rain Barrel3," It should be as close to the bottom of the barrel as possible, with the stand leaving you enough room to fill a bucket under it. Use an electric drill. A 3/4th inch hole should be right to fit most hose-compatible spigots. But pick your spigot before you decide what size hole to make!

, Teflon tape is a good choice to make sure your spigot is watertight.

, Screw your spigot into your hole and secure it to the barrel with a properly sized washer. Then seal over the edges around the spigot with waterproof sealant or more teflon tape.

, Four cinder blocks set next to each other should do the trick on flat ground. You can also use loose bricks. Make sure your stand is completely stable—you don't want your barrel to tip.

, You may need to adjust your downspout and even add curved sections of gutter piping to get it properly positioned.

, Make sure it sits secure and stable and doesn't tip around. Turn it so the end of your house's downspout flows down into the intake.

Drill a hole in the side toward the top of the barrel.,
Screw in and secure your valve.,
Attach a hose to the valve and direct the hose to run into a ditch or other proper drainage near your house.,
Alternatively you can simply use a diverter.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Rain Barrel5," About two inches should be good. When the barrel fills up, you need an overflow valve to let water run out in a controlled way instead of bubbling out the top.

, As with the spigot, use tape and washers to lock and seal it in place.

, This will keep your yard from flooding when water starts spewing out of your barrel.


You can also run the hose into a second rain barrel. This way when the first fills up, the water just flows into the next one. But eventually you will need to have a barrel that drains properly.

, A downspout diverter attaches to the downspout and the rain barrel. Once the rain barrel is full, water continues down the downspout, eliminating any chance of overflow,"

, Each is marked with an asterisk (*).

The dossifier or proportioner which lets chlorine into the system is labelled filter and is just below the water tank in the vertical run of pipe.
The tee, drain pipe, and drain tap (drain valve) are the other components you will be adding.

,, Your chlorine dosifier is just an add-on to what you already have, so your supplies will have to match the specifications of your existing tubing and fittings. To add some bleach to the water in your water tank, you will need access to the system and you'll achieve this by using a water filter with the filter cartridge removed.

, To have room to add the bleach, you will need to drain some water. For this, you need a tee joint, some length of tubing and a tap placed on the drain pipe. (See sketch with labeled items.)
, The filter should be at elbow height for ease of use. Take utmost care when cutting the vertical water tank line: You have to take into account the length of the filter itself. Determine it with some spare useless length of tubing. Wear working gloves and tighten the fittings using curved pliers or a special spanner., Follow the same procedure and precautions as with the filter., Place the tap anywhere that is handy. As the drain pipe has a free end, there is no need to take care with the measurements., The normal setup to supply water to the tank is: Main Tap open, Drain Tap closed and Filter Cap threaded tightly on. - The moment there is some pressure, the water will flow into the tank.
, The setup to start draining is: Main Tap closed, Drain Tap open and Filter Cap still tightly on., Ensure that almost no water is flowing from the drain pipe and then carefully unscrew the filter tap. This way you'll avoid getting wetted by the water contained in the pipe above the filter.
, The setup for adding bleach is: Main Tap closed, Drain Tap closed and Filter Cap off. The fill line for the tank should be drained almost completely. Pour in a sensible amount of bleach, bearing in mind the capacity of your water tank and the concentration of chlorine in the bleach you’re using.









,

Screw the filter cap tightly back on and open the main valve (Tap A).
The incoming water flow will push the bleach into the water tank where it will get distributed through into the water making the water, if not drinkable, at least germ-free and safe.

This is especially useful if you have a household member who leaves the tap running!, It is difficult to tell how much water gets used to produce dishes, but disposable dishes like paper or plastic plates use much less water in your home. Paper plates can't be recycled, but plastic dishes that don't have food on them can go in the recycling bin. Try scraping or wiping food off plastic plates instead of rinsing them off., Don’t use the faucet to power-wash food off your plates. Scrape off solid food and garbage with a utensil over the garbage can or compost bucket. Don’t use the garbage disposal to get rid of food scraps--it uses water too., Before you start washing, put all the dirty dishes next to the sink or dishwasher so you don’t have to turn the faucet on and off while bringing the dishes over. Be sure to check the rest of your home for stray coffee cups or snack plates., The sooner you start washing your dishes after eating, the less water you’ll use. If you let food harden on your dishes, you’ll need to use more water to soak them and wash them."

Create or identify a surface suitable for rainwater collection.,
Set up a collection point for water on the catchment.,
Connect the collection point to a conveyance system.,
Install a storage system that can work close to your home.,
Connect the storage unit to the conveyance system.,
Develop a system for water retrieval.,
Add filtration mechanisms (optional).",How to Harvest Rain Water in a Household Setting," The easiest way to collect rainwater is to channel the water that runs off of a broad surface. This surface is known as a ""catchment area.""The most commonly used and easily adapted catchment area is the roof of a house. In some states that heavily regulate water collection and storage by individuals, this is actually the only legal catchment surface allowed for rainwater collection.Because rainwater can collect at the base of any sloped surface, the options are quite varied. You may even notice that water forms a temporary stream as it runs down the gullies of a hill on your property. This water can also be collected and stored for later use.;
,


In the case of your roof, the gutters of your house may already serve to collect the water. They catch the water as it runs off and thus allow you to capture it for your own use.
For the hypothetical hill example referenced earlier, you can excavate a wide but relatively shallow hole or basin at a point in the gully. The water will collect there as it runs down the natural channel., Quite simply, the ""conveyance system"" is just some form of tube or channel that transports the water to a storage unit.Most gutters already have some form of piping that is used to expel the rainwater a distance from the foundation of the house. However, most such arrangements are inadequate for the requirements of rainwater collection. If the water should become backed up in the tubes, the water could overwhelm you gutters and either spill over or weigh down the gutters to the point where their braces collapse. If you live in a high rainfall region or one in which rains come down in sudden bursts, you must have high quality tubes or pipes that lead to the storage unit.
If the water collection point is at ground level, you can dig a channel that leads to a storage unit. However, keep in mind that the channel must have a sufficient slope to keep the water moving. That fact may ultimately determine the location of you collection point.

, The biggest barrier to rainwater collection is the matter of storage. It is only useful to collect rainwater if it can be done in large quantities, but it is not always easy to determine the best means of doing so.Above ground storage options can be as simple as a barrel, or a number of barrels connected in series.Alternatively, you may choose to use a single large underground tank or cistern. Because of the size of any water tank, it may not be the item that you want in your backyard. In these cases, it could be best to excavate a sizable area for the purpose of installing an underground tank. The use of an underground tank increases the likelihood that soil or pollutants will enter the water as small cracks or breaks appear in the tank or pipes. However, if you have limited space this may be your best option.
Yet another option is to use an above ground open reservoir to hold the water that you have collected. A layer of concrete or densely packed gravel can prevent the water from absorbing into the ground. However, in areas that are especially dry, this method would likely result in the loss of all or most of the water through evaporation before it could be used. Additionally, because of town and city ordinances against open reservoirs (but that usually except chlorinated pools) such a reservoir is not really a valid option for anyone but those who live in rural regions.

, Extend the pipes or channels to the barrels, cisterns, or reservoir that will be used. Remember that the best conveyance systems are powered by gravity. If the storage unit is above the level of the pipes or channel, it will have to be pumped into the barrels or tank. If you intend to use a gas or electric pump to do so, the savings that come with collecting free water will be diminished.

, You must be able to draw water from the storage units whenever it is needed.


For those with above-ground barrels or tanks, the usual method is to elevate the storage units and place a release spigot near the bottom of the unit. Pressure from the water above the point of the spigot will push out the water below.
Below-ground tanks will require some form of pump. When selecting a pump, you must determine the quantity of pressure required to do the job. If, for example, you are trying to water your lawn you must calculate the quantity of pressure needed to push the water through the hose(s). Keep in mind as well that pressure can be lost due to friction, and long pipes or hoses serving as your water retrieval system can result in greatly diminished pressures.

, Though the water that you collect from a rooftop or hillside should not be drank, it may still be a good idea to install filters of some sort. The pipe and storage tanks could fill or become clogged with dirt. Because some chemicals may be present in the rainwater in your area--and will only be concentrated in your storage tanks--you may also want to partially purify the water before using it on your garden or lawn. Install these between the collection and conveyance sections if you are using pipes, or between the conveyance system and storage unit if you are using a channel. You could also filter the water as it leaves the storage unit to make sure that it is at its cleanest when you decide to use it.

Rinse your dishes in standing water.,
Collect water from drying dishes.",How to Conserve Water when Doing Dishes2," Using too much detergent can increase your water usage--if you have big, fluffy suds towering over your sink, you’ll need much more water to rinse those dishes off. Use the amount specified on the label, and add more only if necessary., Instead of washing each dish individually in running water, fill up your sink with water and detergent, turn off the tap, and wash a stack of dishes at a time. Don’t drain or refill the sink unless the water becomes cold, dirty, or loses all its suds., Don’t run the tap over your clean dishes to rinse them off! Instead, fill up the sink or a large bowl with cool water and rinse your dishes by immersing them in the water. You won’t need to refill the rinsing water unless it gets very soapy.

, Put a tray under your drying rack to catch water dripping off your dishes. You can use this water for your plants or for washing your countertops."

Check regularly for clogs, broken spinners, and other problems. If your dishwasher needs replacing, consider buying an energy-efficient model to save even more water., Many newer dishwashers don’t require pre-rinsing at all, so if you have one, you can skip rinsing completely. If you do have to rinse dishes before running the dishwasher, use the washer’s pre-rinse cycle instead of rinsing them in the sink--it uses less water., Don’t run a load of dinner plates on the pots and pans setting--it wastes water! Use the lowest setting on your dishwasher that will still get your dishes clean, and save high settings for big messes., If your dinner didn’t use up enough dishes to fill the dishwasher, wait until after breakfast to run it. Running partially-filled dishwasher loads wastes water. If you need a specific dish but the dishwasher isn’t full yet, wash it individually by hand in a bowl of warm soapy water instead of running the entire dishwasher."

If enough rain is forecast in the coming days, you can avoid the task altogether and conserve water at the same time., By putting a moisture meter in your garden, you can take some of the guesswork out of watering efficiently. Available at most hardware stores, a moisture meter is one of the most cost effective tools for conserving water in your garden. Take a look at the reading to determine whether you should water the garden:If the meter reads 10-30% moisture, you’ll need to water your garden.
If the meter reads 40-70% moisture, you don’t need to water.
If the meter reads 80-100% moisture, you should avoid watering, since your soil is likely too moist for most plants.

, Grab your watering can or turn on your drip irrigation system before it gets too hot and windy, which will give your plants the necessary supply of water to make it through the rest of the day.Avoid watering your garden in the evening because it is more likely for water to stay on leaves, which could lead to fungal growth.
If you do container gardening with a pine bark potting mix, you’ll want to water your plants in the afternoon. Although this goes against the normal rule of watering your plants in the morning, container plants watered at this time seem to grow stronger and healthier., A smart irrigation controller is a tool that uses local and national weather data to automatically adjust the irrigation of your garden. You can save a lot of water by using these systems, which allow you to monitor irrigation from an app on your smart phone.Some of the systems, such as the Rachio Iro Smart Sprinkler Controller, can be programmed to adjust to local weather changes, such as skipping a scheduled watering if rain pops up in the forecast.Systems cost in the range of $200 and $1,250.
In some regions, you can get a rebate for using a smart irrigation controller.You may be able to save 9% of your water use per year by using a smart irrigation controller.

Find out the source of your home's water.,
Is your well water treated (chlorinated) or untreated?,
Chlorine is also inexpensive to administer and maintain; it keeps the entire water system cleaner and freer of algae, bacteria and other pipe and holding tank contaminants.,
Is there dirt, turbidity, or other organic matter in your well or spring water?,
Reverse osmosis and distillation, by themselves, do not remove bacteria, viruses, and some chemicals; all reputable RO and distiller units are always coupled with good carbon filtration, preferably carbon block, to ensure removal of these contaminants.

,
Learn about specific water contaminants in your area.,
Find out about the use of pesticide chemicals in your area.,
Determine if your city receives its water from surface water or groundwater sources.,
Find out if your community fluoridates its water.,
Evaluate the needs of your family.,
Learn about your home's plumbing system.,
Recognize that some believe that distillation is the only method in which water can be purified.,
However, the problem is that distillation, by itself, does not remove all chemical pollution.,
The other problem with distilled water itself is that the water is lacking an ion, and it aggressively attaches to calcium and other minerals in the body, and flushes them out.,
Take all of the above factors into consideration when researching and purchasing a water treatment system.,
Testing is the only way to determine if your water is suitable for drinking and other uses.,
Understand that testing is only telling you what was in your water at the moment the water sample was taken.",How to Choose the Best Method of Water Treatment," If you are receiving water from a well on your property rather than municipally treated water, your needs will be much different.;
, Chlorination will kill all bacteria and virus -- then the chlorine can be completely removed by a good whole house pre-filter and/or chlorine-removing fixtures in the bathrooms, coupled with a solid carbon block drinking water system at the kitchen tap.

, (This is in contrast to ultraviolet (UV) radiation to kill bacteria and viruses. UV is expensive to buy, expensive to maintain and only disinfects for a short length of the pipe downstream from the light.)

, Put a good 10 to 15 micron pre-filter to remove these big chunks before they hit your house taps.

,, A lot of this information can be found out through the EPA. Also, each year your city should produce a water safety report, discussing the incidence of specific contaminants in your city's water. However, using a filter that removes the widest range of contaminants overall guarantees that you will be protected, no matter what the contamination.

, Water in Midwestern states is much more likely to contain chemicals from pesticide runoff. In fact, any agricultural area is subject to groundwater contamination from pesticides, herbicides and fertilization by-products.

, Groundwater is much cleaner, overall, and may need only mild treatment with a home water filter. However shallow wells or dug well can be contaminated by pesticides, petroleum spills and animal droppings. In either case, there is contamination that can be removed by the right technology.

, Fluoride can be particularly damaging to the elderly and has been linked to cases of Alzheimer's disease. If complete fluoride removal is a concern for you, consider the RO technology coupled with solid carbon block, to guarantee fluoride-free drinking water.

, If anyone in your family is prone to asthma or respiratory illness, you will want to cut down on chlorine fumes in your home with the use of a whole house pre-filter that can remove 80+% of the chlorine entering the home, or put a chlorine-removing shower head (or chlorine-removing tub ball) in every bathroom.

, Many homes built before 1998 contain lead in their pipes that can corrode into drinking water. If you have lead pipes, you will definitely need a point-of-use water treatment system that is certified by an American National Standards Institute accredited certification body such as WQA Gold Seal or NSF International to remove all lead.

, The thinking goes that the only real definition for pure water is ""H20"" with a complete absence of any contaminants. Distillation mimics the hydrologic cycle of evaporation (boiling to steam), precipitation (precipitation in an apparatus), normally a condensing coil), and condensation leading to rain (water cooled usually by a fan and and drips into a sterile container).

, Some chemicals evaporate and re-condense, just like the water, and pass through with the ""pure"" water. All reputable distillers have good carbon post-filters, such as a carbon block, to completely clean all the water coming through the unit.

, For a short time cleaning agent for the body, in the case of health problems, distilled water can work well. But for an everyday, lifetime beverage, distilled water is actually unhealthy over time, and can negatively affect teeth, bones and other bodily processes dependent on trace minerals. At the very least, you need to take mineral supplementation to counteract this factor.

, The EPA recommends that if you have a well it should be tested annually for bacteria and other impurities. Remember that not only do you drink water but you brush your teeth and wash your fruits and vegetables and dishes in water that could be contaminated.

, You can have the test performed by a chemist or a certified laboratory; you can go to your local water board and get the most recent water quality testing reports that they provide to the public.

, A day, a week, a month or later, you could have contamination from any number of sources come through your pipes and you would never know it. While testing is valuable, the better use of your dollars would be to put in a system that is certified to remove the most contaminants -- in this way, you have total peace of mind. Search certified product listings on WQA Gold Seal or NSF International websites.

Collect run-off water in rain barrels, or even large polyethylene, wood or fiberglass tanks.,
Install a rainwater collection system.,
Create a rainwater garden.,
Use rain chains instead of traditional downspouts.,
Adapt household and yard products to catch rainwater.",How to Collect Rain Water,"


Rain barrels are containers that can be bought at your local hardware or home improvement store, or you can make one yourself.
Rain barrels are made from plastic and are positioned below down spouts to collect water that runs off of the roof. They have a spout at the bottom to release water. You can connect a garden hose to the valve and use the water in other areas of your yard.
They usually run on gravity. This means you'll have to use a pump if you need to water an area that is at a higher elevation than your rain barrel.
New styles of rain barrels have covers to keep mosquitoes, animals and children out. Rain barrels should also be secured to keep them from tipping over.;
,


Rainwater collection systems (also called rainwater catchment systems) consist of large tanks stored underground that can collect rainwater from the roof and gutters and then filter and pump the water out for whole-house use. You can use your rainwater for cooking, showering, laundry, watering your lawn or washing your car.
Rainwater systems are expensive and must be professionally installed. You must have a pump or pressure tank to move the water.

,


Simple rainwater gardens harvest the rain from your roof or gutters to create a water garden or to water the immediate garden area. The water is not available for use in other areas.
You can also use this process to mask an underground storage tank and pump. This allows you to use the water from the water garden in other areas, even inside the house. These can be simple or elaborate, depending on your budget, and usually require professional installation.

Rain chains are a decorative alternative to conventional downspouts. Usually made from copper, the rain chain guides the rain from your roof, down the chain--or through cups--and into your garden, watering can, rain barrel or other rainwater collection system.

,


Simple items such as watering cans, children's swimming pools and pots can be used to collect rainwater for use in watering your plants and garden. Be sure that large items used to collect water are carefully monitored if you have children or pets. Water collected in open containers should also be used quickly or covered to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.

Install a rain barrel.,
Water your garden with cooking water.,
Reuse your shower water.",How to Conserve Water in Your Garden2," Instead of letting rain fall from your roof onto the street and into the storm drains, you could catch it in a barrel! You can purchase rain barrel collection systems from larger hardware stores. If you don’t have the time to set one up yourself, you may be able to find a local gardening company that will install it for you.Rain barrels cost between $80 and $100.

, The next time you boil some potatoes, you could pour the leftover cooking water into a plastic bucket. When you go out to water your garden, use the bucket of potato water to nourish a few of the plants.If you have a fish tank, you could save the fishwater the next time you clean the tank. Use it to water part of your garden.

, Put a bucket in the shower before turning it on. As you wait for the water temperature to warm up, you’ll be catching the water that would normally go down the drain. Put the bucket on your porch and use it to water a few plants the next time you have to water the garden."
"
Mulch your garden with bark chip mulch.,
Use bokashi buckets to improve soil moisture.,
Add organic matter to your soil to improve moisture retention.",How to Conserve Water in Your Garden3," Because mulch prevents water from evaporating and holds moisture in the soil, it is an excellent way to conserve water. Choose a coarser mulch such as bark chip mulch, which will allow water to move down into the soil. Apply 3 or 4 inches (8-10 centimeters) of mulch to your garden bed.If you are container gardening, you can use 3-5 centimeters in your pot.

, Get two buckets of the same size. Drill twelve holes into the base of one, and then put it into the other bucket. Put food scraps into the top bucket, and the fermented liquid will drip into the bottom bucket. You can use the liquid to fertilize your plants, and add the food scraps as compost to your garden. In this way, you can improve the moisture and health of your garden soil., Add worm castings and compost to your garden soil to improve its structure and ability to retain moisture. Your garden soil will stay moist and retain nutrients for longer with the regular addition of compost."
"
Design your garden with different watering zones.,
Improve watering efficiency with a drip irrigation system.,
Choose native plants that are adapted to local rainfall patterns.,
Plant drought-resistant plants that need less water.,
Choose slow growing and small plants.,
Make a berm around water intensive trees and shrubs.,
Install porous garden paths that reduce run-off.",How to Conserve Water in Your Garden4," Put plants with similar watering needs together, so that you avoid overwatering plants that have low water requirements simply because they are beside plants that need a lot of water.For instance, you could put all of your high water plants close to a bog.
You should also be familiar with the type of plants and shrubs you have in your yard and garden so that you know what their exact watering needs are.
If you have plants in containers, you can place the big ones so that they give shadow to the small plants. With more shade, the small plants will lose less water to evaporation.

, Because drip irrigation systems deliver the water directly to the root systems in your garden, they are much more efficient. The water goes right to your plants without running off or evaporating. Connect a soaker hose to your tap and run it through your garden bed. Whenever you want to water the bed, just turn on the hose.Spray irrigation, such as a sprinkler, is only 50-75% efficient.
Drip irrigation is 95-99% efficient.
You can also use a smart irrigation controller to run your drip irrigation system.
You can also install drip irrigation for a lawn but it needs to be subsurface by four to six feet., Since native plants are adapted to your local climate, they won’t need much water beyond the regular rainfall for your region.You can find native plants for your region by contacting your local native plant society.You can search for your local native plant society by visiting the North American Native Plant Society website.If you live in Alberta, you can visit the website of the Alberta Native Plants Council.If you live in California, you can contact the California Native Plant Society., One of the best ways to garden with less water is to choose varieties that are drought-resistant, which often have silver and grey-green leaves that reflect sun rays. Another way to spot a drought-resistant variety is the fine hairs that grow on their stems and leaves, which trap moisture. Some drought-resistant plants include:Mimosa (Acacia dealbata)
Hop tree (ptelea trifoliata ‘Aurea’)
Lawson cypress (chamaecyparis lawsoniana)
Sacred bamboo (Nandina domestica)
Silver jubilee (Ozothamnusrosmarinfolius)
Verbena
Echinops
Bidens
Felicia

, When you are planting, you should choose slower growing and smaller plants, which require less water. Similarly, you should avoid large leafed plants, which tend to use a lot of water., If you have some young trees that need a lot of water, you could make a little berm around them. Pile up the earth in a donut shape around the tree. When it rains, the berm will catch the water and direct it towards the tree that needs it., When you make your garden paths, use bricks, gravel, or pebbles, which will allow the water to seep into the ground and nourish the plants. Otherwise, the water could flow down into your driveway and into the street."
"
Consider location.,
Buy a cistern or ""bury"" tank if you want to buy a tank for water storage below ground.,
Get the right tank for your transportation mode, if you want to buy a tank to haul water.,
Stick to a septic tank if you need to install a septic system.",How to Choose the Right Water Tank," If you are buying a tank for water storage there are two basic options: above ground storage and below ground storage. The above ground storage tanks come in two basic styles: the white tank and the black tank. The main difference is that the black tank can absorb heat better than the white tank, which means that it can help prevent some growth of algae and other water borne organisms. The above ground tanks are smooth and round.
, These types of water tanks are rectangular and are not smooth. They have a ribbed construction, which makes them more sturdy than above ground tanks and allows the tank to be buried in the ground. If you try to bury a tank that was designed to be used above ground, it will collapse and most likely will crack., When hauling water in a pick-up truck, there are tanks that are designed specifically to fit in the bed of trucks. They are designed so that the bottom of the tank will rest on the bed and the top of the tank sits on or above the wheel wells of the bed of the truck. If you need a larger capacity tank to haul water in and you want to haul it using a trailer, the better option would be an Elliptical Tank. The gallon capacity goes much higher than a pick-up tank and they can be secured to a trailer by using metal bands that are designed to fit in groves on the tank.

, Septic tanks resemble that of a cistern tank, but are usually in a different color, such as yellow or blue. These tanks come in a one compartment or two compartment model. Depending on where you live will determine the number of compartments that your tank needs to have. Since this is a septic tank, it is used only for waste from the plumbing in the home and not for water storage."

Check to see if you can get a better contract, or make payments based on average monthly cost.,
Buy energy efficient devices.,
Switch off and unplug devices when not in use.",How to Save Money on Electricity1," Research online and offline to help you understand your spending. Paying on line can save you and paying quarterly or monthly should be considered. Direct Debit payments sometimes attract a small discount.


Determine how much electricity you use. Use the electricity bills from the last year to calculate an approximate value.
(If possible) Compare different offers from electrical companies; choose the one that is the cheapest (lowest cost per kilowatt hour).
Find out if there is an OFF-PEAK time of the day when the rate is lower and use that time for most electricity needs (e.g. running washing machine, dishwasher, or cooking). This may require additional costs for special metering hardware to track usage during those times.;
, Don't buy devices that are bigger than necessary (buy and use small pressure cookers whenever possible). Ask for energy efficient devices. Don't forget to check the stand-by consumption. Check if there is a label like Energy Star or an energy class label.

, Use a power strip with a switch, that way you'll only have to flip a switch to unplug your devices.


If a device doesn't have an on/off switch, use a plug connector with an on/off switch. Connect, for example, your TV and the loudspeakers with a plug connector. You can switch off both devices by just one action. Connect your DVD recorder with a separate socket since it is likely that you would have to readjust it if you switch it off.
Some power adapters (transformers for rechargeable appliances) also consume energy. Unplug them when not in use.

Get wet, then turn off the water while you soap up. Turn it back on for long enough to rinse. Look for a twist valve that installs behind your shower head to keep the water temperature where you set it while the water is off.


Use a bucket or bowl to catch the cold water that comes out of the faucet, tap, or shower while you are waiting for the hot water. Use it to water plants or pour into your toilet reservoir after flushing.
Water from a hot water tank may have more sediment or rust than water from the cold water tank, but is otherwise suitable for drinking. If you use a water filter, you can filter the saved water, and put it in bottles in the refrigerator for drinking water.;
, Fix anything you find leaking. A silent toilet leak could waste from 30 to 500 gallons every day!

, Low-flow devices are inexpensive ($10-$20 for a shower head and less than $5 for a faucet aerator). Most simply screw into place (you may need an adjustable wrench), and good, current units maintain the pressure and feel of the flow while using as little as half as much water as conventional units.

, Take a timer, clock, or stopwatch into the bathroom with you and challenge yourself to cut down your showering time. You could even play music while in the shower and challenge yourself to cut down the number of songs it takes you. Shave outside the shower, or turn off the shower while you shave.



Take showers rather than baths. By taking a bath, you are using up to 100 liters of water! Showering will generally use less than a third of this amount. See the water use table below.
Install a valve that fits just behind the shower head. These valves are inexpensive and simply screw into place. Turn the water on for long enough to get wet. Then, use the valve to turn the water off while preserving the temperature of the water while you soap up. Turn the water on again to rinse.

, If possible, hook up a hose to the outlet on your machine to send the water outside onto your garden. To re-use bathwater use a hand-operated Syphon Pump. When hand-washing dishes, rinse the dishes into a container, and empty the container into your garden.


Graywater should never be used on edible plants other than mature fruit trees due to a risk of contamination.
Graywater should always be ""filtered"" through some kind of medium. This can be something as simple as pea gravel or woodchips. One thought behind this is that it exposes the water to more surface area allowing naturally occurring bacteria to help clean the water.
Collect water for re-use anytime you are running the water waiting for a particular temperature. Simply run it into a bucket, watering can, or pitcher.
If you collect clean water (such as while adjusting water temperature), you also can use it to hand wash delicate clothing.
Also collect water that you use for rinsing produce and for boiling pasta or eggs.
Use garden-compatible soaps and cleaning products if you collect graywater for gardening. Most soaps contain salts that can build up in the soil of your garden, which is not good for plants.
If you're not sure whether gray water is suitable for plants, you can use it to flush your toilet. Either pour it directly into the bowl, or (provided there is no sediment) use it to refill the toilet tank when you flush.

, Place a plastic bottle of water in the tank to displace some of the water used for each flush. Weigh the bottle down with pebbles or sand, if necessary. Or, try ordering a 'save-a-flush' or 'hippo' from your local water board.


Not all toilets will be able to flush effectively with a reduced amount of water, so make sure that you check that your toilet does.Make sure there's a lid on the bottle, especially if there are pebbles or sand weighing it down. You don't want any pebbles or sand loose in your toilet tank.
Upgrade to a low-flush toilet. Low flush toilets exist that can flush reliably with 1.6 gallons (6 liters) of water and less. Read product reviews to find a good one.

, This is basically a toilet that flushes a smaller amount of water for when you pee and more water for pooping, thereby saving water. Use the half flush button with a dual-flush toilet.


You can also buy a dual flush conversion kit to turn your water guzzling toilet into a water saver you can be proud of. Search the web for devices like Selectaflush and Twoflush. They both work well and save money.

, Don't flush every time. Remember: ""If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown flush it down."" Also, don't use your toilet as a trash can. Each time you flush you use up to 9 liters of clean water, which is a lot of unnecessary waste!

, Old-style top-loading washers use 40 to 45 gallons per load, and the average family of four runs 300 loads per year. High-efficiency washers, typically front-loading, use only 15 to 30 gallons per load. This works out to a savings of 11,400 to 34,000 liters (3000 to 9000 gallons) per year.

, Wait until you have a full load of clothes before you wash a load. Don't wash a load of clothes just because you want to wear the same pair of pants the next day! When washing your clothes be sure to use the economy mode and this will save you both water and electricity! This goes for dishwashers, too. Load the dishwasher full but not overly full.


Don't wash your dishes before you wash your dishes. Do scrape larger pieces of food waste into the trash or compost. If your dishes don't get clean without pre-rinsing, make sure you're loading properly, that your dishwasher is in good repair, and that you're using an effective dishwasher detergent.
Dishwashers, especially modern, efficient ones, can actually save water compared to washing by hand, since they pump the same water around inside the tub. If you're ready for a new dishwasher, check both energy and water usage before you buy.
Choose your next washing machine wisely, too. Front loaders use far less water than top loaders.
Choose laundry detergents that rinse cleanly and don't require an extra rinse.

, For this, you and your family will have to produce less laundry, but you will save time and wear and tear on your fabrics, as well. Unless your clothes are obviously dirty or smell bad there is really no point in washing them.


Hang towels on a rack to air dry after you shower. Use them multiple times between washings. It will help if each family member has his or her own towel. Get several coordinating colors, if need be.
Wear clothing more than once. You can also wear the same pajamas for a few nights in a row, especially if you shower before bed. Do change socks and underwear daily, but wear slacks, jeans, and skirts more than once between washings. Wear sweatshirts and sweaters over a t-shirt or tank top and just change only the innermost layer.
Don't change clothes midday. If you have something especially messy to do, such as painting, gardening, or working out, set aside one set of old clothes for that purpose and wear it multiple times between washing, too. If possible, time such activities so they happen just before your regular shower so you don't use additional clothing or take additional showers.

, Garbage disposals use a lot of water to get rid of the garbage, and are completely unnecessary. Collect solids in the trash can or a homemade compost bin rather than washing them down the sink., You might be very surprised to find out how much water you are actually using. By installing a water meter you can raise your awareness and consequently reduce your water intake.


If you already have a water meter, learn how to read it. Among other things, it can be very helpful in detecting leaks. Read the meter once, wait an hour or two without running any water, and read it again. If it has moved, something is leaking.
Many water meters have a small wheel or gear that turns fairly rapidly if any water at all is flowing. If you are sure all your water is turned off and you see this wheel moving at all, you have a leak.
If your water meter is underground, you may need to remove debris from the face to read it. Squirt it with a bit of water from a spray bottle to clear the surface.

, This helps to prevent evaporation. In some places, emptying and refilling a pool is under severe restrictions, or even banned, so preserving this precious resource is crucial.

, Put a timer on your sprinkler and outdoor faucets/taps. Look for inexpensive, automatic timers that screw between the hose and the hose bib, or install a programmable timer on your sprinkler or drip system. An automatic timer can also help you water at times of day when the water can best be absorbed.


If you water something manually, set a kitchen timer before you turn the water on, or stay with the hose the whole time.
Know how to adjust your sprinkler and irrigation timer settings for the seasons. Water less or not at all during wetter, cooler weather.
Don't over-water, and don't water any faster than the soil can absorb the water. If water is running off the lawn onto the sidewalk, cut the watering time or divide it into two smaller segments to allow time for the water to absorb.

, If you have irrigation on timers, watch it run. Fix broken sprinkler heads and pipes and make sure that spray patterns are directed where they are intended.]


Consider using a drip irrigation system or something similar to save even more water. Explore using native plants that can survive with minimal irrigation (once established).

, Use a trigger nozzle hose and/or bucket. There are even waterless spray-and-wipe car wash products, but they tend to be costly.


Wash the car less often. Everyday dust and dirt won't harm anything if it collects for a little while.
Wash the car at a car wash. Car washes may use less water than you can use at home. Car washes also collect and filter the wastewater appropriately.
Use environmentally friendly cleansers. This will enable you to reuse wastewater from washing to water the lawn or garden.

, Use a broom or rake, or leaf blower to remove dry matter and let the rain do the rest. Using a hose will only wastewater and it won't hydrate anything.

, Only water the areas that need it, and only when there has not been enough rain. Use a trigger nozzle on your house or use a watering can to save water. You can also, catch the rain and use it for watering your plants, lawn or garden.


Water the garden and lawn at night. Watering at night gives water more time to soak in without added evaporation from the day's heat.
Water deeply but less often. This will encourage plants to grow deeper roots, so that they need water less frequently. The roots of grass don't grow as deep as those of other plants, but they can still be encouraged by deeper, less-frequent watering.
One way to water deeply with a minimum of water is to water slowly using drip irrigation or micro sprinklers. The simplest form is a soaker hose; other options include drip tape or hoses with emitters. These systems do not lose water to evaporation like overhead irrigation and keep plant foliage dry to help lessen disease. Buried tape applies the water to the root zone for even greater efficiency. These systems may need to have acid added to the water to keep calcium or iron from plugging the tiny emitters.

, Don't mow your lawn too short. Raise the height of your mower blade, or simply let it grow a bit longer between mowing. This way you won't have to use as much water.


Grow no grass or less grass. Plant something besides a lawn or reduce the size of your lawn. Lawns require much more water (and maintenance) to keep growing than many other plants and ground covers.
If you live in an area with infrequent rain, consider not planting grass and instead using plants from your area that don't need as much attention and water.

, Plant small trees under big trees. This will help prevent evaporation and provides some shade for your plants. You can also plant a shade garden under trees.


Native species will be adapted to local water supplies, and therefore need less supplemental water.
Consult with your local nursery on xeriscaping (landscaping that minimizes or eliminates the need for irrigation, such as using native plants) designs.
Know how much water plants need to thrive, and don't apply more water than that.
Grow plants with like water needs together. Sometimes called ""hydro-zoning,"" this method simply means that plants are grouped together by water use, so that they can all be watered appropriately.
Use furrows and basins. Dig low areas to water only the root zones of your plants, not bare areas around them.
Use sub-irrigated raised bed gardens (for example wicking beds, global buckets, Olla irrigation, and Earthbox planters).

, Ideal mulch candidates include composted manure, leaves, wood chips, bark, cardboard and newspaper (but not any glossy printed pages, such as pull-out ads). Many mulches are available for free or very low cost. The right organic mulch can also help improve your soil as it breaks down and keep weeds in check., It may not be something you think about, but everything you eat used varying amounts of water to produce — that's virtual water. In fact, this doesn't just apply to your food — the clothes you wear, the furniture you buy, the notebook you write in — it takes water to produce all of those things. Here are some ways to pick things that used the least amount., There are many different sites that can help you with this, such as this one. You can even download an app to your smartphone that can serve as a quick reference guide., Beef is one of the most ""costly"" proteins, and goat or chicken is one of the least. , All of those other beverages —wine, tea, soda, juice — they all took water to produce, too. Instead of drinking coconut water — it takes 550 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of coconut — just hydrate with plain water., The steps it takes to process things use water, too. By eating food closer to how it came from the source, you cut down on those steps. , That t-shirt? 713 gallons of water. 500 sheets of paper? 1,320 gallons. Reduce, reuse, recycle is usually the best policy when it comes to the environment, and trying to save water is no exception. This means reusable products, such as dishes instead of paper plates, or reusable as opposed to plastic bags, are better.

You may label some tentative areas as open space areas, flowerbeds, or other designations, but you'll be able to plan this better once you've collected some data.


It is a great idea to draw your yard. Use some graph paper for the best results and most accurate layout.;
, Xeriscaping is all about matching the plants to the existing environment, and part of that is finding out how much sun different areas of your garden receive. Every few hours, record where the sun is shining on your map. Keep in mind that the site's exposure to sunlight will also vary at different times of the year. A perennial plant used to the equatorial tropics is not a great choice for an area with cold, dark winters.


One way to mark this on your map is to draw dotted lines around the area receiving sun, and label the area inside them with the time of day. At the end of the day, write in approximately how many hours of sunlight each area received, based on the dotted lines.
Note any shaded areas that may happen as the sun moves throughout the day, such as areas under and around trees, awnings, buildings etc.

, Your local agricultural government office, or your local cooperative extension in the US, can analyze your soil for you if you send in sample. This will give you plentiful information which you can use when selecting plants, or when adding soil additions to your garden. Each plant has a preferred range of pH levels, soil types, and nutrient levels which may be included on the label or available through an online search.


If you want to increase the nutrients or water retention in your soil, mix in 1–2 inches of compost or other rotted organic matter six inches deep.If a soil analysis is not feasible, consider using plants native to your area only, which often do not require soil adjustments., Look up your area's Hardiness Zone on the USDA website by searching for you area, or by referring to the chart defining zones by minimum annual temperatures. Search online for your region's annual rainfall as well. Focus on plants with a hardiness rating and preferred rainfall levels suitable for your area, so your garden will thrive without expending extra effort and resources.


If annual rainfall is concentrated in a short ""monsoon"" period, you may need plants that can withstand a wide range of water levels, or plant annual plants that thrive either in the monsoon season or the dry season.

, Obtain a list of plants appropriate for your region using USDA guidelines, a regional gardening book, or the example section below. Focus on native plants if possible, and match their requirements to your garden conditions. As described in more detail below, your xeriscaped garden will be planted in ""layers"" surrounding each focal point or ""oasis"" with high visibility and good water retention, such a tree or house.The basic plan involves:


Oases with bright, eye-catching species that are well-suited to local conditions.
A transition area around each oasis, with plants with lower water requirements.
Arid zones with low water retention or low visibility, where more drought-tolerant, low-maintenance plants are kept.

, These areas will receive the most water and attention, so you can select plants that require more frequent watering. Maximize the use of this water by choosing highly visible areas and large, attractive plants. Seek out the following characteristics if possible to make the best use of existing water conditions:


Areas close to large structures, fences, or trees that help retain water, especially structures without much direct sun.Areas at the base of slopes or roofs with rain runoff, or next to ditches and ponds.
Areas that experience less direct sunlight, so less water evaporates.

, Some sides of the oasis, especially if it is near a structure, may get a lot more sunlight than others. Since some plants can take more sun and heat than others, plant the more sun-friendly, drought-tolerant plants where most of the afternoon sun will be located. Depending on water levels in the area, you may want to plan out additional water retention steps:


Consider growing plants within containers to maximize water retention, especially if there is not much water runoff in your garden.

Build a retaining wall if the existing structures are not large enough to retain water.

, If you want an area of turf for kids, animals, or sports players, plan it out carefully so you only plant in areas where it will be used. Lawns require significant amounts of water, so try to place it near oases or other water sources. It can also play a valuable role in preventing erosion on hillsides.Fescues, blue grama grass, and buffalo grass use less water than most other turfs., Surround the oasis zones or lawn areas with plants that fall in the middle of the spectrum in terms of water, sunlight needs, and visibility. One way to do this is to create a ""cascade"" effect from the oasis plants (tall and bright) to the transition zone (a little shorter, catching attention by texture rather than color, such as shrubs, bushes, or ornamental grass clumps) to the arid zone (low-lying, subtle and very drought-resistant). If there is a retaining wall, however, a transition zone may not be necessary. Ultimately, see what looks best to you.

, These areas are exposed to many hours of sunlight, have dry soil, or are located in out-of-the-way areas where few people see them. The lowest maintenance plants will go here. These are often native plants and/or drought-resistant plants that require little watering, if any. There are several approaches here, and you may decide to use both in your yard:


You may plant larger arid zone plants include cacti, succulents, and drought-resistant shrubs. This is most common in desert areas, where water is so scarce that the oases may not add enough color or variety by themselves.
You may plant low lawn substitutes instead to cover a large area with a low-water ""carpet"" of plants. This can include native prairie, a clover lawn, or clumps of ornamental grass surrounded by mulch.
For expansive arid areas, you might make an exception and plant a taller or brighter focal point, such as a raised flowerbed or tree. A decorative structure such as a statue or wheelbarrow filled with a clump of flowers can enhance the aesthetics while requiring less watering than other options.

, Choose an appropriate mulch to help reduce erosion and suppress weeds. Organic, wood-based mulch will also retain moisture. As it decomposes, it will improve the soil over time, but it needs to be replaced regularly. A stone or gravel mulch, on the other hand, does not need to be replaced, but can retain a good deal of heat in sunny areas, which can damage delicate plants.Whichever mulch you choose, apply it to a thickness of 2-4 inches (5–10 centimeters) around shrubs, trees, and flower beds. Do not put it in direct contact with plant stems.Avoid plastic mulch and other mulch that does not allow water and air to pass through., Develop a water thrifty drip irrigation system if necessary to minimize evaporation and run-off. If using a sprinkler system instead, use low volume emitters, preferably with a rain sensor that automatically switches the sprinkler off on rainy days, If you're watering by hand or using a timed watering system, water deeply and infrequently to encourage the development of deep roots that can make use of water in the soil. Always water between 6pm and 10am, to minimize loss from evaporation., Slow-release fertilizers are less effort for the gardener, and reduce the chance of over-fertilization.If you apply fertilizer in too large a quantity, you might be encouraging tall, straggly growth that root development cannot keep up with, making the plant more resource-intensive.


Use organic composts and topdressing mulches as well.

, Regular maintenance is a core value of xeriscaping plans. Check on your garden often, and you'll be able to address problems before they get out of hand. Here are some basic tips to keep your garden attractive and maximize its water use:Remove weeds by hand before they get established.
Reduce water and fertilizer if your plants have weak, straggly growth.
When mowing your lawn, remove no more than 1/3 of the grass height, and use a sharp mower blade."

Increase the inner temperature of the cooling devices. 7°C (45°F) is enough for the fridge and -18°C (0°F) is enough for the freezer.
Keep the cooling devices tidy; label the items in the freezer, so that you can get to the food as quick as possible. It's not working efficiently whenever the door is open so standing there with the door wide open digging for the cholchlate-fudge sundaes isn't a good idea.
Fill unused space with padding such as polystyrene, newspaper or just a blanket.
Keep the doors of these devices closed.
Check the sealing gasket of the cooling devices: Put a switched on torch (or flashlight) in the fridge and close the door. Can you see the light? Check if the sealing gasket is damaged, and buy a new one if necessary.
Act energy efficient. Let food cool down before you put it in a cooling device and slowly defrost food from frozen food in the fridge.
Defrost the freezer if there's a layer of ice.

,
Paint your rooms in a bright color. More light is reflected by brighter walls and so you need less light to make your room bright.
Replace regular light bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs. It is economical to replace a light bulb if it burns for more than half an hour a day. Use high quality L.E.D. - Light Emitting Diode (Best type) or C.F.L - compact fluorescent bulbs.
Don't use ceiling floodlights, unless they are L.E.D. types.
Install and use dimmer switches at less than full brightness for incandescent lamps and other types (CFL, LED, etc.) that are specifically labeled as suitable for use with a dimmer.

, Use pots with a diameter that is as small as possible. Put these pots only on hobs that fit to them or are smaller. Try to use a pressure cooker if you're cooking for a considerable time. Check that the bottom of the pot is even. Keep the pots closed as long as possible. Without a lid you'll loose about 2/3 of the energy.
Reduce the amount of water you use while cooking.
Turn the stove off 5 minutes before you reach the cooking time.
Choose a gas stove, if practical, or an induction cooker if you buy a new stove.
Boil water with an electric kettle instead of the stove.

,
Bake with circulating air.
Use the oven several times if it's already hot.
Keep the oven's door closed as long as possible.
If the oven has already reached the final temperature turn it off 10 minutes before the food is ready.
Use a toaster or the microwave if possible instead of the oven.

,
Make the devices as full as possible.
Reduce the water temperature and use energy and/or water saving modes.

, You need 3 times more energy per degree to cool a room than to heat a room.


Ventilate during the night or early in the morning in order to store the coolness for the day.
Keep the coolness in the house during the day. Close the shutters and keep your windows and doors closed.
Use a fan instead of an air conditioner.

, While electric heat is the most efficient, it is often the most costly. If you use another energy source (natural gas, propane or heating oil) you can save money on electricity.

, Dry your wet clothes on a laundry line. If you are unable to follow this step because you don't have access to a clothesline, fill the dryer reasonably full, but not so full that air cannot circulate, and use the mode ""iron-dry"".

, Modern PCs can be set up to enter energy saving modes from both the BIOS settings page and directly from the Windows Operating system. Enable ""Sleep"" and ""Hybrid Sleep"" for desktops and ""Hibernation"" for notebook PCs running Windows.

, You will want to have these on hand so you can see how much you are saving.

, LED and CFL bulbs use a lot less electricity and last a long time, several times longer than incandescent bulbs. They do cost more than regular bulbs so you probably don't want to change them all at once. The high purchase price is compensated by their long life and low energy consumption. Your local utility may offer reduced price or even free CFLs from time to time. Check with them before purchasing. See warnings for important information on fluorescent light bulbs and their safe disposal.

, A 100 watt light bulb used 6 hours per day will cost in excess of $25 per year (.12 / kWh rate). If you can get by with a 40 watt light bulb, that cost will be about $10. Imagine if you did that to every light bulb in the house.

, Use the above costs to determine how much you can save. Remember to count the total number of bulbs as many light fixtures will have 2 or more light bulbs.

, You can easily waste hundreds of dollars a year leaving these on when not being used.

, Most homes have programmable thermostats and if you don't have one, it would be well worth it to buy one. There is no reason to heat or cool your house when everybody is at work or school. Many homes are empty for 8 or more hours a day and there is no reason to have the house at the same temperature that you want it when you are home.

, You can get a tube of caulk for a couple dollars. If you seal up all those cracks around the windows that let the outside air in, you can realize substantial savings.

, Cold water can be used for laundry, washing hands, dishes and almost all other everyday uses.


Taking a very short shower isn't really hard to do. First, flip up the tub lever so that it will hold water. Then, turn the shower on warm and wet down for about 5 - 10 seconds. Turn water off. There will now be a small puddle in the tub. Use a bath brush or washcloth to lather up by using the puddle of water in the tub. When lathered up good, shampoo hair last. Doing this last prevents the shampoo from dripping down into your eyes while you're lathering up. Then, flip the tub lever so the water can drain out and then turn the shower on warm for about 15 - 20 seconds to rinse off. All done! You have now saved water and saved on your power bill.

, Check the resources section for more information.

, Sometimes, you will want to compare your bill to the previous month to get a good comparison. Sometimes, you will want to compare to the same month the previous year.

Using 200mm x 75mm sleepers, cut 6 lengths 2700mm long and 6 lengths 1500mm long.



 


Pre-paint the sleeper to minimise leeching of the chemical treatment.






Set the first string of sleepers 100mm into the soil using a 2700mm length on each side and 1500mm length on each end.






Join them using 2 x 125mm bugle head galvanised wood screws at each corner. Make sure they are level with a gauge.






Their external measurement should be 2700mm x 1650mm.






Repeat this for levels 2 and 3 of the wall so that the total depth is 600mm.






Tie the three levels together in each corner using 50mm x 50mm slotted galvanised angle and 30mm button headed galvanised wood screws.





;
,


Dig down to the bottom of the wall and rake the soil to remove any sharp objects.
Lay an 1800 mm x 3750 mm piece of heavy duty shade cloth in the bottom of the bed so that it covers the soil and all horizontal and vertical angled joints.
This is to protect the plastic liner from damage during installation.


,

Place these plastic liners in the bed one at a time making sure the corners are not folded too tightly.






Take great care to avoid potential damage and leaks when the tank is filled with water.







,

Lay a 50mm slotted irrigation pipe around the inside perimeter of the bed to provide rapid distribution of water in the tank when it is being filled.






Cut the filler tube (700mm long), vertical overflow tube (about 230mm long) and horizontal overflow tube (150mm) from a length of 40mm rigid PVC tube.






Using 3 way couplers, join them into the distribution pipe.






Secure the filler pipe to the bed wall using galvanised saddle clamps and 30mm button head galvanised wood screws (above the overflow point).






Drill a 50mm hole through the bed wall just above the 250mm depth of the water tank.






Fit a 90 deg angle rigid PVC tube to the top of the overflow tube, and then connect the last piece of tube to the other end of the angle. Push this tube though the bed wall to provide an overflow route out of the bed.







,


Cut down a 40mm PVC cap to form a sleeve.
Put a small piece of UV protected plastic mesh Inside the sleeve, covering the open end of the overflow pipe.
The filter will keep insect pests out of the water tank.


,


Use crushed volcanic rock (20mm screenings) as a wicking medium.
The rock should be just submerged when the tank water starts to overflow.
Make sure the rocks are level with the water.


,


The shade cloth should extend about 100 mm up the sides of the bed.
Fill the rest of the bed up to 50 mm from the top with good quality garden soil with plenty of organic matter worked into it.
The shade cloth works by preventing soil from getting into the water tank, while at the same time allowing water to wick upwards out of the tank and into the soil.
Water wicks up to 300 mm from the surface of the water in the tank, maintaining ideal soil conditions for vegetables to grow.


,


Cut a piece of 230mm x 6mm x 750mm long fibro cement sheet and a 200mm long piece of 200mm x 75mm treated timber sleeper.
Paint the treated sleeper.
Fix the piece of sleeper to the top string of sleepers in the middle of the end wall near the filler tube using 2 x 125mm galvanised bugle head timber screws.
Use a piece of 50mm x 50mm galvanised angle bracket to secure one end of the fibre cement board to the adjacent side of the bed 200mm from the end wall.
Secure the other end to the end of the sleeper stub sticking out from the end wall.
Use galvanised M6 nuts and bolts to secure the board to the angle bracket and 30mm galvanised button head wood screws for the other fixings.
There is about 100mm of soil under the worm farm on top of the water tank for the worms to migrate to and from the growing area of the bed.

Composting worms are used in the worm farm because they tend to stay where the food is.
The earthworms are much more mobile, taking food from the worm farm and distributing it widely in their tunnels throughout the bed.


Use a thick layer of mulch and a small sheet of heavy duty shade cloth over the worm farm to provide protection from too much light and from predators.
Well maintained wicking worm beds use very little water and fertiliser and the soil's uniformly moist conditions rich in bio-activity is an ideal environment for vigorous and healthy plant growth.


,


For rapid results, chop suitable kitchen and garden waste in an old food processor. Avoid citrus and onion family waste and meat scraps.
This well-chopped mix is easily digested by worms and soil microbes and provides very rapid decomposition.

,


Cut a 750 mm long piece of 6 mm Tasmanian oak dowel (or equivalent) and glue a table tennis ball to one end using a blob of silicone.
Paint the assembly with hard-wearing line marking paint, and with black painted rings showing the full and empty levels in the tank.
The indicator slides up and down the filler pipe as the water level rises and falls.
Make a guide for the indicator with a 40mm PVC cap and an 7mm hole drilled in the centre.
As well as guiding the level indicator as it slides up and down in the filler pipe, this cap keeps pests (snails, mosquitoes etc) out of the water tank.


,


Cut the frame timbers from 42mm x 19mm untreated plantation pine.
Cut 2 x 2700 mm lengths, 5 x 1610 mm lengths and 10 x 700 mm lengths.
The 700 mm lengths control the height of the frame, and can be made longer for tall plants.
Paint the frame timbers with water based acrylic paint.


,


Fit the vertical supports on top of the 2700 mm long top sleepers of the bed at 664.5 mm centres flush with their outer face. Use 50 mm x 50 mm x 40 mm galvanised steel angles and 30 mm galvanised button head wood screws to secure them.
Add a short piece of galvanised steel builders strapping to each corner securing with 30 mm galvanised button head wood screws as shown in the photograph. Use a light hammer to flatten any sharp edges.
This strapping helps stabilise the structure.


,


Use 2 x 2700mm lengths and 2 x 1610mm lengths of the painted timber.
Clamp each corner (one at a time). Pre-drill for 2 screws and countersink. Screw the corners together using 60mm x 8g galvanised CSK wood screws.

Mark the 2 x 2700 mm longitudinals at 9.5 mm from one end, and then at 670 mm spacings along their length. These are the centres at which the 1610 mm infill rails must be fixed.
Clamp each joint (one at a time). Pre-drill for 2 screws and countersink. Screw the joints together using 40 mm x 10 g galvanised CSK wood screws.

,


Clamp one of the centre joints. Pre-drill for 2 screws and countersink. Screw the joint together using 60mm x 8g galvanised CSK wood screws.
Note that 2 sets of screws are used in this joint at 90 degrees to each other. Take care to leave adequate space for them to pass without getting to close to each other.
Finish the rest of the joints in the same way, but not the corners.
The corner joints are complex, and there is only room for one screw in each corner to hold the top frame in place. So repeat the above procedure in the corners but for only one screw in each. (See above photo of top corner joint.)


,


Cut a piece of heavy duty shade cloth 2700 mm long x 900 mm wide.
Fit 9 x 12.5 mm brass plated steel eyelets along each of the 2700 mm sides evenly spaced and centred 30 mm in from the edge.
Eyelets and eyelet swaging tools are usually available from good hardware stores.

Start at the top left corner of the south side of the bed (north side in the northern hemisphere). Screw a 25mm Galvanised Tek screw into the frame 20mm in from the top and left side of the bed.
Leave 10mm of Tek screw thread exposed so that 2 eyelets can be accommodated on the ""hook"".
Repeat the process in the top right hand corner of the frame, but gently stretch the fabric horizontally before locating the Tek Screw, so that the material is not loose on the hooks.
Repeat the process for the bottom corners, this time gently stretching the fabric vertically before locating the Tek screws in the top sleeper of the bed wall.
Screw the rest of the Tek screws in place making sure the fabric is kept taut.

Repeat the whole process for the north side of the bed (south side in the northern hemisphere), but use lighter 21% shading bird and insect netting (VegNet).
Cut a larger piece of the lighter netting 4500mm long x 1750mm wide. This netting covers the top and ends of the frame, and overlaps the other netting. It should be applied last and uses the hooks already in place for the side netting.
Drape the netting over top and ends of the frame making sure the overlap is even between opposite sides of the net. Hook the netting over the Tek screws ensuring it is evenly stretched all round, and mark the places where the eyelets need to be attached.
Remove the netting and fix eyelets at the points marked.
Install the pest exclusion netting sides first, then top and ends.
You will find that some of the Tek screw ""hooks"" only accommodate one eyelet and not 2. You can screw these hooks in a bit further so that only 5mm of Tek screw thread is exposed.


,


Apply a band of self adhesive copper tape continuously around the base of the bed 300mm up from the ground.
This measure is a very effective humane way of deterring these voracious mollusks.

Make sure that your refrigerator has a few inches of space behind it so air can circulate around the condenser coils.,
Dusty condenser coils cause your refrigerator to work harder, leading to higher bills, and a shorter life for the fridge.,

Is your refrigerator full?,
Make sure your fridge gasket is clean and does not have any holes or cracks in it.,
Wash clothes in cold water if possible.,
Is the lint screen on your dryer clean?,

Set the fan on your central air conditioner to “on”, rather than “auto”.,
Maintain your central air conditioner by cleaning the compressor with a garden hose.",How to Save Energy With Your Appliances," The appliance that uses the most energy is the refrigerator.;
, Clean them with a vacuum, duster, or a cleaner every three months to ensure it is running efficiently. If you have pets clean it every month. You can find vacuum attachments, dusters, and cleaner at AP Wagner's website.

, Having it too cold can be a waste of energy. It is recommended that the temperature for the refrigerator is 37 to 40 °F (3 to 4 °C), and that the freezer is 0 to 5 °F (−18 to −15 °C).

, A fuller fridge ensures the temperature is evenly distributed. If you have a lot of room in your refrigerator, fill some containers with water, and fill in the space. If that doesn't work, consider a smaller fridge.

, The gasket's job is to keep the cold air in and the warm air out. If it is not working properly the refrigerator will work harder keeping the air cold, and thus lead to a larger energy bill.

, Most of the energy used for machine-washing clothes goes to heating the water.

, A clogged lint screen makes the dryer use more energy. In addition to that it can also become a fire hazard.

, This will reduce warm-up and drying times.

, Doing this will circulate the air constantly, leading to a more evenly distributed temperature throughout the house.

, Make sure the power-flow is off before you do this.

Measure precipitation.,
Water the lawn enough to keep the grass alive.,
Minimize traffic on your lawn.,

Thoroughly water the lawn to ""wake it up."",
Fill in any bare spots.",How to Save Water with a Sleeping Lawn," Most grasses commonly used in lawns can withstand periods of dormancy quite well, but some are better than others. Buffalo grass, zoysia grass, fine-leaf fescues, tall fescues, and older, ""common"" varieties of Kentucky bluegrass (in that order) are the most tolerant of drought stress. Perennial ryegrass and newer, ""improved"" varieties of bluegrass require more water to keep the dormant plants alive. The more drought-tolerant your grass, the longer it will stay green without watering, and the less you'll have to water it to keep it alive while it's dormant.;
, Newly sodded or seeded lawns should not be allowed to go dormant, as they are not well enough established to survive drought conditions. In addition, grass with excessive thatch buildup, grass that has been damaged by insects or disease, or lawns in poor soil generally do not tolerate drought-induced dormancy well. In all these cases, you should water your lawn regularly to keep it green.

, When the grass is still green and growing in the spring, mow with a sharp blade set at a height of 3"" to 3-1/2"" (7.6 - 8.9 cm). Allowing your grass to grow relatively high like this will increase its drought tolerance. As a result, the lawn will stay green longer before going dormant.

, In areas with mild winters, grass may be green all winter long, while in other areas it will come out of winter dormancy and green up with increasing spring temperatures and rainfall. As long as there is adequate rainfall, your grass will stay green without you having to water it. When precipitation decreases and/or temperatures increase, the lawn will turn brown and go dormant unless you water it. At this point, you can stop watering at any time to allow the grass to go to sleep. Once you stop watering, you can generally allow the more drought-tolerant varieties above to go up to 4-6 weeks without water before you need to water again. Rye grass and newer varieties of bluegrass generally shouldn't go more than two weeks without water.

, Dormancy is the grass plant's natural response to survive periods of inadequate water. If the dormant lawn goes several weeks or a month without water, though, it typically will not recover, even when thoroughly watered later. The exact amount of water you will need to give your sleeping lawn needs depends on the temperatures, the humidity, and the amount of precipitation it receives naturally, but as a rule of thumb you should apply at least 1/2"" (1,27 cm) of water after the initial 4-6 weeks of drought. You should then apply at least 1/2"" (1,27 cm) of water every 2-3 weeks thereafter for as long as drought continues. If your summers are particularly hot and dry, as they are in the desert areas of the southwest U.S., for example, most grasses will require more water than this to survive. Buffalo grass and zoysia grass, however, generally require less water than bluegrass and fescue, and rye grass requires up to twice as much. Note that these waterings are only intended to keep the underground portions of the plant alive, and you typically won't notice any greening of the lawn above ground.

, Get or make a rain gauge to determine how much precipitation your lawn is getting, and keep track of this precipitation. Don't rely on your local weather reports, because these may not accurately measure the amount of rain that actually fell on your lawn.

, While you should make sure your sleeping lawn gets at least 1/2"" (1,27 cm) of water every 2-3 weeks (as stated above), this doesn't necessarily mean you have to water it that much. If your lawn is already receiving that much rainfall (as measured by your rain gauge), you don't have to water the grass at all. You only need to water enough to make up for any difference between your lawn's needs and the natural precipitation it receives.

, Dormant grass is already stressed, and heavy foot or vehicle traffic may kill the grass and cause bare spots in the lawn. If traffic is unavoidable on a certain area, water it regularly to keep the grass green and healthy.

, While the lawn sleeps, native weeds may still be wide awake. It's best to follow a system of integrated pest management (IPM) to control weeds in any lawn. If you're concerned specifically about weeds in your dormant lawn, simply pull the weeds, making sure to get the roots out. Dormant lawns do not tolerate herbicides well.

, If the lawn has been kept healthy throughout dormancy, it should begin to green up with the advent of cooler temperatures and more precipitation. To jump start the process, water the lawn thoroughly when the extreme heat of summer has passed, applying enough water to penetrate the root zone 6-12"" (15 - 30.5 cm) below ground. After 2-6 weeks of cooler temperatures and adequate precipitation, the lawn will be lush and green again. With a little help, this can sometimes be sped up - perennial ryegrass has been known to go from completely dormant to green in 4 days with thorough irrigation.

, As long as the dormant grass is sufficiently watered and properly maintained, the lawn will often make a full recovery when it comes out of dormancy (see the Tips section below for more information). If, however, you notice bare spots or thin patches in the fall, simply apply a light covering of compost and reseed the grass in those areas.

Consider the amount of rainfall.,
Consider the space of your niche.,
Consider all storage requirements the item must have.,
Understand the requirements for it's catchment area.",How to Buy a Right Rainwater Tank for Your Home," An ideal way to save water for your home is to have a rainwater tank. Rainwater tanks are used to store and recycle the rainwater which is received by your home or property. Generally the rainwater received by your land is wasted. Therefore, to beat water restrictions, rainwater tanks were introduced. Water is used in daily routine, for washing clothes, gardening, cooking food etc. Water is very essential for us. We are incomplete without water. To complete our daily tasks, we need water. Water scarcity is a factor that is able to interrupt our daily routine. Rainwater tanks are solution for such problem. Rainwater tanks collect the rainwater for you to be used in toilets, gardening and cleaning purpose. Using these tanks reduce water bills and saves money for you. Buying rainwater tanks bring many benefits to your home like reducing water bill and much more.;
, These factors that should be thought about include the Amount of Rainfall your area obtains over a course of a certain amount of days, the space of the area you are able to fill, how much storage you'd like to get out of the tank, and even it's catchment area.

, It is a major factor that needs to be considered while selecting a water tank. If the place where you live receives a good amount of rainfall every time, then buying a large rainwater tank is not necessary. Buying a large sized water tank is necessary for those areas where rain is not regular.

, Another thing you should know is the space where the water tank will be installed. If you have a large space to install the tank, then you can purchase round rainwater tanks for your home. But, if you do not have sufficient space to install round water tank, then choose slimline rainwater tanks that are ideal for small niches. This is the best solution, when you do not have enough space to install large tanks.

, You should also be able to know your basic requirements. You should think for what you will use rainwater. Will you use it for just gardening during drought or for washing and cleaning your home, attires and flushing the toilets? If your requirements are high, then you need to buy a large water tank for your home.

, You also need to calculate the catchment area. Generally a catchment area is roof that receives the rainwater. Measuring this area will help you to determine the right size of water tank for your home. These factors should be noted while you are planning to buy a rainwater tank for your home. Through this you will be able to determine the right water tank for your home.

Keep an eye out for animal tracks or trails, especially ones leading downhill.

, Dense vegetation and most trees cannot survive without a steady water source.


If you are unfamiliar with local vegetation, aim for the greenest plants you can see. Deciduous and wide-leafed trees are typically a better sign than pine trees, as they tend to require more water.If you can identify local plants, see below for species to look for.
In North America, look for cottonwoods, willows, sycamores, hackberry, salt cedar, arrow weed, and cattails.In Australia, look for desert kurrajong, needle-bush, desert oak, or water bush. Keep an eye out for mallee eucalypts, or eucalypts that grow with multiple stems emerging outward from the same underground tuber., Your best bet is a canyon that stays shaded during the hot afternoon, upstream of the mouth. This means a north-facing canyon if you are in the Northern Hemisphere, or a south-facing canyon in the Southern Hemisphere. Find these with a topographical map if you have one, or eyeball the surrounding landscape.Snow or rainfall is more likely to be retained in these cooler canyons, sometimes for months after a major rainstorm.

, Sometimes you can find water just under the surface. The best place to look is at a bend in the river, on the outside edge. The flowing water may have eroded this area down, creating a depression that catches the last dregs of water., Groundwater tends to collect at the dividing lines of a landscape, at the foot of mountains or large rock outcrops. Ideally, dig where a hard, impenetrable rock slopes beneath the surface.Softer stone such as sandstone can develop pockets that hold water for a while after a rainstorm. If it's rained fairly recently, search along level expanses of these stones, or at the top of boulders and isolated domed outcrops., If you're near the ocean, the sand dunes along the beach may trap and filter the seawater. Digging above the high tide mark may reveal a thin layer of fresh water, sitting on top of heavier saltwater., A hike to the high ground gives you the best vantage point to look for the features mentioned above.Try this as a last resort, since the exercise will dehydrate you — and you likely won't find water at the top of a hill.


When the sun is low in the sky, look for the glare of a reflection on the ground. This may be a body of water. If you are in an area used for cattle, you may see artificial water collection features at the base of gently sloping ground.Carry a pair of binoculars with you anytime you are out in the desert. This can help you spot areas where you might find water from a distance.

, Once you've reached an area that seems promising, take a look around for surface bodies of water. In most cases, you won't be this lucky, and will have to dig instead. Here are the best places to do so:


At the base of sloping rock features.
Near dense vegetation pockets, especially where bulges and cracks may indicate tree roots.
Anywhere the surface soil feels damp, or at least more clay-like than sandy.At the lowest point in the area.

, Digging during the afternoon is risky, since you'll lose sweat to exposure. If you can afford to wait, stay in the shade until the temperature starts to come down.


Groundwater tends to be closest to the surface in the early morning, especially in areas with vegetation., Dig a narrow hole about 1 ft (30 cm) deep. If the ground is still dry, move on to a different spot. If you notice damp soil, move on to the next step.

, Expand the hole until it is about 1 ft (30 cm) in diameter.You may notice water seeping in from the sides, but finish digging even if you don't.

, Return to your hole after a few hours, or at the end of the day. If there was water in the soil, it should collect at the base of your hole.

, If the water is difficult to reach, soak it up with a cloth and squeeze it into a container. Collect all the water right away, using makeshift containers if necessary. Water holes can empty fast in the desert.

, Whenever possible, purify the water before drinking it. Boiling the water, using iodine tablets, or pouring it through an anti-microbial filter will remove almost all biological contaminants.


Infections from contaminated water may cause vomiting or diarrhea, which dehydrate you rapidly. However, these infections often take a few days or weeks to cause serious symptoms. Drink the water now if you're in an emergency situation, and visit the doctor when you're back in civilization.

, Look for dew drops on vegetation before dawn. To gather it, pass an absorbent cloth over the dew, then squeeze it into a container.If you don't have absorbent cloth, form a clump of grass into a ball and use that instead.

, Decaying or dead trees may contain water inside the trunk. To reach into small holes, tie a cloth around a stick and fit it through the hole to absorb water.Insects entering a hole in the tree may be a sign of water.

, Rocks slow evaporation, so dew or rainwater may linger around them a little longer. Turn over half-buried stones in the desert just before dawn and dew may form on their surface. (This works because the base of the stone is cooler than the surrounding air.)


Check for scorpions and other animals before reaching underneath rocks.

, These juicy fruits are safe to eat and contain enough moisture to supplement other sources. Collect the fruit carefully to avoid injury, then roast them in a fire for 30–60 seconds to burn off the spines and hairs.You can eat prickly pear cactus pads as well. They are best when gathered young in the spring, then cooked. During other seasons they may be tough and hard to eat., In Australian deserts, the mallee eucalyptus is a traditional source of water, though it can be difficult to access for an untrained person. Each eucalyptus looks like a grove of small to medium trees, growing outward from a single underground plant. If you see a eucalyptus that matches this description, try to get its water as follows:Dig out a root where you see a bulge or crack in the ground, or look for them at about 6.5 – 10 ft (2–3 meters) from the tree. The most promising roots are about as thick as a man's wrist.
Pull out the length of the root, breaking it off near the trunk.
Break the root into pieces 1.5–3 ft (50–100 cm) long.
Stand the roots on end in a container to drain.
Look for additional roots. There are usually 4-8 near the surface around each mallee eucalyptus.

, Most barrel cacti are poisonous. Drinking the liquid inside them can cause vomiting, pain, or even temporary paralysis. Only one type of barrel cactus contains drinkable water, and even that is a last resort. Here's how to access it:The only safe barrel cactus is the fishhook barrel cactus, located only in the southwest US and northwest Mexico. It's usually about 2 ft (0.6 m) in diameter, with long spines that end in a curve or hook. It may have red or yellow flowers at the top, or yellow fruit. It grows in drainages and on gravelly slopes.
Cut off the top of the cactus with a machete, tire iron or other tool.
Mash the white, watermelon-like interior into a pulp and squeeze out the liquid.
Minimize the amount you drink. Even this fairly safe option tastes bitter and contains oxalic acid, which can cause kidney problems or bone pain.

, Shake the plant to reduce possible contaminants, then tie a plastic bag around it, sealing it shut around the stem. Weigh down the closed end of the bag with a rock to form a collection point for water to flow. Return at the end of the day to see if water has collected, due to the plant releasing vapor., If you have run out of options, you may need to search for fluid in plants you can't identify. Follow these precautions whenever possible:Test only one part of the plant at a time. Leaves, stem, roots, buds, and flowers may have different effects. Select a piece that produces fluid when you break it.
Rule out plants with strong or acidic odors if you have other options.
Do not eat for eight hours before the test.
Touch the plant to the inside of your wrist or elbow to test for a reaction.

Attach the spigot.,
Make an overflow valve.,
Connect the downspout elbow to the downspout.,

Connect the additional barrels.",How to Build a Rainwater Collection System," You can buy a water storage barrel online, but it's cheaper to get a used one from a company that uses large barrels to store food and other merchandise (just be sure to clean it thoroughly with soapy water). A rain barrel can also be made from a large plastic trash can. Get a barrel that will hold 30 to 55 gallons (113.6 to 208.2 L) of water.


If you decide to get a used barrel, make sure that it didn't formerly contain oil, pesticides, or any other type of toxic substance. It's too difficult to clean these chemicals from the inside of the barrel, so using them is too risky.
If you plan on collecting a lot of water, get two or three barrels. You'll be able to connect them so they're all part of the same water collection system, and this way you can have hundreds of gallons of water at your disposal.;
, The supplies you'll need to make your rainwater collection system can easily be picked up at a hardware or home and garden store. Figure out what you already have on hand, then gather the following supplies:


1 standard 1-inch hose spigot with ¾-in. pipe threads, so you can access water from your rain barrel.
1 ¾-inch x ¾-inch coupling
1 ¾-inch x ¾-inch bushing
1 ¾-inch pipe thread with a 1-inch hose adapter
1 ¾-inch lock nut
4 metal washers
1 roll Teflon thread tape
1 tube silicon caulk
1 “S”-shaped aluminum downspout elbow, to direct water from your downspout to your rain barrel
1 piece of aluminum window screen, to keep leaves, bugs and other materials out of your water
4-6 concrete blocks

, The downspout is the metal or plastic tube running from your roof's gutters to the ground. You're going to reroute the downspout directly into your rain barrel, so you'll need to prepare a platform in the area right next to it. Clear away any rocks and other debris from the area. If the ground there isn't flat, take a shovel and clear away enough dirt to flatten an area large enough to accommodate the number of barrels you have.If your downspout empties out onto a concrete driveway or patio that's situated on a hill, build a level surface by stacking a few plywood boards in the low section so you've got a level area on which to set the barrels.
If you have more than one downspout on your home, choose to place the barrels near the one that's closest to your garden, so the water you collect won't have as far to travel when it's time to use it.

, Dig a 5-inch deep rectangle in the area you leveled to accommodate the rain barrels, and fill it with 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of pea gravel.


Skip this if your downspout empties onto a concrete driveway or patio.

, Stack them sideways to create a raised platform for the rain barrel or barrels. The finished platform should be wide and long enough to hold all of your rain barrels level with each other, and steady enough that they won't tip over.

, It should be high enough up on the barrel to fit a bucket or water jug underneath. Make a 3








This is the standard size for a spigot; if you're using a different sized-spigot, make sure you drill the right sized hole so that it fits into the side of the barrel.

, Put caulk on both the inside and the outside of the barrel.








, Put the spigot and the coupling together. Use Teflon tape to wrap the threaded ends to create a tight seal and prevent leakage. Put a washer on the threaded end of the coupling and insert it through the hole in the barrel from the outside. Slip another washer over the pipe from the inside. Attach the bushing to hold the spigot in place.








Follow the directions for attaching the type of spigot you have. You may need to attach it differently than specified here., Drill a second hole a few inches from the top of the barrel. It should be 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm), or the same size as the first hole you drilled. Squeeze a circle of caulk around the hole, both inside and outside the barrel. Slip a washer on the hose adapter and put it through the hole from the outside. Put another washer on the inside threads, attach some Teflon tape, and attach a nut to tighten the assembly. You can attach a garden hose directly to the valve.


If you have a second barrel to use as an overflow barrel, you'll need to drill a third hold in the first barrel. Drill it at the same level as the spigot several inches to the side. Then drill a 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm)-hole in the second barrel at the same level as the hole you just drilled in the first one. Attach hose adapters to the holes in both barrels as described above.
If you're using a third overflow barrel, the second barrel will need a second hole so you can connect it to the third barrel. Make a second valve on the opposite side of the barrel at the same level. Make a valve in the third barrel as well.

, Figure out where to connect it by setting the barrel on the platform next to the downspout. It should be close enough to the downspout that you can connect it with the downspout elbow. Mark the downspout one inch below the height of the rain barrel. You'll need to attach the downspout elbow to the downspout so water will pour directly into the barrel. Use a hacksaw to cut the downspout at the mark. Fit the elbow to the downspout. Fasten it in place with screws, and make sure they're tight.









As your measuring and fitting the elbow to the downspout, make sure that the end of the elbow will dip well into the barrel so all the water gets collected there. You don't want the water to be pouring into the barrel from above.

, If the barrel has a lid, use the hacksaw to cut a hole large enough for the end of the elbow to fit inside. Cover the area around the hole with the metal screen.

, This will prevent leaves and other debris from running down the downspout and creating a clog in your rainwater collection system.

, If you have more barrels, set them on the platform and connect lengths of hose to the valves.

After most of the water has escaped, the barrel should be light enough to safely move. If the barrel is found to still be too heavy, acquire further assistance in moving the barrel throughout the remaining steps.;
, Separate the barrel from its original location, removing any gutters or funnels used to direct water. If any obstructions are present in any of the barrel’s openings, clear them away.

, Drain any remaining stagnant water from the barrel. Decaying material (such as leaves and dirt) will also flow out with the water. At this time, identifying if any animals are present in the barrel would be advised.

, Keeping the barrel on the ground, rinse the inside with water and remove decaying materials. Use a hooked coat hanger to pull out and dislodge sludge from the barrel openings. Upon finishing the removal of foreign material, dispose of the material into a designated yard waste receptacle.

, Within the five-gallon bucket, mix dish soap and water until suds are clearly visible. Fill bucket two-thirds of the way.

, Keeping the bottom end of the barrel up, sponge and clean off the outside of the container.

, Flip the barrel to its upright position. Using a flashlight, investigate the insides of the container. It will most likely still be very dirty with sludge and hardened sediment.

, Insert the broom head through one of the openings of the barrel. Allow it to fall to the bottom. If your barrel does not have an opening large enough for a broom head, instead stuff a sponge or mop head into the barrel and move it around with the broomstick.

, Screw the broomstick into the broom head inside of the barrel. Add the remaining cleaning solution into the barrel and scrub the inside thoroughly.

, Unscrew the broomstick from the broom head and remove the shaft. Dump the cleaning and dirt solution back into the five-gallon bucket. If the barrel is too heavy, acquire assistance to avoid self-harm. Once empty, feed the broom head out through one of the openings of the barrel. Dispose of the contents of the five-gallon bucket into a sink or proper wastewater manageable receptacle.

, If the barrel appears to be satisfactorily clean, leave it to dry.

, Inspect the outside of the barrel for holes or any damage that would allow leaks to occur. If found, prepare to patch the area.

, Using sandpaper (coarse grade preferred) roughen the area around the hole or crack. The scratches will create a greater surface area in which the patch and sealant will cure.

, Place the thin plastic sheet over the damaged area, and secure it with the adhesive drywall patch. Using a waterproofing sealant and plastic spatula, pad sealant around the patch.

, Store the barrel in a cool, dry place and allow sealant to cure (depending on the type of sealant used, this process will take between 6 to 24 hours).

, After cleaning and sealing of damage has completed, replace the barrel to its original location so that normal water collection may continue.

Work in a safe place.,
Observe laboratory dress codes.,
Obtain good-quality oil.,
Ensure all containers are well-labeled.",How to Make Bio Diesel1," This can mean in a clinical laboratory setting. You can find suitable laboratories at most colleges and research institutions. Working at home is also possible but requires caution - manufacturing your own biodiesel may be illegal and can put your house at risk of a fire, smoke or carbon monoxide.


A good work place will be well-ventilated and have clear access to running water, eye-wash stations, fire extinguishers, spill containment supplies, a fire alarm and a telephone to use in case of emergencies.;
, Most laboratories will have posted dress instructions you should follow. You should always wear a long-sleeve shirt, long pants, and shoes in any laboratory setting.


When making biodiesel, you should also wear a heavy-duty apron, chemical-resistant gloves (butyl rubber is best when handling methanol and lye) and protective goggles or eyewear.The gloves should come up to your elbows or have cuffs you can pull over your long-sleeve shirt.

, The easiest oils to use for biodiesel are neutral vegetable oils like canola, corn, and sunflower oil - these oils are readily available at grocery stores and have a low melting point, which means they won't solidify if they get too cold.


Avoid using peanut oil, coconut oil, palm oil, tallow, and lard. These sources of oil solidify at relatively high temperatures. Biodiesel usually has a lower melting point than the oil it's made from, but these oils can still be difficult for beginners.
Also avoid olive oil. It, peanut oil, palm oil, tallow, and lard all contain more acids than in the recommended neutral oils. These extra acids can interfere with the reactions that take place to create the biodiesel.
It's also possible to use waste vegetable oil which has been used for cooking. However, waste oil should be filtered to remove particulates, then allowed to settle for 24 hours to separate the oil from any water or other impurities. Pure oil will be clear and bright, with no sediment., Only use containers for making biodiesel - don't use them for storing food afterwards, even if you wash them well.

"

Add 200 ml methanol to glass blender or mixer.,
Add 3.5 grams (0.02 oz) of lye.,
Allow the lye to completely dissolve in the methanol.,
Heat 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of vegetable oil to 130° F (55° C) Add the hot oil to the mixture.,
Pour the mixture into a wide-mouthed glass container or pitcher.,
Allow the mixture to sit for several hours.,
Dispose of the glycerin properly.",How to Make Bio Diesel2," Take care not to splash or spill. Set the blender or mixer to ""low.""

, Try to weigh the lye quickly, as it absorbs moisture from the air. For this reason, be sure tightly seal the container you got the lye from.


The ensuing reaction between the methanol and lye produces sodium methoxide. Sodium methoxide cannot be allowed to sit for long, as it degrades in the presence of moisture.

, The process should take about two minutes. Proceed when mixture is clear, with no undissolved particles.


Again, be attentive - the sodium methoxide will degrade rapidly, so proceed to the next step as soon as the lye is completely dissolved.

, Allow the new mixture to blend for about 20-30 minutes.


As the reaction proceeds, two products are formed - biodiesel and glycerin.

, Allow the mixture to sit.


The mixture should separate into two layers - biodiesel and glycerin. Because biodiesel is less dense than glycerin, it should float, forming the top layer.

, When it has separated completely, carefully keep the top layer to use as your biodiesel fuel.


Separate the top layer from the bottom by pouring it off very carefully or using a baster or pump.

, Check with local waste disposal authorities to see whether glycerin can be thrown out with your normal garbage - it usually can.


If you don't want to waste your glycerin, consider pouring it on a compost heap to increase the rate of decomposition or using it to make soap. Consult our wikiHow on Making Glycerin Soap for more information.

Most wind turbines perform best at speeds from 12 to 20 mph (19 to 32 kph). To find the annual average wind speed for your area, you can check online wind maps that list the average wind speed in your area.You can also purchase a wind measuring tool, called an anemometer, and use it take the wind speed at the location of your planned turbine. Do this daily for a period of time.
If the wind speed in your area is fairly consistent, a month of readings should be more than enough, though seasonal changes can drastically affect wind speed. Then, average your readings to see if a turbine at your location is reasonable.;
, Building code changes from area to area, so you'll have to inquire with your local government to make sure your turbine you don't violate code. Some codes stipulate a minimum distance between turbines, as well as how far away the turbine has to be from the property line. There may also be height limitations imposed by local ordinances that you'll need to take into account when building.


It's also a good idea to discuss building a wind turbine with your neighbors before investing too much time in planning and construction. This way, you can address their concerns about wind turbines and resolve any misconceptions they may have about noise, radio interference, and TV reception., Although the turbine itself doesn't require much space, to avoid potential conflicts with neighbors, you should generally have at least half an acre (0.2 hectare) of space for a turbine that generates up to 3 kilowatts of power and a full acre (0.4 hectare) for a turbine that generates up to 10 kilowatts. You should also have enough vertical space to build the turbine high enough so that buildings and trees don't block the wind., The kind of blades you use and configuration of your blades may affect the design of your turbine. Old farm windmills were basically small sails attached to a rotating shaft, but wind turbines resemble giant propellers and have large teardrop-shaped blades. These blades should be sized and pitched correctly for the turbine to work efficiently.


If you choose to build the blades, you can make them out of wood or cross-sections of PVC pipe. Instructions can be found online through a general Internet search for ""DIY wind turbine blades.""
Whether you build or buy the blades, you'll likely want to have 3 blades on your wind turbine. Using an even number of blades, such as 2 or 4, makes a wind turbine more likely to vibrate as it spins. Adding more blades increases torque but can makes the turbine rotate more slowly.
Blades can also be made from household products, like modified shovels. If you plan on going this route, choose a sturdy shovel, and you may want to replace wooden handles with something more durable, like a metal haft., Your wind turbine needs to be connected to a generator to produce electricity. Most generators are direct current (DC), which means that to use one to provide household current you'll need to connect the generator to a power inverter to produce the alternating current (AC) that household appliances use.


You could use an AC motor as a generator, although there may not be sufficient residual magnetism to produce a strong enough electric field.
A generator relies on motion, in this case the movement of your blades, and magnetic force to generate electricity. A pre-made generator will be the easiest option for beginners, but tutorials can be found to make your own by searching the internet for ""making a wind turbine generator.""
If you decide to buy a DC generator, look for one rated for high voltage and current and low rotation speed (several hundred instead of several thousand revolutions per minute). You need to generate at least 12 volts over a consistent period of time.
Your generator should be connected to a deep-cycle battery bank and charge controller in between the generator and inverter to protect the inverter and battery from power spikes. This will also provide power to the inverter during low-wind periods.
Automotive alternators are not recommended as generators. These generally need to spin at much faster speeds than wind turbines can sustain to generate power., You may need to weld your spindle to your spindle plate, but many wind turbine kits come with this part already welded. If you are constructing your turbine from parts you have purchased or from surplus parts and need to weld, be sure you wear proper safety gear, like a welding visor, welding gauntlets, a welding jacket, and work boots.









By putting together your spindle first, you can construct your turbine piece by piece by adding parts one at a time to it. This will likely be the most efficient way to put together your turbine if you are attempting this project on your own., To prevent a buildup of friction and deterioration of your spindle/hub, you should place a bearing between the two parts. Fit your bearing over the tapered end of your spindle sticking up from the spindle plate and slide it toward the plate until it comes to a rest at the thicker portion of the spindle. Then slide your hub into place to rest on the bearing so that the studs of your hub face upward.









There should be a clearance of about 4"" (10.2 cm) between your spindle and the bearing. In high force winds, your turbine may flex, causing the blades to his, and damage, your spindle.
If you don't have a kit and are building your hub from scratch, you might consider using a 4 on 4 trailer hub. This can be bought at most stores that carry trailer supplies, like your local automotive parts store., The flange should have holes for the studs of your hub to slide through, with protruding tabs to which you'll attach each of your spokes. Line up your flange with the studs of your hub and maneuver it into place. Once your flange is resting evenly on your hub, fasten it into place with lug nuts, tightening the nuts first by hand and then more firmly with a socket wrench.







, You will have two sets of spokes per blade of your turbine, giving you a total of six spokes for a three bladed turbine. You'll need bolts to connect your spokes to the tabs of your lower flange and spacers to separate the lower spokes from the upper ones. Then:









Slide a bolt through a hole in one of the flange tabs, fit your spoke onto the bolt, apply the spacer to the bolt, fit your second spoke into place on the bolt, and sandwich the spokes and spacer into place with your upper flange. Your lower and upper flange should be the same shape, with the same number of spoke attachment tabs.
Screw the bolt into the upper flange with your hand to keep the flange in place, then fasten the other bolts for your first set of spokes. Repeat this process for all of your spokes.
Once all your spokes are sandwiched between your lower and upper flanges, you should use a socket wrench to tighten your bolts. Once the bolts are tightened, your lower and upper flange and spokes should be sturdy and able to spin easily along with the hub on your bearing.
Since your turbine assembly will be exposed to consistent force from the wind and other environmental factors, you'll want your bolts to connect your spokes firmly. To guarantee a good connection, you should use a thread locking compound, which will be available at most hardware stores., These studs should be threaded and each stud should be 23/8"" (6 cm) long and ¼"" (.635 cm) thick. You may need to use a hack saw to cut a threaded rod with this thickness to the correct length. Then, screw your studs in place by hand into the top of your upper flange so that each screw is equally distributed around the spindle shaft.









Only screw the studs into the flange far enough so that each stud is upright and sturdy. All studs should stick out of the flange an equal distance.
If you use a hacksaw to cut a threaded metal rod, be careful not to damage the threading when you do so. Damaged threading could result in you not being able to fasten parts into place correctly.
You'll want these studs to be sturdily attached, much like the bolts you used for your spokes. To this end, you should use a thread locking compound on your studs., You can either make your upper and lower magnet rotors with a rotor plates, epoxy, and 2"" by 1"" by ½"" neodymium magnets, or you can buy this part prefabricated as part of a wind turbine kit or from a wind turbine part manufacturer. With the magnets facing up, fit the bottom plate of your magnet rotor onto the four studs you have fastened to your flange.









Whether you make your own or use a kit-made magnet rotor, always be careful when handling individual magnets or the magnet rotor plates. The magnetic forces of these are very strong, and can cause serious injury if not handled with caution.
Neodymium magnets are fairly brittle. You'll need 24 of these, 12 for your top magnet rotor and 12 for the bottom one, but you might want to purchase extra in case one breaks during construction of your plate. These magnets are available for purchase online., If you are using a kit that came with a magnet rotor plate, you will only need to fit the plate onto the studs as described previously. For a homemade magnet rotor, you'll want your magnets equally distributed around the edge of your rotor. To prevent misplacing a magnet and potentially ruining your rotor, draw a magnet placement template on card stock or paper.

Your template will occupy the middle of your rotor where the magnets will not be. Lines extending from the center to the edges of your template will indicate where magnets should be placed on the rotor. Tape can be used to hold your template in place and example templates can be found online.
You should mark the polarity of your magnets before you begin placement. This can be done with a marker. If your magnets get jumbled together and you cannot tell the polarity, make a tester by gluing a weak magnet to a popsicle stick.
Pass the ""N"" polarity side of your tester over the neodymium magnet. If you feel a push, the magnet is the same polarity. If you feel a pull, the polarity of the magnet you are testing is opposite.
Use a pea sized amount of epoxy when mounting your magnets. This should be applied to the bottom of each magnet before placing.
Being careful to keep your fingers from between the magnet and rotor, slowly move the magnet to corner of the rotor plate. The magnet should grab onto the plate, and then you can slide it into the correct position using your template., You can use 3/8"" (.375 cm) metal tubing cut into 1¼"" (3.175 cm) long segments to create your spaces. You should cut these as accurately as you can. Slide your spacers over the studs sticking up from your magnet rotor.









Spacers that are unequal in length could create a slanted position for your upper magnet disk. This could be dangerous, and could also negatively impact the efficiency of your turbine.
There should be a little over an inch (2.5 cm) of stud clearance above your spacers. This will allow hex nuts to fasten your upper magnet rotor, and all parts in between, together., A stator is a series of coiled wires that are a vital part of any generator.It can be bought as part of a wind turbine kit, from a wind turbine part manufacturer, or can be made on your own.The studs surrounding the central spindle shaft should stick up through the center of the stator, which should be centered with respect to the central spindle shaft.









Your stator will need three groupings of three coils of 24 gauge copper wire, with each coil having 320 windings of the copper wire. This can be time consuming and difficult to make.
If you decide to make your own stator, an online search for ""how to make a wind turbine stator"" will walk you through the process.

, You can construct a stator winder from scrap wood and nails. Connect two pieces of plywood with four nails so that there is a gap of about 1"" (2.5 cm) between the two pieces of wood. Your nails should be spaced in a rectangular pattern that corresponds to the dimensions of your magnets. Then you can more easily wind the copper wire for your stator.

When making your own stator, be sure to keep track of the beginning and ending of your stator coils. Each coil must be wound in the same direction. You might want to consider putting a colored piece of electrical tape on the beginning of each end every coil.
So that your coils don't unwind once you've finished, you should be taped together with electrical tape and secured with two-part epoxy. Allow your epoxy (and stator) to cure on wax paper for however long is indicated on your epoxy label., Use extreme caution; this is one of the most dangerous parts of the construction of your wind turbine. Stack four boards on your stator to either side of your central spindle, with the base boards being thicker and your top boards thinner. 2 by 4 boards work well for upper boards.









Hold your upper magnet rotor so that your fingers are in the gap between your stacked boards, and slowly lower your upper rotor toward the lower one. Attempt to line up your upper rotor with the studs as you do so.
The magnetic field should grab the upper disk and pull it onto the boards you have placed. Then, lower the upper magnet rotor onto the studs by sliding out your boards one at at time. First remove one upper board, then the other.
Repeat this process with your lower boards to maneuver your upper magnet rotor into place. Then screw hex nuts onto your studs to fasten the rotor. Once this is complete, your upper rotor should be resting on the spacers with a small amount of the studs protruding from the top of it.
You may have to wiggle your boards back and forth to work each free of the upper magnet rotor. The magnetic force will be very powerful., Next you will be connecting your spindle to your tower. Doing so while your turbine assembly is attached to the spindle can be quite difficult to manage. Then you'll need to invert your assembly hub-upwards to complete your turbine.









Pull the assembly (including the hub, spokes, magnet rotors, stator, and all associated parts) off the spindle with an upwards motion. Then place your assembly on your work area, hub-side facing up.

, If you have a kit, these parts were likely provided, but a metal plate attached to the top of a thick, sturdy metal pipe should suffice for your tower. Be sure that your pipe can withstand the forces the wind will be exerting on your wind turbine.









Your tower will need to be installed at a sturdy location. You might want to pour a concrete slab into which you install your tower to give it additional stability., The bracket should fit over your spindle like a collar. You should then bolt the bracket into place, attaching the bracket to the tower. Then cut a 3/8"" (.375 cm) threaded rod into four 4½"" pieces. Use a thread locking compound first, and then use nuts and washers to attach these to the outside of your bracket facing upwards.









Nuts should be placed on the 3/8"" (.375 cm) threaded rod studs about ¾ of the way from the top of the rod. These nuts will allow you to adjust the position of your stator while the rod holds it in place., Before you do so, you should smear a liberal amount of general purpose bearing grease onto your bearing. After greasing, simply slide your tapered bearing onto the spindle so it rests at the base of your spindle.









The greasing process is most easily done with your fingers. Have some paper towel or a work rag close by to wipe your fingers clean once the bearing is greased and placed.

, Lift the main assembly so that the hub is facing upwards and settle it onto the spindle with the tapered bearing beneath. The mounting holes in your stator should line up with the 3/8"" threaded rod studs that you fastened to your bracket.









Once the assembly is in place, you'll need to put another tapered bearing into the cap of your hub. Grease the bearing with general purpose bearing grease.
Atop your bearing you'll need to fasten a castle nut. The castle nut should be screwed into place with your fingers.
When you cannot turn the nut easily, unscrew it until the gap in the castle nut aligns with the hole in the shaft of your spindle. Slide a cotter pin in this hole and use pliers to bent the legs of the pin to lock the castle nut into place.

, Use one hex nut per rod to lock the stator firmly into place on your assembly. Then, using two wrenches, adjust the hex nuts sandwiching your stator until it is directly in between the magnet rotors.









Once your stator is positioned, all you need to do is add a grease cap to the top of your hub and your turbine is complete., Connecting the charge controller to the battery before connecting it to the wind turbine will prevent power spikes from forming. This, in turn, will prevent damage to your equipment., This wire will transfer power from the generator to the charge controller. From there the electricity will pass into a battery or circuit.


Your wire should be like that found in power cords, with two lengths of wire bound in similar insulation. You can use an old extension cord with the plugs removed, if you wish.

, Insert the wire into the tower and up to the turbine assembly. You may need to use a string line or fish tape to help you thread the wire through the tower. Then, connect the wires to your generator., Now that you have your generator tied in to a charge controller and through the base of your tower, you're ready to tie in the line from your turbine. Whenever tying in an external electrical source to your main home circuit, you should consult a professional electrician. Many areas required a licensed professional to handle this kind of wiring."

Buy clean energy using the green pricing method.,
Buy clean energy using the competitive electricity market method.,
Buy clean energy using renewable energy certificates.,
Learn about extra benefits from buying clean energy.,
Learn about the risks involved if you do NOT buy clean energy.",How to Buy Clean Energy,"


Green pricing is a service offered by some electricity companies that allows people to use clean energy for an additional fee or premium.
Because every electricity company is different, fees and premiums added to your bill will vary. Some companies may charge per unit of renewable capacity, while other companies may charge fixed monthly fees.;
,


The competitive, or green electricity market gives people the option to switch from their local electricity provider to a company of their choice that offers renewable, clean energy.
The electricity market offers a wide variety of different services and packages to choose from and is very similar to the process people experience when choosing a cell phone provider.

,


Renewable, or green energy certificates represent the environmental benefits that people receive when the more conventional energy elements are displaced; such as oil, gas, and coal.
When you buy renewable energy certificates, you are paying for the benefit of adding clean energy to your region and making an environmentally sound contribution.
Buying renewable energy certificates is an ideal option for people who do not have the option to use clean energy in their area, but want to see the development of additional clean energy projects.

,


Since burning coal causes acid rain, buying clean energy will reduce the usage of coal and will help slow global warming.
Because nuclear power is another large source of conventional electricity, buying clean energy will help prevent the generation of radioactive waste, which stores for several thousand years.

,


Conventional electricity generates sulfur dioxide, which not only contributes to acid rain but also produces tiny soot particles, which ultimately play a role in causing death by air pollution.
Conventional electricity causes emissions of carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming by causing more droughts and floods, disease, and severe weather in certain regions of the world.
Conventional electricity also causes emissions of nitrogen oxide which eventually combine with organic compounds in sunlight to make smog, which leads to numerous health problems that include heart failure and difficulty breathing.

Maintain and inspect your batteries.",How to Make Your Own Electricity," Solar panels are a common solution and have a lot of advantages. They work in most of the world, are a modular solution which can be expanded to suit your needs, and there are many well-tested products available.


In general, panels should have south facing direct exposure to the sun (north-facing in southern hemisphere, up-facing near equator). The angle measured from a spirit level should be your latitude (You can look that up in Google maps.) In overcast conditions you will only get a fraction (10-15%) of electricity as to sunshine.
Fixed mounts can be built onto their own structure (which may house batteries and charge controller beneath) or placed on an existing roof. They are easy to mount and to maintain if near the ground, and have no moving parts. Tracking mounts follow the sun and add efficiency(+50%) and longer battery life. These are mechanical contraptions that have a risk being damaged by high winds and have moving parts to eventually wear out. Since the early 2010s it can by less expensive simply adding a couple more panels to east and west to get the same harvest.
Just because a solar panel is rated at 100 watts doesn't mean it will deliver that much on a regular basis, on contrary, higher temperature and any angle the sun not being 90 degrees over the panels will conspire to give less electricity (calculate with 70% of rated performance to be safe);
, Get just one or two solar panels to start off with. It's possible to install in stages, so you don't bite the huge cost all at once. Many grid-attached rooftop systems can be expanded—this is something to check when you shop. Buy a system that can grow as your needs grow.

, Like anything else, if you don't take care of it, it will fall apart. Saving a little money now can cost you much more later. Invest in taking care of your system, and it will take care of you.


Try to work out and budget for expenses related to keeping the system going in the long-run. Running out of funds in the middle of a project is a situation you want to avoid.

, If you have the choice, consider whether you want a stand-alone power solution or a grid-connected system. A stand alone power system is the ultimate in sustainability; you will know the source of every watt you use. A grid-connected solution gives you stability and redundancy, and can also provide an opportunity to sell power back to the utility company. If you are grid-connected, but manage your power usage as if you were stand-alone, you can even generate a little extra income, but be aware of political risks of cuts to these subsidies.


Contact your current utility provider and ask them about grid-connected systems. They may be able to provide incentives and will be able to tell you who to hire to set up your sustainable power supply.

, These are solutions in many locations especially in very overcast and windy climates. There it can be more cost-effective than solar power.


You can use a DIY wind turbine made from an old car alternator, with plans available on the net. This is not recommended for beginners but can achieve suitable results. There are also fairly inexpensive commercial solutions. One option, a ghost wind turbine, is made of clear plastic which makes it less conspicuous.
There are some drawbacks to wind power as well. You may need to put turbines very high in the air for them to work effectively, and your neighbors may see them as an eyesore. Birds may not see them at all...until it's too late (just joking).
Wind power needs fairly consistent wind. Open, desolate areas work best as they have the fewest things blocking the wind. Wind power is often used effectively to supplement a solar or hydro system.

, There are various types of micro-hydro technologies available, ranging from a homemade propeller connected to a car alternator to fairly robust and intricately engineered systems. If you are on a riverfront property, this could be an efficient and self-contained solution.

, You can always combine any of these systems, to help ensure that you get power year round and that you get enough power for your home.

, If there is no grid, or you want disaster/blackout backup or you run workshop machinery, a generator may be required.


Many generators are very slow to react to load changes,which make them unusable for washing machines (switching on a power-hungry device an cause the power to falter).

Small, commonly available generators at your hardware store are made for occasional emergency use. They will quickly fail if used for daily power.


Large household generators cost a significant amount of money. They can run off gasoline, diesel or LPG, and usually have a self-starting mode where they kick on when the grid power is interrupted. If installing one, make sure you work with a licensed electrician and follow all building codes or be very smart.
Generators made for RV, trailer, or marine use are small, quiet, made for continuous duty, and are much more affordable. They can run off gasoline, diesel or LPG, and are made to run on demand for hours at a time for a period of years.
Cogeneration or Combined Heat and Power systems (CHP) produce power and heat simultaneously. This is only good for you if you have use for that heat, even in summer.







, There are many different vendors offering different products and services in the green energy marketplace and some of these solutions will fit your needs better than others.

, If you're interested in a specific product, do price comparisons on the net before you talk to a vendor.

, Find someone you trust to help you make decisions. There are vendors who have your best interests at heart and there are vendors who do not. Find DIY and similar communities online to get advice that isn't coming from someone who wants to sell you something.

, Remember to ask about local, state and federal incentive programs when you make your purchases. There are many programs in place that will subsidize the cost of your installation or give you significant tax breaks for going green.

, Not every contractor or handyman is equally qualified to install these systems. Only work with experienced vendors and installation specialists who are licensed to work with your given equipment.

, Your current homeowner's policy might not cover it if a disaster wrecks it, and that could be heartbreaking.

, If you get in over your head, don't hesitate to get help.

, The natural elements that a self contained power system use on are not reliable. The sun is not always shining, the wind is not always blowing, and the water is not always flowing.


Using a grid-connected system is the least expensive solution for most people, especially those who are already power customers, but energy companies do pollute the planet considerably. If forced, they install one sort of power (such as solar), and tie the package to the grid. When there isn't enough power coming in, the grid makes up the shortfalls, and when there is excess power, the grid buys it. Oversized systems can consistently run the power meter backwards.
If there is no power service nearby, it can be much more expensive to get connected to the grid (or even to connect an outbuilding to the house) than to make and store your own power, this is even more true from the mid 2010s on.

, A common solution for self-contained power storage is lead-acid deep cycle batteries. Each type of battery needs a bit different kind of charge cycle, so make sure your charge controller handles your type of battery, and is configured correctly for it.

, In older constructions, batteries can not be mixed and matched, and generally new batteries of the same type will not do well when mixed with older batteries. To mix batteries you need advice from university educated engineer.

, Storage capacity is rated in amp-hours. If you want roughly kilowatt hours multiply amp hours times the number of volts (12 or 24 volts), and divide by 1000. To get amp-hours from kilowatt-hours, just multiply by 1000 and divide by 12. If your daily use is going to be 1KWH, you'll need about 83 amp/hours of 12 volt storage, but then you need 5 times that (considering you never want to discharge past 20%), or about 400 amp-hours to deliver that amount of juice.

, There are many different kinds of batteries and it is important for you to choose which is best for you. Understanding what will work is not easy. Find a company which can prove it has been running a battery stack for longer than 5 better 10 years. Guesswork or sales pitch will give poor results


Wet cells are the most common. They need to be serviced (the tops come off so you can add distilled water), and they need an occasional 'equalize' charge to cook the sulfur off the plates and keep all of the cells in about the same condition. Some high quality wet cell batteries have independent 2.2 volt cells that can be replaced if they go bad. ""Maintenance free"" batteries will lose water as they gas off, and eventually cells will dry out.
Gel batteries are not serviceable, and unforgiving of charging problems. A charger designed for a wet cell will cook the gel off of the plates and form gaps between the electrolyte and the plates. Once one cell has managed to overcharge (due to uneven wear), the whole battery is bad. As part of a small solution, they work reasonably well, but don't work well in larger solutions.
Absorbed glass mat batteries are more expensive than either of the other types, and don't need service. As long as they are charged correctly, and not cycled too deeply they will last a long time, and they can't possibly leak or spill—even if you smash them with a hammer (though we're not sure why you would want to do that).They do still give off gas if excessively overcharged.
Car batteries are just that, for cars. Car batteries do not perform well in situations that call for deep cycle batteries.
Marine batteries are usually hybrid deep-cycle and starting batteries. As a compromise they work well in a boat, but not well for household power.

, Even with a generator, batteries are required in an off-grid system. Charging batteries will put a reasonable load on the generator so it works efficiently for the fuel it consumes, while simply running lights will put mostly light loads, which are very inefficiently handled by most generators.

, Batteries and their connections need routine inspection (even ""maintenance free"" batteries must be routinely inspected). This can be done by a professional but you can learn how to inspect them yourself as well.

Understand what solar energy is.,
Use solar energy if you live somewhere that receives a lot of sun.,
Visit a local place that stocks solar equipment.",How to Determine the Best Source of Green Energy1," Solar energy is about turning sunlight into energy we can use to heat and cool our houses, run appliances and vehicles, etc. It has become more viable and more cost effective to use in recent years, although more development continues to try to improve on both the amount of energy captured and the amount stored. Solar energy can be divided into the following:


Solar PV: This is the traditional solar panels. PV stands for photo-voltaic.
Concentrated PV: This uses lenses or curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto PV cells. It is more efficient.
Concentrated solar thermal: This uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight into heating a substance such as salt or liquids.;
, Solar energy is great for hot water systems in the average home and for garden lighting, and other things. The downside is that it won't be so effective when the amount of sun is low, and it doesn't work at night unless you have a way to store it.

, They will be able to show you the latest possibilities that use solar power and give you the estimated costs for installing it in your home.


Even if you only use solar energy for a few things on your property, this is a benefit that will save you money and emit less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. You'll be doing your part to minimize such emissions.

Consider the downsides.",How to Determine the Best Source of Green Energy2," This is about capturing the kinetic energy of wind to power mechanical devices. Humans have been doing this for as long as they've known how to make windmills and water wheels. Wind power is usually generated using turbines with blades nowadays and many power companies are able to sell electricity created from wind power to you.

, You could try contacting your local energy company and asking if it provides wind powered electricity as an option. If not, consider putting in a small wind turbine on your own property. You'll need to check local planning laws about the permissibility of adding such a structure to your property.

, Wind energy is unpredictable. If you have a long period of no wind, you won't get any power at all from this energy source. Always have an alternative power source that you can rely on, or team this up with another green energy source.

Understand what biofuels are.,
Find out about the source and sustainable management of biofuels you buy.",How to Determine the Best Source of Green Energy5," Biofuels are made from plants or biomass. It is considered green because it is renewable and does not create a net increase in carbon dioxide emissions (the amount it releases when burned is taken back up again by plants when they grow again). However, biofuels are considered controversial because they use plants that are also human food. If their use displaces crop growth, this can cause feeding problems for the world's growing population. Also, a lot of biofuels have been grown where forests once stood, at the expense of old growth and tropical forests, destroying biodiversity.


Another downside to biomass burning is that it is a source of indoor air pollution for many people around the world.

, If you aren't convinced about the source, don't use it and make a complaint to the company providing it. Don't rely on biofuels as your main source of future green energy; treat it as a transitional energy form that will help you move from fossil fuel use to other renewable forms of energy.


Some biofuels are made from waste plant matter, such as sugar crop waste. In this case, they're using something that would just be left to rot anyway. There are acceptable sources out there, just be knowledgeable about the source.

Carpool to the office, ride your bike, or take public transit.",How to Reduce Your Energy Consumption1," To conserve electricity, make sure all the lights in your office are turned off, including bathrooms, kitchen areas, and meeting rooms. You should also try to switch off lights in a room if you plan to be out of there for longer than a few minutes at a time.During the day, you can maximize natural daylight by using natural light instead of overhead or fluorescent lights. Switching off one fluorescent light for one hour a day can save 30 kg of carbon dioxide emissions a year.
You may also want to look at areas where there is excessive lighting or lights that are turned on in rooms that are barely used. Have these lights removed or suggest the lights are not used if daylight is enough. As well, you can suggest to your supervisor that light bulbs be switched to energy saving bulbs, such as LED bulbs, if possible.;
, You can conserve your heating use by setting the thermostat in the office at different temperatures in the winter and in the summer. In the winter, keep the thermostat at 68 degrees or less during the day and at 55 degrees at night when no one is in the office. In the summer, keeping thermostat at 78 degrees or more will also help to reduce energy use in the office.In the winter, it can also be useful to keep shades and blinds open in the office during a sunny day. This will heat the room naturally. You should then close the blinds at night to reduce the amount of heat lost via the windows. In the summer, keep shades and blinds closed to avoid overheating the room and when the air conditioner is in use.

, Many newer computers will have built in energy saving features that can reduce the amount of electricity used by your office. If you’ve been using the same desktop for 10 years, consider upgrading to a new version that has energy saving features. Not only will this promote energy savings, it will also show up as savings on the office’s electricity bill.You can also encourage everyone in the office to make sure their computers have the power down option set as well as the hibernation option set. Keep in mind screen savers do not save energy. In fact, they are energy wasters, as your computer has to provide twice as much energy to light up your computer screen when using a screen saver.
Remind everyone in the office to turn off their computers, as well as copiers and other electronic equipment when they’re done for the day or when they are not using them. Shutting off your computer will not shorten itself lifespan and can save high amounts of energy.

, GreenPower is a program offered by some energy providers to reduce your home or office’s carbon footprint in Australia, the United States, and Canada. GreenPower providers are part of a government accredited program to use clean, renewable electricity in homes and offices and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Your supervisor can contact your office’s energy company and ask them if they can provide GreenPower to the office to reduce the office’s energy consumption on a daily basis.

, You can cut down on your energy use by adjusting your daily commute. Carpooling with co workers will keep one more car off the road and reduce the amount of energy you use via fuel. Biking to work everyday also means you are using kinetic energy, not electric or fuel based energy, to get around.Public transit is also a great way to limit your energy consumption. Many city buses run on eco friendly fuel.

Embrace natural light.,
Change your bulbs.,
Turn off the lights.",How to Save Electricity1," Open up your curtains and let the sun shine in! Using natural light whenever possible instead of relying on artificial light can greatly reduce the amount of electricity you use during the day.The same is true whether you work in an office or spend your days in your house. Exposure to natural light also increases happiness,, giving you an even greater incentive to raise the blinds.


Try to arrange your workspace so that natural light floods your desk. Keep the overhead lights off when possible. When you need extra lighting, use a low-powered desk lamp instead.
Buy curtains or blinds in a light shade. They will still allow light to come through, but also provide privacy when you need it.;
, Replacing regular incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent (CFL) or LED bulbs is a big energy saver. Incandescent bulbs release 98% of their consumed energy through heat, while CFL and LED bulbs are much more energy efficient and last several times longer.CFL bulbs were the first alternative to incandescent bulbs, and they use only about 1/4 the energy of incandescent bulbs. They contain trace amounts of mercury, so they must be disposed of properly when they burn out.
LED bulbs are newer to the market. They're more expensive than CFLs, but they last longer and don't contain mercury.

, This is the simplest, most common way to save electricity, and it really works. Start paying attention to how many lights are on in your house at a given time. Be mindful of how many lights you really need to be using at once. When you leave a room, make a habit of turning off the lights, every single time.


Use light bulbs which don't need to ""warm up"" for areas that have lights which are used for short periods of time. This information should be written on the bulb's packaging.
If you really want to go all out, have your family use just one or two rooms at night, rather than spreading out all over the house and keeping your entire home lit.
For maximum electricity savings, use candles! This old-fashioned system of providing light at night is effective, romantic and peaceful. If you don't find it practical to use candles every night, try doing it just once or twice a week. Be careful doing this with little kids, though - make sure all of your family members know how to handle candles safely.

Upgrade your office equipment to energy saving models.,
Remind everyone in the office to turn off their electronics at the end of the day.,
Suggest switching to laptops and getting rid of desktops.,
Switch to green power in the office.",How to Save Energy in the Office1," Certain older models of computers, printers, copy machines, and other types of office equipment can use up to between 50 and 90 percent more energy than energy-efficient models. Look for office equipment with energy saving features, usually bearing the “Energy Star” logo. This certifies that the equipment is made to reduce energy usage.Energy Star certification can be found on computers, printers, copiers, refrigerators, televisions, windows, thermostats, and ceiling fans, as well as other appliances and equipment.;
, It’s important that everyone also power down electronics when they are not in use. Contrary to popular belief, shutting off your computer at the end of the day will not shorten its lifespan and can save a lot of energy.It can also help to use a power strip for each group of electronics in the office. You can then use the strip’s on/off button to turn off the power to all the appliances at once when they are not in use.
Remind everyone in the office to unplug ""vampire electronics"" once they are fully charged, like your cellphone or your laptop computer. Once your cellphone is fully charged, unplug the charger from the electrical outlet, as it will still draw in energy if it is left plugged in.
You can also encourage everyone in the office to make sure their computers have the power down option set as well as the hibernation option set. Screen savers do not save energy. In fact, they are considered energy wasters. Your computer must provide twice as much energy to light up your computer screen when the screensaver option is turned on as it normally does when your computer is running.

, If your office is considering a computer upgrade, suggest switching to laptops instead of desktops. Laptops use much less energy than desktop computers., You can also suggest that your office switch to green power for all electricity in the office. Green Power is a program offered by some energy providers that can reduce your office’s carbon footprint.GreenPower providers are part of a government-accredited program to offer clean, renewable electricity in offices in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Your supervisor can contact your office’s energy company and ask them if they offer GreenPower for the office to reduce the office’s energy consumption on a day to day basis.

Make a habit of turning off all lights and electronics in your home.,
Set your computer to sleep and avoid using screen savers.,
Use your household appliances efficiently.,
Ensure your home is draught proof.,
Adjust your thermostat based on the temperature outside.",How to Reduce Your Energy Consumption2," Institute a “switch off when done” policy for all computers, televisions, telephones, A/Cs, lights, and other electronics in your home. This can help you save hundreds of dollars in energy bills and reduce your household’s energy consumption.You should also unplug any seldomly used electronics or appliances, like a mini fridge in the basement or an old coffee grinder in your kitchen. As well, every time someone is done in a room, they should turn off the light. Make this a habit so it comes as second nature to your family.
Consider switching to LED bulbs for all lights. LED light bulbs are affordable and easy to find at your local hardware store. These light bulbs use up to 85 percent less energy than regular light bulbs and come in a variety of shapes and light levels.
If you have lots of electronics or appliances that require an electrical outlet, use a power strip. A power strip can help you control how many items are plugged in at once and you can switch off several items at a time easily on the power strip.

, If there are any computers at home, it is important that your computer is set to go to sleep after several minutes if it is not being used, and that you have the hibernate setting on your computer.Avoid using screen savers, as they are actually a big energy waster and can require more energy from your computer than sleep mode or hibernation mode.

, Look for the Energy Star label on appliances like desktops, laptops, printers, and scanners, which indicates that these appliances are energy efficient. As well, you should adjust your refrigerator, your oven, your dishwasher, your dryer, and your washing machine so they are energy saving and efficient.Adjust your refrigerator temperature to 38-42 degrees Fahrenheit and your freezer temperature to 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit. If your fridge has a power-save switch, make sure it is on, and always check that the door seals closed once you are done in the fridge.
Check that the seal on the oven door is intact and avoid peeking in the oven more than necessary, as this lets out heat and increases the cooking time. Use your microwave, rather than your oven, for reheating small items.
Avoid pre-washing your dishes before you put them in the dishwasher and only wash full loads in the dishwater to save water.
When you wash your clothes in a washing machine, wash in cold water as much as possible and always rinse the clothes in cold. Using cold water, instead of hot, can save you up to 50 cents a load. Today’s modern washers and detergents can clean clothes well in cold water and you should only use hot water for very dirty loads. You should also use the highest spin cycle when washing your clothes as the high spin speeds remove more moisture and reduce the time needed to dry clothing. If possible, invest in a front loading washer as they save more water and energy than top loading washers.
Reduce your energy consumption by always cleaning the lint out of the filter of the dryer and dry heavy and light fabrics separately. A clothesline, where your clothes can air dry, is actually the most energy-efficient way to dry your clothing.

, Having gaps or cracks in your walls or your windows can lead to drafts, which can let out cool air and lead to wasted energy use. Seal any gaps or cracks in your home so you can reduce your heating and cooling bill.Make sure your windows are draught proof and energy efficient, especially if you live in a colder climate.

, Conserve your heating use by setting the thermostat in your home at different temperatures in the winter and in the summer. In the winter, keep the thermostat at 68 degrees or less during the day and at 55 degrees at night when no one is in the office. In the summer, keeping thermostat at 78 degrees or more will also help to reduce the energy use in the office.In the winter, it can also be useful to keep shades and blinds open in the office during a sunny day. Doing this will help to heat the room naturally. You should then close the blinds at night to reduce the amount of heat lost via the windows. In the summer, keep shades and blinds closed to avoid overheating the room and when the air conditioner is in use.

Unplug any appliances that aren't in use.,
Replace old appliances with energy-saving models.,
Reduce your reliance on appliances.",How to Save Electricity2," Did you know that appliances that are plugged in keep using energy, even when they're switched off? Even an appliance as small as a coffee pot continues slowly sapping energy every moment it stays plugged in, long after the last cup of coffee has been consumed.


A power strip with a switch makes this easier. Instead of pulling 5 devices out of their sockets, all you have to do is flip a switch.
Power down your computer and unplug it at the end of the day. Computers use a lot of energy, and when they stay plugged in you're wasting both energy and money.Don't leave your TV plugged in all the time. It may seem inconvenient to unplug it when you're finished watching, but the savings are worth the trouble.
Unplug your sound system and speakers. These are some of the worst culprits when it comes to sapping extra energy when they aren't in use.
Don't forget small appliances such as phone chargers, kitchen appliances, hair dryers, and anything else you've got that runs on electricity.

, When older appliances were manufactured, companies weren't as concerned with saving electricity. Newer models are designed to conserve energy, reducing your household costs and lowering your carbon footprint. If you have an older refrigerator, electric stove and oven, dishwasher, washer and dryer, or other large appliance, look into getting it replaced.


Look for ""Energy Star"" ratings on new appliances. These help you assess how much energy the appliance uses. Many energy-conserving appliances are more expensive than those that don't have this feature, but you'll earn the money back over time through electricity savings.
If replacing your appliances isn't an option, there are still plenty of ways to change your routine so that you're using as little electricity as possible.

Fill the dishwasher up before running it, rather than running a smaller load.
Don't open the oven while it's in use, since you release heat and the oven has to use extra energy to produce more.
Don't stand at the refrigerator with the door open trying to decide what to eat. Open and close it as quickly as possible. You should also check the seals on your refrigerator and replace them when they get worn out.
Do full loads of laundry instead of small loads.



, In the old days people didn't need large appliances to run their households; experiment with ways to use only what you really need. Using fewer appliances can make some tasks more time-consuming, but if you get the whole family involved you won't be spending too much extra time on chores.


Most people wash their clothes more than necessary; try reducing the number of loads you do each week.
Hang a clothesline in the backyard and let your clothes line dry instead of using the dryer.
Wash your dishes by hand (using the water conservation method) instead of using the dishwasher.
Limit your baking to one day a week, during which you make several dishes within the same period of time. This way you won't have to heat the oven over and over.
Get rid of small appliances you don't really need, like plug-in air fresheners. Open the windows instead!

Insulate your home.,
Use less hot water.,
Use the air conditioner less frequently.,
Keep your home at a low temperature during the winter.",How to Save Electricity3," Making sure there are good seals on the doors and windows leads to huge savings in energy costs. Insulation keeps your home from leaking cool air-conditioned air during the summer and warm heated air during the winter.


Have a contractor inspect your home's insulation to determine whether it's efficient enough. Consider the attic, crawlspaces, basement, walls and ceiling. You may want to look into fitting your home with new insulation.
Weather-strip your home by using caulk and weather strip in your doorways, windows and around window air conditioners. You can also purchase plastic sheeting to put over the windows during the winter.

, Heating water takes a lot of energy. It's not necessary to take cold showers, but being mindful of how much hot water you use, and how the water is being heated, can save a lot of electricity and money.


Make sure your water heater is insulated so that it isn't losing too much heat.
Consider getting a water heater that doesn't run on a continuously lit pilot light.
Take showers instead of baths. Baths use a lot more water than showers.
Take shorter showers. Spending 20 minutes in the shower uses up a lot of electricity

, Sometimes it's unavoidable to use the air conditioner, but there's no reason to have it on from the beginning of spring to the end of the summer without ever turning it off. Find other ways to cool yourself down when possible.

, You save a lot of energy and money by keeping your home a few degrees lower than normal during the winter. If you get cold, put on a sweater instead of turning up the thermostat.

Use renewable energy.",How to Save Electricity4," Look into getting your energy from a company that uses renewable energy, such as wind or solar energy. Many companies that provide this service are small, so you may have to seek them out. The switch-over may be expensive at first, but you'll save money over time."

Use more natural lighting.,
Designate a few rooms as night hangout rooms for your family.,
Use candles instead of electric lights a few times a week.,
Rethink your outdoor lighting system.,
Use energy-efficient lightbulbs.",How to Save Electricity at Home1," Do you tend to keep the curtains and blinds closed and flip on the overhead lights? Letting your house flood with natural light instead can lead to big electricity savings.Unless you need strong, focused light to complete a particular task, try leaving the lights off during the day and embracing the sun's rays in the rooms you're using.


Try to set up your family's daytime work and play space in the brightest room in your house. That way everyone can read, work on art projects, use computers, and so on without relying on artificial lighting.
Use light-colored curtains and blinds as window coverings. Find coverings that provide privacy but still allow diffused light to flood your rooms.;
, Instead of spreading out all over the house, have your family spend evening hours in just one or two rooms. That way you won't have to light the whole house to enjoy the evening, plus you'll have the added bonus of spending quality time with each member of the family.

, You don't have to wait until a summer thunderstorm knocks out the power to break out the candles. Choose a night or two a week to leave the lights off and light your family's way with sturdy, slow-burning candles that cast a fair amount of light. Kids will find it exciting, and over time you'll save electricity and cash.


You can use the candlelit nights as an excuse to power down the rest of the house, too. Encourage family members to do activities that don't require electricity, such as reading by candlelight or telling fun or scary stories.
Be sure that your children know how to handle candles safely, and that the candles and matches are stored in a secure place when they aren't in use.

, Leaving a porch light or path lights burning all night long can waste a lot of electricity. Determine whether having lights on overnight is really necessary before flipping the switch in the evenings.


If you have lights around your house for security purposes, consider getting automatic security lights with motion detectors instead of using lights that stay on constantly.
Decorative lights that complement your garden or pathway can be replaced with solar-powered lights that charge during the day and cast a soft, pleasant glow at night.
If you use lights to decorate during the holidays, flip them off before going to bed, rather than leaving them on all night long.

, Replace all of your incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) or LED bulbs. Incandescent bulbs release most of their energy through heat, rather than light. Newer bulb styles are much more energy efficient, and they save a lot of electricity and money over time.


CFLs use only about 1/4 the energy of incandescent bulbs. They come in many shapes and styles. Be sure to dispose of these bulbs properly, since they contain small amounts of mercury.
LED bulbs are slightly more expensive than CFLs, but they last longer and don't contain mercury. LED bulbs are slightly more efficient than CFLs. If you like the ability to customize your environment, LED bulbs come in multicolor and dimmable variants. Some even give you the ability to choose a color using your cell phone!

Make sure all lights are turned off in your office at the end of the day.,
Install weather strips on doors and around windows.,
Modify the temperature in the office based on the season.",How to Save Energy in the Office2," To conserve electricity, create an office policy to ensure all the lights in your office are turned off, including lights in bathrooms, kitchen areas, and meeting rooms. You should also tell your employees to switch off lights in a room if they are going to be out of there for longer than a few minutes at a time.During the day, maximize natural daylight by using natural light instead of overhead or fluorescent lights. Turning off one fluorescent light for an hour a day can save 30 kg of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
Consider areas in the office where there is excessive lighting or lights that are turned on in rooms that are barely used. Remove these lights or suggest not using lights if daylight is enough. As well, switch the light bulbs to energy-saving bulbs, such as compact fluorescent (CFL) or LED bulbs, to save more energy.

, This will prevent air from escaping your office when the air conditioner or heater is running, which can be especially important for offices located in regions of the country that experience extreme temperatures.You can also prevent drafts in the office by keeping the front doors of the office closed and making sure the door shuts firmly behind someone as they leave so heat or air does not escape to the outside.
You should also clean and repair your office's heating, venting, and air conditioning (HVAC) system on a routine basis, or hire a repairman to come at least once a month. A clean and working HVAC system will help reduce your energy bills and make it easier for your office’s HVAC system to cool or heat your office.
Make sure all air vents are clear of paper, files, and other office supplies. Blocked air vents means your HVAC system has to work harder and use more energy to circulate cold or warm air in the office.

, Conserve your heat energy by setting the thermostat in the office at different temperatures in the winter and in the summer. In the winter, set the thermostat at 68 degrees or less during the day and at 55 degrees at night when no one is in the office. In the summer, setting the thermostat at 78 degrees or more will also help to reduce energy use in the office.During the winter, keep shades and blinds open in the office during a sunny day. This will heat the room naturally. Close the blinds at night to reduce the amount of heat lost via the windows. In the summer, keep shades and blinds closed to avoid overheating the room.
As well, after office hours and during weekends, energy can be saved by increasing the temperature of the thermostat during hot weather, and by lowering the temperature in cold weather.

Examine the dials.,
Read from left to right.Unless noted otherwise on the dial panel, read the dials one by one, moving from left to right.,
Select the lower number when in doubt.,
Look at the dial to the right to double-check the previous dial.",How to Read a Gas Meter1," Most dial meters have four or five separate dials. On the simplest meters, these dials are lined up straight in a row, but some meters may have them grouped together in a cluster.


Most meters have four dials, but a decent amount do have five.
Dial meters are older and more common than digital meters.
Note that adjacent dials spin in opposite directions. Usually, the first and third dials turns counter-clockwise while the second and fourth dials turn clockwise. When the meter has a fifth dial, that one also turns counter-clockwise.
You should ignore any red dials or any dials marked ""100 per rev."" Similarly, if one dial is notably larger than the rest in a cluster, do not take a reading from that dial.;
, The digit you should read is whichever digit the dial hand hovers over. Write down the digits side by side as you read them off.


When writing the reading down, line the numbers up directly in a row without separating them.
For instance, if the first dial reads ""2,"" the second reads ""5,"" the third reads ""7,"" and the fourth reads ""1,"" the correct meter reading for that meter would be ""2571.""

, If the dial hand rests between two digits, take the lower of the two digits.


For example, if the hand is between ""3"" and ""4"" on one of the dials, you should read that dial as ""3"" instead of ""4.""
When the dial hand is between ""9"" and ""0,"" however, you should read the dial as ""9"" instead of ""0."" Since the dial numbers range from ""0"" to ""9,"" the number ""0"" marks the beginning of another rotation while the ""9"" still belongs to the previous rotation, technically making it lower in value.
The dial hand must reach the tick mark of the next highest digit to be recorded as such. For instance, even if the hand is closer to ""5"" than it is to ""4,"" you must still record it as ""4"" since the hand has not passed the ""5"" tick mark.

, When the hand of one dial appears to rest precisely on top of one digit, check the dial to the right of it. If that hand of that second dial has passed the digit “0,” take the digit that the hand of your first dial appears to rest on.


Conversely, if the hand on the dial to the right is not past the ""0"" mark, you should use the number directly below the digit your left-hand dial hand seems to hover over.
For example, if the hand of the second dial appears to rest on the number “3,” look at the hand of the third dial. If that third dial is between “9” and “0,” you can read the second dial as “3.” If the hand of the third dial is positioned anywhere else, though, you should still read the second dial as “2” since the hand is likely resting just before the digit's tick mark instead of directly over it.

, There must be adequate ventilation. Take proper precautions, such as wearing gloves and protective eyewear. And use the same precautions listed on the labels of the ingredients, in addition to your common sense.

, Add one and a half teaspoons of lye.

,, Heat the oil to about 60ºC or 140ºF.

, Add the methanol/lye mixture.

,, Through a process called transesterification, you will see a dark layer of glycerin forming beneath the lighter layer of biodiesel fuel, as the trans-fatty acids in the oil are stripped of one molecule of glycerin, which is replaced with three molecules of alcohol.

, Over the next couple of days, you will see your biodiesel become clearer. This occurs as all the glycerin settles.

, This biodiesel fuel will work in almost any modern diesel engine. Ask your mechanic if you have any rubber hoses or gaskets, and have the mechanic replace them with synthetic. Biodiesel will dissolve natural rubber and that will end up clogging your filters. It has substantially reduced carbon emissions.

Unplug everything.,
Reduce your reliance on appliances.,
Replace your appliances with energy-efficient models.Manufacturers didn't used to pay much attention to how much energy their products used, but times have changed when it comes to the design of large appliances.",How to Save Electricity at Home2," Did you know that appliances and electronics continue sapping electricity as long as they're plugged in, even when their switches are turned off?Making a habit of unplugging these items when they aren't in use saves a lot of energy over time.


Power down your computer and unplug it when you aren't using it. Computers are one of the main culprits when it comes to using a lot of energy in a household, so unplugging them when you're finished checking your email for the night is worth the hassle.
Unplug your TVs, radios and sound systems. Leaving these plugged in day in and day out is a waste of electricity and money.
Don't forget smaller appliances like coffee makers, toasters, hair dryers and phone chargers. These use small amounts of energy, but it really adds up over time.

, What appliances do you really need to use on a daily basis? Think about your routine and determine where you might be able to save some energy. In some cases it might mean spending extra time on certain chores, but the reward is saving energy, money, and having the satisfaction that comes with being more self-sufficient. For example:


Dry your laundry on a clothesline outside instead of using the dryer. This saves a lot of energy, and many find the old-fashioned task of hanging clothes on the line to be among the more relaxing of chores.
Fill your dishwasher to the brim instead of doing a partially-empty load.You could also wash dishes by hand using a water conservation method rather than relying on the dishwasher to do the job.
Sweep instead of vacuuming. If you have carpets you'll still have to vacuum once in a while, but you can sweep up large crumbs and clots of dirt with a broom in between sessions. Pulling out the vacuum every day uses up a lot of energy.
Do all of your baking on the same day of the week. Heating the oven requires a lot of electricity (unless your oven is powered by gas), so it makes sense to heat it once and bake more than one thing, rather than spacing out your baking over the course of the week.
Reduce your reliance on small appliances, too. Let your hair air dry more often than you blow dry it, throw out that plug-in air freshener, and chop food by hand instead of using a food processor.

, Many are made to be more energy efficient, and some include settings that allow you to choose how much energy to use in a given cycle. Next time you need to replace a large appliance, do some research to find a model that doesn't use too much electricity. If purchasing appliances made and distributed in the United States, look for an ""Energy Star"" certification. This certification means the appliance was tested by the United States Department of Energy and it outperforms federal requirements for energy efficiency.

Use less hot water.Heating water requires a lot of electricity; the more hot water you use, the more your water heater has to produce to keep up.,
Insulate your house.,
Use the air conditioner sparingly.,
Keep your house at a lower temperature in the winter.",How to Save Electricity at Home3," Using less hot water on a daily basis is an important way to conserve energy. Start these new hot water-saving habits:


Wash your clothes with cold water. Unless you're doing a load of clothes that is caked in dirt, it's not necessary to use hot water to wash them; in fact, hot water wears your clothes out much faster.
Take showers instead of baths. Filling a bathtub requires gallons and gallons of hot water; taking a shower uses much less.
Take cooler showers. Do you really need to take a steaming hot shower every day? Try reducing the temperature just a bit every time until you get used to a lukewarm temperature. Save the hot showers for a special treat.
Insulate the water heater. Water heaters that aren't insulated waste energy that gets released from the heater instead of being used to heat the water. Make sure the one you have is insulated, or buy a new model that is designed to conserve energy.
Insulate the pipes in unheated and uninsulated areas of your home, such as the basement by fitting them with pipe sleeves. This is important in climates where winter temperatures can go below freezing because uninsulated pipes can freeze and burst, leading to costly repairs. Even if you don't have freezing winters, be sure to insulate at least the first 3 feet of water pipes (both the cold inflow and hot outflow) from your water heater to reduce heat loss. According to the United States Department of Energy, insulating your pipes with pipe sleeves can save up to $8-12 annually. , It's important to make sure your house isn't releasing too much air-conditioned air during the summer or heated air during the winter. If you have cracks in the frames of your windows, under your doors, in your houses basement or foundation, in the attic, or anywhere else in your home, you may be leaking electricity and money.


Have a contractor inspect your home to determine whether additional insulation may be needed.
Use caulk and door seals to seal the areas around your window and door frames. You can also buy plastic sheeting to cover your windows during the winter.

, It's tempting to keep the house nice and cool during the summer, but this comfort comes at great expense. Leave the air conditioner off for most of the day, and use it to cool down rooms only when the heat becomes uncomfortable. Use alternative strategies to cool yourself down whenever possible.


Take a cool shower during the heat of the afternoon.
Open the windows and let the breeze come in.
Drink plenty of water and eat ice cubes to keep cool.
Spend time outside near a lake, river or pool.

, You can save a lot of money by turning the thermostat a few degrees lower during the winter instead of heating your house until it's toasty. Set it just low enough so that you're still comfortable while wearing thick layers of clothing. Wear wool socks and sweaters to keep warm instead of relying on your home's heating system.

Cut a large opening (about half the top) in the top of the steel drum. You may also be able to find a drum with the top already removed.
Drill a 1.5-inch hole in the bottom of the drum. You will attach a pipe to it shortly.
Weld the 1.5-diameter pipe in the hole at the bottom of the drum.
Attach the 1.5-inch brass ball valve to the pipe. This is the drain valve. Brass is not necessary, but it offers the greatest durability.
Drill a hole in the side of the drum at the bottom, same size as the heater element. You can find heater elements in old hot water heaters or purchase them at a hardware store.
Fit the heater element properly, making sure it is not touching the side of the drum.
Wire up the heater element.

,


Attach one pulley to the rolled steel rod.
Attach the other pulley to the spindle of the electric motor.
Weld the propeller to the other end of the rolled steel rod. You can use cheap shelf brackets as propellers.
Attach the rod, pulley and propeller assembly to one side of the hinge. This will allow you to be able to move the propeller/mixer when necessary.
Weld a piece of angle iron across the top of the drum. This angle iron (or similar) offers support for the mixing apparatus.
Weld the unattached side of the hinge to the angle iron so the propeller and rod assembly sits in the middle of the drum. The hinge should swing the propeller and rod back and forth.
Mount the electric motor on the side of the drum. You should be able to mount the motor directly to the drum without it tipping the drum (unless your motor is from an old Cadillac or something).
Fit the belt to the pulleys and tighten by wedging a block of wood into the hinge. A tight belt is necessary to mix the biodiesel.

Convection ovens work better the more surface area the food has. That is, they will work better on cookies or muffins than banana bread.
You may need to reduce the baking time a little when using convection.

, Although microwave ovens use more energy than conventional ovens, the shorter cooking time saves energy.

, They let you reduce the oven temperature as much as 25 degrees (13.88 degrees C).

, Don't open the door to peek at the food, as opening the door reduces the temperature by up to 50 degrees (27 degrees C).

, For example, if you're roasting a chicken, you could also roast potatoes and vegetables alongside it. You might even be able to bake bread, biscuits, or dessert.,,,, If you use a large burner for a small pan, you waste electricity or gas. Turn the flame or coil down to the minimum setting for the heat you need to cook your food adequately. For example, smaller pots of water boil when the burner is set lower.

, The more water you use, the more energy is required to bring the water to a boil and keep it boiling.

, Pressure cookers, which are either stovetop or electric, raise the temperature of water before boiling and trap steam. Do a web search for pressure cooker recipes.

,, Preparing meals from the beginning uses more energy than reheating food.


Save energy by reheating food on the stove or in the microwave oven rather than a conventional oven.

,, This uses less energy than a stove or oven. Grilling outdoors also prevents heat from being released into your house, which may cause increased air conditioner use.

, Using a tea kettle decreases energy by about 1/3.

,, Don't wash under running water, especially not hot water.

, Dust and debris insulate the heat exchange process, and reduce your refrigerator's efficiency., Use a cover to prevent splatters. Messy microwaves heat less efficiently."

Look at the meter.,
Record the main digits from left to right.,
Ignore the other digits.",How to Read a Gas Meter2," Digital meters can display readings in either imperial or metric units. The unit of measurement might be marked on the meter panel, but if not, you can usually tell which unit of measurement you are dealing with based on the number of digit placeholders provided.An imperial meter measures your natural gas in cubic feet, so the display panel will usually have ft3 next to it. Imperial meters also have display panels with four digits to the left of the decimal point and two digits to the right of the decimal point.
A metric meter measures your natural gas in cubic meters, so you should see m3 next to the display panel. Metric meters also have five digits to the left of the decimal point and three digits to the right.
Note that digital meters are increasingly more common nowadays, but dial meters still tend to be more prevalent. Digital meters are most often found on newly built homes and are only used by certain natural gas providers.

, Read the digital meter panel from left to right, writing down the numbers exactly as you see them. Only worry about the main digits found on the main panel screen.


Main digits are easy to identify because they are either shown in black against a white background or shown in white against a black background.
When writing down the numbers for your reading, write then exactly as you see them without any separation.
For instance, if the main digits of your meter panel are ""3872,"" you should write the reading down as ""3872.""

, Depending on how complex your digital meter is, there could be a few smaller, secondary digits displayed elsewhere on the panel. You should ignore these digits when taking your gas meter reading.


Ignore any red digits or any digits printed inside of a red border.
You should also ignore any printed zeros and any numbers that follow a decimal point.
For example, if the meter shows ""9314.78,"" only record ""9314.""
Similarly, if the meter panel shows ""9314"" in black or white print, with ""78"" in red or outlined in red, only record the ""9314.""
If the meter panel shows something like ""9314"" in white with a ""0"" in black, only record the ""9314.""

Monitor your building's energy use for maximum efficiency.,
Maintain your building's steam trap system as needed.,
Optimize your Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system.,
Check the controls of all of the operating systems in your commercial building.,
Update your fixtures with the most advanced technology.,
Install high efficiency equipment to replace dated units.,
Audit your building regularly.",How to Reduce Energy Consumption in a Commercial Building," This means checking and updating your building's commercial energy consumption on a regular basis in order to ensure you are not wasting energy or using excessive energy. Keep these things in mind when assessing your commercial building energy use:


Adjusting your building's operational timing can make a big difference in your energy bill. For example, it is not necessary that you heat or cool your building to levels that are optimal to employee comfort during non-business hours. Therefore, you may want to reset your thermostat to save on electricity during off hours.






The energy efficient design measures that were incorporated into your building when it was first built may need updating.






You may utilize occupancy sensors that will turn off unnecessary systems in unoccupied areas.





;
, Many large commercial buildings use steam boilers for heat and have a network of hundreds of steam traps that are used to control the condensate. It is not unusual for a number of these stream traps to malfunction after a certain age, which means they are constantly releasing steam, causing the boiler to go into overtime and driving up the cost of your commercial energy consumption.

, Your HVAC system can account for up to 20 percent of your commercial building energy bill. Therefore, it is important that your building's boilers and/or chillers are checked regularly by a professional and maintained for optimal performance.

, Outdated technology, improper programming and malfunctioning control indicators could all contribute to providing an inaccurate account of how efficiently your building's operational equipment is running. You may need to replace, reprogram or upgrade your equipment controls to ensure your building's operational equipment is running most efficiently.

, Replacing old windows with energy efficient models, using new lighting fixtures and employing modern construction techniques to upgrade your building's efficiency can greatly reduce energy consumption.

, This applies to chillers, boilers, water handlers and air distributors.

, Have an energy consultant or specialist do a thorough assessment of your building's energy efficiency and make suggestions for how you may reduce energy consumption.

Access the roof space of your house and make sure that your roof has an insulation membrane under the roofing sheets.,Locate the top two purlins either side of the roof ridge

,
Now tidy up any excess insulation.,
When finished each side of the roof should now have insulation running from the gutter to the height of the top purlin.The space between the purlin should be open to the underside of the metal forming the ridge.

,
Cut strips of insulation wide enough to fix across the underside of the top two purlins and long enough to run the length of the ridge.

,
Fix this insulation to the underside of the top two purlins with your hand tacker, thus forming a header between them.,
Near the center of the ridge fit a suitably sized duct outlet.,
Fit a ceiling duct outlet to the ceiling of the area you wish to heat.

,
Fit a suitably sized ducted fan somewhere between the duct from the ridge and the duct to the ceiling.Best practice would entail suspending the fan from the roof structure using a heavy duty spring .,
Measure cut and fit two lengths of foil ducting.One to connect your ridge duct to the fan and one to connect the fan to the ceiling duct.

,
Fit a thermostatic switch near the duct at the header and position the sensor bulb inside the header near the duct opening.,
Wire the fan to the thermostatic switch so that the fan will only run when the temperature of the air in the header, exceeds the control temperature of the area to be heated.

,
Move to the outside of the roof and seal any air gaps between the ridge of the roof and the roof sheeting profile.,
Your heater is ready to use at this stage and it will contribute many hours of free heat during days where the sun shines despite the air temp being cold.

,
To really get most benefit the top meter or so of the ridge should be covered with a clear plastic cover.",How to Use Your Roof As a Solar Space Heater,";
,, Use a hand tacker staple gun to neatly secure the insulation to the purlins along the whole length of the ridge.

,,, The air between the roof sheeting and the insulation will be heated by the radiation of the sun.It will rise toward this header and collect there.

,( if you intend to use a six inch ducted fan then you should use a matching 6 inch duct) Fix it to the underside of the purlins. Seal to the foil using silicone or similar product , making sure that the portion of foil directly under outlet is removed to allow the heated air to flow from the duct.

,, This will prevent vibration from the fan if it becomes out of balance due to dust building up on its blades)and will insure quiet operation.

,, Secure the bulb to the purlin.

,,( you could use expanding foam or a proprietary profile seal.)

Call a professional.,
Investigate incentives.,
Install the solar panels.,
Connect the panels to an inverter.,
Install a disconnect.,
Install extra power meters.,
Connect the solar system to the grid.,
Consider adding batteries as back up.",How to Solar Power Your Home1," Grid tied systems are probably your best bet, especially if you live in an area with reliable power. By having a grid tied system, you are eligible for tax credits, plus you'll be able to sell your excess power back to your power company. However, in order to take advantages of these benefits, you'll have to have it installed by a licensed professional. While you may be excited to install the system yourself, it really is better to do it this way, as the high voltage associated with the systems can cause serious injury.;
, Make sure you look into all of the incentives open to you before you proceed. Certain states require particular types or brands of solar panels or the other equipment that makes up the system. There are also separate state vs federal benefits, so talk to your power company about all of the options available to you. Some power companies will even buy back your excess power.

, Once you're ready, install the solar panels. Choose the best type of panel for you and get enough of the to produce the amount of power you need. This is another area where a professional can be really helpful, as there is a lot of math involved in figuring out the necessary number of panels.

, If you live in an area where AC power is used, you'll need to connect your solar panels to an inverter, which converts the DC current created by the panels into useable AC power. You can get a single large inverter to which all the panels connect, or you can get micro inverters, which connect to each of the individual panels. The second is usually best if you have more than two or three panels, as you will be able to more easily find out where bad connections or downed panels are.

, Most states require grid tied systems to be connected to a DC or AC disconnect, which acts like a breaker box, separating the solar panels from the rest of the system. This makes it safer to do future repairs. Your hired professional will understand if this is necessary and what type is best for your system.

, Have your power company install any extra power meters that are necessary. This is likely, as your power company will want to measure your grid input, output, and off-grid use. Contact your power company for more information.

, Connect your inverter to the disconnect and then your disconnect to your main meter. This will cause you to feed electricity into the system, spinning your meter backwards. Create enough juice and you'll earn yourself a monthly or annual check from your power company.

, If you're worried about the main grid power going out, such as you live in a rural area or an area frequented by storms, you'll want to consider adding a bank of deep cycle batteries to your system. These would connect separately to your house and your solar panels, and store power in case of emergencies.


Install a charge controller if you do this. This will keep your batteries from becoming damaged due to overcharge.

Keep your vents open.,
Use fans strategically.,
Wash your laundry in cold water.,
Adjust your thermostat when you aren’t at home.,
Turn off surge protectors when not in use.",How to Reduce Your Home Energy Costs1," One of the easiest ways to reduce energy costs is to make sure all of your vents are open and unblocked. While many people believe a closed vent will save them money, the opposite is true. Closing the vent changes the temperature in that spot, but it makes the HVAC work that much harder to get the temperature consistent with the temperature on the thermostat.Make sure your intake vents have clean air filters. Blocked air filters force the HVAC to work harder to circulate air, which increases your power bills and shortens the life of your HVAC system.;
, The smart use of fans is a great way to cut down on your energy costs. Because hot air rises and cold air sinks, circulating the air homogenizes the air temperature in the room. Since that’s usually what your HVAC is doing, the use of fans allows the HVAC to rest more.Ceiling fans or freestanding fans both work for this. In the summer, the ceiling fans should be rotating counterclockwise, and the freestanding fans should be pointing toward the ceiling. In winter, reverse it.

, Up to 90% of your washing machine’s energy usage is attributable to heating water. About 13% of a home’s energy usage is attributable to heating water and another 13% is attributable to appliances, so this has the potential to cut down on both. You should also avoid overfilling your washer. While it doesn’t make much of a difference for the washer’s energy usage, a cramped drier has to stay on for longer, and that will require more energy.

, Simply adjusting your thermostat by about ten degrees for eight hours per day will cut your energy usage by about ten percent. Since you aren’t home anyway, those are ten degrees you shouldn’t miss.Some people are under the impression that the energy spent returning your home to the normal temperature will cancel out the savings from the ten degree adjustment. This is untrue. While it does have an effect, it isn’t a large enough effect to cancel out a workday’s worth of savings.
Another sneaky factor that might be raising your energy costs is a distortion in the temperature caused by placing heat sources next to thermostat. If you move heat sources like lamps and televisions away from the thermostat, it will get a more accurate reading of the temperature in your house.

, It’s a good idea to use surge protectors anyway, as they will save your electrical equipment from the kind of sudden surges in electricity that happen when lighting strikes. But by turning off surge protectors when not in use, you minimize the use of electricity (and production of heat) by large clumps of electronics. "

Soak the titanium-dioxide-coated plate, coated side down, in the dye for 10 minutes.

,
Clean the other plate with alcohol.,
Retest the cleaned plate to find its conductive side.,
Apply a thin carbon coating to the conductive side of the cleaned plate.,

Wipe excess solution off the exposed portions of the plates.

,
Attach an alligator clip to the exposed coated sections on either side of the solar cell.

,
Connect the black wire of the multimeter to the clip connected to the exposed titanium dioxide coating.,
Connect the red wire of the multimeter to the clip connected to the exposed carbon coating.,
Place the solar cell next to a light source, with the negative electrode facing the source.,
Measure the current and voltage generated by the solar cell with the multimeter.",How to Make Solar Cells," Plates of the size used as covers for microscope slides would be ideal.;
, Once the plates are cleaned, handle them only by the edges.

, Do this by touching the surfaces with the leads from a multimeter. Once you have established which side of each plate is the conductive side, place them side by side, one plate conductive side up and the other conductive side down.

, This will hold the plates in place for the next step.


Place the tape along either of the long side of the plates to overlap 1 millimeter (1/25 inch) of the edges.
Place tape over the outer 4 to 5 millimeters (1/5 inch) of the conductive side up plate.

, Put 2 drops on the conductive side up plate, then spread it evenly over the plate surface. Allow the titanium dioxide to cover the conductive-side-down plate.


Before applying the titanium dioxide solution, you may first want to coat the plates with tin oxide.

, Now you'll treat the 2 plates differently.


Place the conductive-side-up plate on an electric hot plate overnight to bake the titanium dioxide onto the plate.
Clean the titanium dioxide off the conductive-side-down plate and place it where it won't collect dirt.

, The dye can be made from raspberry, blackberry or pomegranate juice or by brewing a tea from red hibiscus petals.

,, Do this while the titanium dioxide-coated plate is soaking.

, Mark the side that doesn't conduct with a plus sign (+).

, You can do this by going over the conductive side with a pencil or by applying a graphite lubricant. Cover the entire surface.

, Rinse it twice, first with de-ionized water and then with alcohol. Blot dry after rinsing with a clean tissue.

, The plates should be slightly offset, about 5 millimeters (1/5 inch). Use binder clips on the long edges to hold them in place.

, Let the solution soak through the plate coatings so they're covered completely. You may want to open the binder clips and gently lift 1 of the plates up to allow the solution to spread over the entire surface.


The iodide solution will enable electrons to flow from the titanium-dioxide-coated plate to the carbon-coated plate when the cell is exposed to a light source. Such a solution is called an electrolyte.

,,, This plate is the solar cell's negative electrode, or cathode.

, This plate is the solar cell's positive electrode, or anode. (In a previous step, you marked it with a plus sign on its non-conductive side.)

, In a school classroom, this can be done by laying the cell on top of the lens of an overhead projector. In a home setting, another light source, such as a spotlight or the sun itself, can be substituted.

, Do this both before and after the cell is exposed to light.

Collect donut powder.,
Dissolve the sugar.,
Remove the fat.,
Use conductive glass.,
Make a titanium dioxide solution.,
Coat the glass.,
Cook the solar cell.,
Stain the cells with tea.,
Color another piece of conductive glass with graphite.,
Put a spacer between pieces of glass.,
Add an electrolyte solution.,
Press the pieces of glass together.",How to Make Solar Cell in Home," Buy a bag of white powdered donuts. The powder contains a chemical called titanium dioxide (TiO2). Titanium dioxide is a useful material for creating solar cells., Unfortunately, the titanium dioxide you get from a powdered donut will be not be pure. It will be mixed with sugars and fats. To remove the sugar, stir the powder into warm water and then pour it through a filter (a coffee filter will work fine). The sugar will dissolve in the water and pass right through the filter. The solid left behind is a mixture of titanium dioxide and fats.Use roughly one cup of water for every five donuts.

, The fats are not water soluble, and so they remain mixed with the titanium dioxide after filtration. Fortunately, it is quite easy to remove them. Put the powder on a heat safe dish and bake it at 500 °F (260 °C) for about three hours. This will vaporize the fats and leave behind a titanium dioxide powder., Most conductive glasses are coated with an indium tin oxide residue. This allows the surface of the glass to conduct electricity rather than insulate it. You can buy conductive glass online or at a solar supply store.This glass is usually found in 1x1in (2.54x2.54 cm) squares.

, Add ethanol to your titanium dioxide in a glass beaker and stir. You should use the most pure ethanol you can find. Two hundred proof lab grade ethanol is best, but vodka or Everclear will work in a pinch.Use about one milliliter of ethanol per donut and shake or stir the solution in a glass or beaker.

, Put a layer of tape around three sides of the glass. This will help you control the depth of your coating. Use a dropper or pipet to drop a small amount of the titanium dioxide solution onto the surface of the glass. Use a microscope slide to scrape the the excess liquid off, leaving just a thin coating. Repeat this process ten times.Each drop should be sufficient to coat the glass one time with a thin film. In total, you will use ten drops to form ten layers of titanium dioxide.

, Put the solar cell into a clear, heatproof beaker or dish. Place the container on a hotplate (or place the solar cell directly on the hotplate). Turn the hotplate on and cook the cell for 10-20 minutes.You will have to watch the cell closely. It will turn brown, and then back to white. When the cell goes back to its original white color, this means that the organic solvents (the ethanol) have burned off, and the cell is finished heating.

, Teas contain organic compounds known as anthocyanins. These compounds are good at capturing light in the visible spectrum. Brew a cup of herbal tea and submerge the solar cell for a few hours. Darker teas, such as hibiscus, work best. This will stain the cell and allow anthocyanins to bind to the surface of the cell. The cell is now capable of capturing visible light.Prior to staining, the cell could only capture light in the UV spectrum.

, This peice of glass will act as a counter-electrode. You can use a regular graphite pencil. Just rub the tip of the pencil over the glass until it is fully covered with the graphite residue., You can cut a thin plastic spacer to put between the pieces of glass. The spacer should go on the clean side of the glass (opposite the tea or graphite side). Alternatively, you can put tape around the edges on the clean side of the glass to form a spacer. This keeps the glass ever so slightly separated., An iodine solution is an ideal electrolyte. You can get it over the counter at most pharmacies. Mix the solution in a 3:1 ratio with alcohol. Put one to two drops of the solution between the two pieces of glass., Before the solution has time to evaporate, press the two pieces of glass firmly together. Use alligator clips to hold them in place. Your cell is now capable of producing electrical currents when exposed to light.You can test this by placing the cell in sunlight and using a multimeter to check for current.

This is another area where a professional (or at least an expert) can be really helpful, as there is a lot of math involved in figuring out the necessary number of panels.

, You will need to connect the panels to a charge controller. This controller will help regulate the amount of power in the system, keeping your batteries from becoming damaged.

, Assuming you have DC batteries, you can connect your charge controller to your batteries. If you have AC batteries, you'll need to connect your inverter first (see next step).

, If you live in an area where AC power is used, you'll need to connect your batteries to an inverter, which converts the DC current created by the panels into useable AC power. You can then connect your inverter to your main power supply or connect your appliances to the batteries directly, depending on the type you got.


If using AC batteries, connect the inverter to the panels directly and then the invert to the charge controller.

, Once everything is safely connected, you can introduce power to the system by connecting the solar panels to the charge converter. In the end, the panels should connect to the charge converter, which connects to the batteries, which connect to the inverter, which connects to your main system.

Mind the gaps.,
Change your lightbulbs.,
Plant leafy shrubs and shade trees around your house.,
Wrap up your water heater.,
Buy a programmable thermostat.",How to Reduce Your Home Energy Costs2," Sealing the cracks around your windows, doors, and around your foundation sill is a low cost way to put a dent in energy costs. You’ll typically use caulk around windows, weather stripping around doors, and aerosol foam to seal large gaps in out of sight areas (such as inside kitchen cabinets).Since houses, windows, and doors all come in different sizes, there’s no typical cost. But it’s pretty standard to use about a half tube of caulk on a typical 24”x48” window. Depending on whether or not a threshold is installed, weather stripping a door will cost about $15-$40 per door. A can of aerosol foam costs a little more than $5.
If you want a detailed guide on applying caulk to windows, check out the one at Caulk Windows.

, Replacing your old incandescent bulbs with LED lights or CFLs can provide you with tremendous energy savings on a lightbulb per lightbulb basis. CFLs and LEDs last ten to twenty five times longer than incandescent and they cost about 75% less to operate., Planting small trees and large shrubs around the exterior walls of your home is a surprisingly effective way to cut down on energy costs. This is because they cut down on energy in two ways:The proximity of the plants themselves acts as an exterior insulator. They make it harder for the ambient temperature inside of the house to escape.
Shade trees save energy costs in the summer by shielding your house from the heating effects of the sun.

, A water heater blanket helps prevent the heat from inside of the water tank from escaping into the air around the water tank. They’re usually made from fiberglass, and cost about $20 for a wrap large enough to fit a sixty gallon tank.

, Programmable thermostats save you the trouble of having to remember to cut the thermostat down every day before you leave the house. They have proven savings over conventional thermostats, and are easy to install.You can get a programmable thermostat from $25-$250, depending on how much you want to spend.
Installing a thermostat requires a little more technical competence than sealing windows, but it’s still an easy project. You can find a guide at Install a Programmable Thermostat.

Invest in insulation.,
Change out your old water heater and furnace.,
Replace your windows.,
Install solar panels.",How to Reduce Your Home Energy Costs3," If your home is uninsulated, you can probably realize significant energy savings by installing some insulation. Installing insulation in the attic is the most typical place where older homes are uninsulated, but if you are conducting an extensive renovation, you might use the opportunity to install insulation in the walls as well., If your water heater and furnace are older than ten years, you can almost certainly find something more energy efficient today. Whereas 85% efficient used to be the standard for furnaces, there 98% efficient furnaces being manufactured today. That means that 98% of the fuel the furnace uses is turned into heat.
If your household is smaller, consider a tankless water heater for energy efficiency. They cost about the same as a conventional water heater, and as long as you don’t use a large amount of water, will produce hot water faster and cheaper than a conventional water heater., It will be expensive, and it will take along time to pay for itself, but replacing your old windows with newer, energy efficient windows can bring down your energy bill by about 15%.

, Solar panels are the most expensive option for reducing your home energy cost, but they can also eliminate it entirely. Although the costs for solar installation have fallen substantially, the upfront costs are still substantial, about $17,000 nationally.That number represents an average across states. Many localities will offer more aggressive rebates, tax credits, and incentives. For example, California has over 186 different policies and incentives for consumers to make the solar switch. Kansas has 11."

, The amount that needs to be mixed should be mentioned on the bottle of liquid soap. Usually it is about the same proportion that you use when cleaning your car.

, If you have the panels divided into smaller arrangements then you should be able to get the job done with a small handheld brush. However, for larger arrangements it can be difficult to reach the panels in the middle so you will need to use the brush with the longer handle.

, At times, the wiper is attached at the back of the brush. It is important that you don't allow the soap to dry on the solar panels since this will block the amount of sunlight that they can absorb and make them inefficient.

, Sometimes it can be difficult to reach all the panels while in other cases you may have certain stains such as the stains of bird droppings that can be very difficult to clean. It is better to hire a professional than to risk damaging your solar panels.

Their focus is your house’s rooftop. Now I need to make this suggestion more specific. This suggestion only means the to-be-used solar panels not the whole system. Yet, as for solar panel installation, there are still some tips and tricks to address too. These panels are used to obtain sunlight. Thus, the more sunlight they obtain, the more electricity they will generate. Therefore, selecting a place where there is no shading and rich sunlight on your roof is surely a wise choice. The rest of this question is where other components of the system should be installed. The “other components” means a PV inverter and a two-way power meter. A PV inverter functions to convert the direct current (AC) generated by the solar panels into alternating current (AC), which is used by every family. It is so important that it should be installed in somewhere secure. The most popular choice is a garage. The two-way power meter used for recording the amount of electricity the system generates can be installed in a garage or somewhere you think safe or within your view., Once they arrive and the installer will come and install the system for you. Specially speaking, they will get onto your rooftop and choose the best place (where the most sunlight can reach in a day and there is no so much trouble to install these panels) to install the panels, which will be fastened by some racks. Also, cables are needed to connect to the inverter from the panels and to the power meter from the inverter. Finally, the alternating current will be transmitted to your family’s power system that supplies each appliance electricity., Obviously this is a typical grid-tied PV power system installation process. In this process, you don’t have to be anxious, for the installer will do the job. Truth be told, this needs the local government’s approval. The installer must hold a license to do the job. Connecting to the grid means your extra electricity can be transmitted back to the grid to earn money for your home. Also, it means if your system’s capacity is affected by special conditions, the system can send back alternating current to you."

Get a double-glazed unit for the sunlight to pass through.,
Get a single-panel room radiator that is slightly smaller than the glass unit.,
Build a strong wooden box to fit the double-glazed unit.,
If the box will sit on a flat surface build a support so that the box can be installed perpendicular to the sun.,
Treat the outside of the box to make the wood water resistant.

,
Glue aluminum kitchen foil to the plywood inside the box.

,
Screw two radiator brackets inside the box to support the radiator.

,
Insert a layer of 50mm thermal insulation slabs over the kitchen foil.

,
Fit the radiator onto the brackets and drill 20mm holes in the side of the box where the pipes will come out.,
Plumb in the radiator so that two pieces of 15mm copper tube extends 100mm from the outside of the box.,
Spray the front of the radiator matt black using heat resistant paint, such as that used for spraying the radiant parts of coal and gas fires.

,
Screw two angle brackets onto the bottom edge of the box and bend them up to stop the glass sliding off the box.

,
Run a bead of silicone sealant around the edge of the box and place lengths of electrical tape over the bead so the glass doesn't stick to it.

,
Place the glass on the box and leave the silicon to set.,
Screw L section UPVC strips to the three sides where the glass is flush with the box to prevent rain ingress.,
Get rubber engine hose with an internal diameter of 15mm from a car parts shop and attach it to the 15mm copper tube with jubilee clips.,
Finished.",How to Create a Solar Panel Water Heater," Glaziers and window manufacturers sometimes have scrap units for patio doors or large windows that can be bought very cheaply. Glass with a low-emissivity coating such as Pilkington K glass is ideal.;
, Scrap yards sometimes have old radiators, or ask a plumber who is refurbishing a central heating system.

, Use 12mm plywood for the back and 150mm x 50mm timber for the sides. Make sure it is deep enough to accommodate 50mm of insulation plus the radiator. The glass should exactly fit the box on three sides but overhang the box on the fourth side so that rainwater will drip off the glass when the box is set at an angle.

, In the UK an angle of 35º from horizontal works well.

,,,,, You can route one pipe inside the box to make both pipes exit the same side of the box if your installation requires it.

, Use threaded straight connectors rather than radiator valves to fit pipes that go straight out of the box.

,,,, This will create an airtight seal between the glass and the box and increase the thermal insulation.

, 45º mitres on the two corner joints makes a smart finish.

, If your hose is slightly too big solder straight connectors onto the ends of the tubes to increase their diameter.

, You now have a solar panel ready to heat water. In order to have a functioning system you will also need a water tank, a water pump and (if the pump does not run on mains electricity) a photovoltaic panel and control unit to power the pump.

If you have a car, get yourself a solar trickle charger to keep the battery topped off whenever the sun is shining.,
Find devices that will run directly from 12VDC.,
Some 6V items can be used in series to safely run from 12V, for example these $8 LED ""tent lamps"" from Walmart, using a slight variation of the battery eliminator idea; note that the two pieces of dowel in the middle are connecting the two lamps in series.

,
For devices that just can't be shoe-horned into a 12V system, you will need an ""inverter"", which changes 12VDC to 120VAC.",How to Run Your House Minimally Using Solar Power," This is a good first step in the right direction; as long as the PV panel is 20 watts or less, there is little danger in over-charging the battery (and the resultant boil-off of the electrolyte) even without a charge controller.;
, For example:


Many ""boom boxes"" accept 8 cells, which means 12V; you can make battery eliminators and run these directly off your car battery.
Linksys WRT54G and WRT54GS routers all accept anywhere from about 5V upwards to 30V or more, and use a size M coaxial connector (5.5mm x 2.1mm), center positive, which has become a de facto standard for 12V low-wattage devices. With one of these, you can extend your range of wifi access significantly, so you don't have to go without WikiHow as you learn energy independence.
Many devices and tools that nominally run off 6V to 24V will run off 12V, although it can be very risky to run a 6V device at double its rated voltage. One item that seems to work is the Panasonic RP-SPT70 active speaker system, shown in the battery eliminators article. An 18V device that works off 12V is this Ryobi reciprocating saw.

,, Realize in this case you aren't getting something for nothing; the 12V side of the circuit will be drawing over 10 times the current that the AC device uses. Unfortunately, most laptops will need to be run this way unless you purchase a special power adapter, sometimes called an ""Auto/Air Adapter"", that directly converts 12V to the 18-24V required by the computer.

Install a monitoring system to keep an eye on the performance of your solar panels.",How to Maintain a Solar Panel2," When the performance goes down you'll know that maintenance is required. Most of these monitoring systems need to be installed professionally with the purchase of a monthly subscription fee. Here are some advantages of installing a solar panel monitoring system.


You can keep track of how much energy is being produced by your solar panels.
Monitoring systems can show you how you are benefiting the environment, such as lower amounts of CO2 emissions compared to other energy systems. These statistics may help you receive tax benefits when filing your tax return.
Diagnose problems through your monitoring system. Many of these devices will tell you which areas of your solar panel are not functioning properly and need repair.
See information about your solar panels on a wall-mounted display while at home or via the Internet while traveling.

Look for a fan with a low noise level.,
Pay close attention to the kind of materials the fan is made of.,
Follow a set of dimensional rules when deciding what type of solar fan you want to install.,
Understand the requirements for adding a solar powered attic fan to a roof:


Use a curb style base for flat or low-sloping roofs.,
Install a solar powered attic fan:


Assemble a curb with the outside dimensions of 21 .75” x 21 .75”.",How to Buy a Solar Powered Attic Fan," Generally speaking, the more blades a fan has, the quieter it will be, (five blades are better that four). Each blade does less work and creates a smoother and more even sound, as opposed to fewer blades where the sound becomes choppy and irritating.


Running on low speed also creates less wear and tear on the fan and needs less electricity (less consumption it means is working better on cloudy days or days with low level of isolation.);
, It is important that the fan uses marine grade materials for a lasting presence on the roof. This will protect against UV and high temperatures. Many manufacturers of solar attic fans offer aircraft grade aluminum hood used for housing of the fan (this lowers the weight tearing of the roof and has a high resistance to direct mechanical impact).

, Look for efficiency and money well spent. Things to keep in mind:


Too small a fan will do very little to lower the temperature.
Too big a fan will be a heating drag for the wintertime or during the cold days when you want the attic fan still functioning, extracting humidity out of that place. (Humidity is generating mold and affects the whole house isolation!).

, Any roof 2 ½ -12 pitch or less should be treated as a flat roof installation.
The solar attic fan will be mounted as a light pitched to the shingle roof for fans mounted on the north side of the roof in any of the setups with a remote panel mounted on the south or west side of the roof.
The solar attic fan will be tall pitched for zones with snow.
The attic fan has to be installed 2 feet (0.6 m) away from the roof’s ridge.
The attic fan has to be mounted between roof tresses.
The attic fan has to be positioned in the center of the roof, where the most amount of heat accumulates.
The roof has to be provided with a lot of natural vents in order to ensure the right ventilation.
The solar panel for a remote powered attic fan has to be placed away from shades and away from chemises.

, Use pressure-treated lumber secured at all four corners with wood screws or galvanized nails (use 2” x 6” or larger lumber - adhere to local building codes).
Locate an area that is between the trusses to install the solar attic fan (southern exposure is recommended). Mount the curb to the deck centering the curb over the space between the trusses.
Using a reciprocating saw cut out an opening. Do not cut structural framing.
Place curb over opening and toe-nail into existing roofing using galvanized nails. If necessary, building blocking to ensure the curb is secure. Wrap the curb with roofing material to prevent leaking.
Attach the solar attic fan to the curb using (4) screws provided through the pre-drilled holes on the solar attic fan curb lip.
Adjust angle of the solar panel to position it will gather the most amount of sunlight (panel facing due south is recommended). To adjust, remove the center screw on solar panel bracket and swinging arm up to your desired position. Re-attach screw.

Ask for feedback from family and friends.,
Shop around.,
Choose high quality hardware.,
Demand a local warranty.,
Prepare and ask all possible questions.",How to Buy a Solar Power System," Because of the popularity of solar panels these days, there is a huge chance that a friend or family of yours has it in their homes. They will definitely tell you the truth about the product without biases and their personal experiences will give you a good idea on what or what not to buy.;
, A solar panel system for your home is a major purchase. Before you make that huge investment, look around and know the different prices from each of the companies that offer the equipment. At the very least, look for three quotes to know the average amount that you need to spend for the system. Choose the one that fits your budget without compromising the quality.

, Solar power systems basically consists of three major hardware equipments which are the solar panels, the mounting system and the inverter. For an efficient and perfectly working system, choose the best quality of each of these three such as those that have been certified. They may be relatively expensive than the others but you will be assured of their durability and life span. Plus, you will be getting a rebate from the government for purchasing the good quality hardware. Bear in mind that settling for self-certified, poor quality hardware will only be cheap initially. But, they can become more costly on your part in case they break or fail to work.

, Before finalizing your decision on the company that will install the solar panels for your home, make sure to ask them of what will happen in case you encounter problems with the equipment after it has been installed. Moreover, take note of the length of warranty. If you need to send back the item to another country for repair, then consider this as a major con and look for another company. Take note that claiming a warranty from a company outside Australia will not only be difficult. It will also be expensive. Your best bet then is to find an Australian-based solar panel installer. Aside from this, choose a company that will give you the longest possible warranty coverage of at least 10 years.

, Considering solar power is a major purchase, you'll want to do your own due diligence. There are a number of other important factors to take into account.Before closing the deal with the installation company of your choice, don't forget to ask the following basic and very important questions:


What is the needed size of the solar power system?
What is the Feed in Tariff?
How long will the system take before paying for itself?
What is the extent of electricity production affected by shade?
Is there a possibility of upgrading the system when needed?
How long has the company been in that business?
How many solar systems have the company already installed?
Is the company Australian-based?
Are the company's equipment exclusively from Australian-based manufacturers?
Do the company's solar panels have negative or positive power tolerance?
How can you claim a rebate?
Is the equipment they offer qualified for the rebate?
How much maintenance does their solar system require to efficiently work and still be covered by warranty?

You can mount your panels in different ways.",How to Build a Solar Panel," There are a few different types of solar cells to buy, but the best cost-to-efficiency option will be polycrystalline cells. Buy however many you need for how much energy/wattage you’re looking to produce. The specs should be listed when you purchase the cells.


Make sure to buy extras. These cells are extremely fragile.
Cells will be most easily bought online, but you may be able to purchase some from your local hardware store.
It may be necessary to clean wax off of the cells, if their manufacturer ships them in wax. To do this, dip them in hot, but not boiling, water.;
, You will need a thin board made out of a non-conductive material to attach the cells to. Lay out the cells in the arrangement you will use, then measure the dimensions and cut a board to that size.


Leave an extra inch or two at both ends of the board. This space will be used for the wires that connect the rows together.

, When you look at your polycrystalline cells, you’ll see a large number of small lines going in one direction (the long distance) and two larger lines going in the other direction (the short distance). You will need to connect tabbing wire to run down the two larger lines and connect to the back of the next cell in the array. Measure the length of that larger line, double the length, and then cut two pieces for each cell.

,, (Note: this step is not necessary if you purchase pre-soldered tabbing which is better since it cuts time in half, heats up the cells only once and wastes less solder)

, Repeat for other strips.

, Put a small amount of glue at the back-center of the cells and then press them into place on the board. The tabbing wire should run in a single, straight line through each row. Make sure the ends of the tabbing wire are coming up between the cells and are free to move, with just the two pieces sticking up between each cell. Keep in mind that one row will have to run in the direction opposite to the one next to it, so that the tabbing wire sticks out at the end of one row and on the opposite side of the next.


You should plan to put the cells in long rows, with a fewer number of rows. For example, three rows each consisting of 12 cells placed long side-to-long side.
Remember to leave an extra inch at both ends of the board.

, Apply flux to the length of the two thick lines (contact pads) on each cell, then take the free sections of tabbing wire and solder them to the entire length of the pads. Note: The tabbing wire connected to the back of one cell should connect to the front of the next cell in every case.

, At the beginning of the first row, solder tabbing wire to the front of the first cell. The tabbing wire should be about an inch longer than needed to cover the lines, and extend towards the extra gap on the board. Now, solder those two wires together with a piece of bus wire, the same size as the distance between the thick lines of the cell.

, Connect the end of the first row to the beginning of the second with a long piece of bus wire which extends between the two far thick wires (the one at the edge of the panel and the second being the furthest away in the next row). You will need to prepare the first cell of the second row with extra tabbing wire, as you did with the first.


Connect all four wires to this bus wire.

, Continue connecting the rows with the long bus wires until you reach the end, where you will connect it with a short bus wire again.

, Measure the space taken up by the panel on which you have placed your cells. You will need the box to be at least this big. Add 1” to every side, to allow space for the sides of the box. If there will not be a free 1x1” square spot at each corner after adding the panel, also leave room for this.


Make sure that there is enough space for the bus wires at the end as well.

, Cut a piece of plywood to the size you measured in the previous step, plus the space for the box sides. You can use a table saw or jigsaw, depending on what you have available.

, Measure two 1x2s to the length of the long sides of the base of the box. Then, measure two more 1x2s to fit between these long pieces, completing the box. Cut these pieces you have measured and secure them together using deck screws and butt joints.

, Using deck screws, screw through the top of the sides and into the base to secure the sides to the bottom of the box. The number of screws you use per side with depend on the length of the sides, but three screws per side is a good minimum.

, Paint the box whatever color you prefer. Consider using white or reflective colors since this will keep the box cooler and cells perform better when they are cool. Use paint designed for outdoor use. This paint will help protect the wood from the elements and make your panel last longer.

, Glue the panel with the cells which you constructed into the box. Make sure that it is secure and that the cells are facing up and can get sunlight.

, Get a diode a little bigger than the amperage of your panel and connect it to the bus wire, securing it with some silicone. The light colored end(aka white-striped end) of the diode should be pointing towards where the negative end of the battery(or device) goes. The other end should be wired to the negative end of your panel. This prevents energy from travelling back through the solar panel from the battery when not charging.

, Connect a black wire to the diode and run it to a terminal block which you will need to mount on the side of the box. Then connect a white wire from the short bus wire on the opposite side to the terminal block.

, Purchase a charge controller and connect the panel to the controller, making sure to connect the positive and negative correctly. Run the wires from the terminal block to the charge controller, using color coded wire to keep track of the charges.


If using more than one panel, you might want to connect all of the positive and negative wires together using rings, to make sure you end up with two wires.

, Buy batteries which will work with the size of the panels you built. Connect the charge controller to the batteries according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

, Once you have the batteries connected and charged from the panel or panels, you can run your electronics off of the batteries depending on the amount of power you need for them. Enjoy your free power!

, Purchase a piece of plexiglass cut to fit inside the box that you made for your panel. You can get this from a specialty shop or from your local hardware store. Make sure you get plexiglass and not glass, as glass is prone to breaking or chipping (hail will be the bane of your existence).

, Cut 1x1” blocks of wood to fit in the corners. These should be however high is necessary to fit above the terminal block but below the lip of the box to a depth a little more than the thickness of your plexiglass. Glue these stops into place using wood glue or something similar.

, Fit the plexiglass onto the box so that glass rests on the blocks. Using appropriate screws and a drill, carefully screw the plexiglass into the blocks.

, Use a silicone sealant to seal the edges of the box. Also seal any gaps you can find. The box needs to be as watertight as possible. Use the manufacturer’s instructions to properly apply the sealant.

,


Mount on a cart. One option would be to build and mount your panels on a cart. This would place the panel at an angle but allow you to change which direction the panel faces in order to increase the amount of sun it gets in a day. This will, however, require you to adjust the panel 2-3 times a day.
Mount on your roof. This is a normal way to mount the panels but the angle will need to be consistent with the sun’s path and your peak load time, typically in the afternoon, and it will limit you to only getting full exposure at limited times of day. This option is best, however, if you have a large number of panels and very little ground space to place them.
Mount on a satellite stand. The stands usually used to mount satellite dishes can also be used to mount solar panels. They can even be programmed to move with the sun. However, this option will only work if you have a very small number of solar panels.

Place a cardboard box inside a larger cardboard box.,
Line the inside of the smaller box with black construction paper, to absorb heat.,
Cover each piece of cardboard with reflective material such as foil.,
Attach each reflector to the top of one side of the box.,
Prop each reflector up at around a 45 degree angle.,
Position the oven in full sun, place food in the smaller box, and wait for it to cook.",How to Make and Use a Solar Oven1," Make sure there is at least an inch of clearance between the sides, and fill the gap with shredded newspaper, which will act as an insulator.;
, Next, cut the flaps from flat cardboard sheets in the shape of slightly flared squares. Since you will be attaching these to the walls of your box, the width of each narrow end of each square should equal the width of the side you’ll be attaching it to; the width of each flared end should be several inches wider than the width of the narrow end.

, Make sure it sits tightly around the reflector, and smooth out any wrinkles or folds. Secure the material with rubber cement or tape on one side of each cardboard piece.

, You can glue, staple, or thread them as necessary, allowing them to flop over for now.

, The easiest, most secure way to do this is to connect the reflectors together at the flared top corners (ex. by piercing adjacent corners and tying them together with thread, then untying them for disassembly). You can also stick rods in the ground underneath the reflectors, stack something underneath each reflector, or use any other method that will hold them securely in place. If it’s a windy day, make sure your reflectors won’t blow over.


If using rods, glue the reflectors to the rods to add more stability.

, It is best to cook the food in jars or on a small, dark baking pan. Experiment with cooking times and how and where you place the box. You may need to reposition your box several times during cooking to catch the sun.

",How to Heat Make Up Water for a Boiler System Using Solar Energy," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"" but a few of the items will be explained in more detail here.
, A solar pathfinder is needed to measure the estimated amount of sun that will hit the point for the collectors. Directions to how to use this device is located in the instruction manual provided with the device. This device can be found online and is relatively low cost. It measures the amount of sunlight one will receive at that location for over a course of a year. This is necessary information to have to insure that the location chosen is valid and will provide enough sunlight over the year., A loop system will be needed in order to maintain flow for the system., Temperature sensors must be installed at multiple points on the system to ensure it does not freeze., A heat exchanger is needed to make sure the system does not overheat., Ball and check valves are needed in case maintenance is needed. The valves will allow for the water to stop and the fixes can be made., Preferably somewhere with plenty of open space and limited tree shading.,,, Depending on where you locate the collectors, the piping will need good though put into the runs.

If need be, call a plumber for their opinion on ease of access for runs.

, The two choices are: a flat plate collector and an evacuated tube collector.

Evacuated tubes collectors are recommended for this practice, due to the fact that they are more efficient at higher temperatures.







, Attach the steel framing to the panel to provide support to the building.

Welds will need to be placed at the connections of each 90 degree bend in frame.






Bolts can be used instead of welding but be sure to get a Unistrut one-hole 90 degree angle fitting with bolt stud to support between each piece of framing. A local hardware store should have these.







, Be very careful when dealing with wires; these should only be fitted if you know what you are doing (and are sufficiently qualified according to your local regulations) or by a professional. (Refer to Warnings below.),,, Add sealant as needed. Use sealant tape when screwing on the pipe connectors.

, This ensures that the water will constantly flow in and out and will not cool.

, Consult a plumber and he or she can help with identifying the best locations., The heat exchanger will need to be provided before the tank and after the water passes through the collectors.

, These will provide the necessary readings that enable you to take corrective actions when needed., This will provide electronic readings of the data.


Once again, only do wiring if you're qualified or do it through a professional.

Cut a large metal drum in half vertically with a jigsaw.,
Clean the inside of the half-drum thoroughly with a de-greasing soap.,
Size and cut three pieces of sheet metal to contour to the insides of the half-drum.,
Attach the sheet metal to the inside of the drum.,
Paint the inside of the oven with a reflective paint rated for barbecues.,
Create a continuous metal lip around three of the four top edges of the oven.,
Flip the half-drum over and apply spray-on insulation to the outside walls.

,
Attach a base to the bottom of the oven.,
Drill drainage holes in the bottom of the oven.,
Slide a custom-sized sheet of tempered glass into the metal lip.,
Insert a magnetic thermometer.,
Place a thin aluminum grill along the bottom (optional).,
Test your oven’s heat capacity on a sunny day.",How to Make and Use a Solar Oven2," An oil drum will work well for this purpose. Be sure to use a metal-cutting blade; when you’re done, the half-drum should look like a cradle. You only need half of the drum to make the oven.

, Be sure to use a scrub brush and pay extra attention to the corners and crevices.

, You will need one large rectangle for the curved interior and two half-circles for the end pieces.


To make the large rectangular piece, one side should equal the length of what was formerly the interior height of the drum; the other should equal the curved length of the interior, which you can measure using a flexible measuring tape (ex. sewing tape).
To make the two half-circles: measure the radius (i.e. half the diameter) of the half-circular ends; tie a marker to the end of a piece of string and then cut that string to the length of the radius; holding the end of the string in the middle, use the marker to draw a perfect circle on the sheet metal; cut the circle out and cut it in half to make each half-circle.

, To attach the pieces with pop rivets, drill holes through both the sheet metal and the drum with a 1/8-inch (3-mm) drill bit, then apply 1/8-inch (3-mm) pop rivets. You can also drill holes through the sheet metal and drum and then attach them together with sheet metal screws; though this will leave screw tips sticking out of the back of your oven, they will later be covered by insulation.

, This will maximize the amount of heat inside the oven.

, This will hold the glass top (which you will slide in and out through the fourth, open side) in place. The easiest way to do this is to with six pieces of metal flashing:


Measure the short top edge of the oven and cut two pieces of flashing to this length. Then, measure the long side edges of the oven, subtract the width of the flashing from this measurement, and cut the remaining four pieces of flashing to this length; this will allow you to apply flashing to the sides while making room for the piece at the end.
Place a piece of flashing over the end edge so that the bent metal “folds” from the vertical outer side up over the horizontal top edge. Place a second piece of flashing over the first so that the vertical sides are flush but the horizontal sides leave a gap wide enough to accommodate the thickness of a piece of glass. Place a strip of something (ex. thick cardboard) between the two pieces of flashing to keep this space open, drill through both the double-stacked flashing and the drum, and attach them using pop rivets. Remove the cardboard and repeat on the other two edges.

Making a flashing “sandwich” (as opposed to simply applying one layer of lip all around the top) will keep the glass from grinding across the uneven edges of the barrel that you cut by hand.



,, Simply drill and screw the drum to the base that is most convenient for your location (ex. a piece of wood, a square aluminum frame with wheels, etc.), making sure that the base is wide enough to keep the oven from tipping over. Depending on your location, you may want to angle the oven to make the most of the available sunlight (ex. in the northern hemisphere, you may want to angle it southward whereas at the equator, you should face it directly upwards).

, Simply drill a small hole every few inches in a straight line across the bottom, making sure to pierce the insulation; this will allow liquefied steam that drips down the sides to escape the oven.

, Tempered glass not only is tougher than regular glass, but also comes with the sharp edges ground off, meaning you can use it as is. Since you will be sliding the glass in and out regularly, choose a thicker piece (ex. 3/16 inches / 5 mm) for additional sturdiness. You will have to custom order this at a hardware store based on the dimensions of your solar oven.

, Wood stove thermometers, for example, have magnetic backing and can withstand high, constant heat.

, Simply set a rectangular grill or two in place to allow for easy food placement.

, Though you can reasonably expect a max heat of between 250 and 350 degrees F (90 and 175 degrees C), the size, materials, insulation of your particular oven will determine how hot your particular model gets. Use this temperature to slow-cook meat over several hours as you would in a crock pot. A roast beef or chicken might need 5 hours, for example, whereas ribs might need 3 (plus 5 to 10 minutes of barbecuing at the end). Gauge your meat’s internal temperature with a food thermometer as you would while using an indoor oven.

Learn about the commonly used solar inverters.,
Compare the efficiency of different types of solar inverters.,
Take notice of the important parameter of each solar inverter.,
Check whether a solar inverter has tracking devices and offers optional accessories or not.,
Make sure the inverter you choose has stout features.,
Examine the inverter’s cooling system.,
Read its instruction and parameter carefully.,
Search the web to learn the supplier’s reputation.,
Inquire the warranties and services the supplier offers for its products.",How to Choose a Solar Inverter," Generally speaking, there are three major types of solar inverters on the market, including grid-tie, off-grid and hybrid inverters.


Grid-tie inverter: It functions to convert DC to AC, with an ability to synchronize to interface with a utility line. This inverter is designed to transmit your unused electricity to the grid and has no battery. MTTP technology may be equipped in its input circuitry.
Off-grid (Stand-alone) inverter: It works to convert DC to AC from a storage battery. These inverters are used to provide electricity to a number of residential and commercial projects. These lower watt ones are mainly used to power the appliances in each family.
Hybrid inverter: This product also functions to convert DC to AC and its difference is that it can be used in both a grid-tie PV system and an off-grid PV system.;
,


Since efficiency is the soul of every solar inverter, it is necessary to stress this point when you choose your inverter. So far, the highest conversion efficiency is over 98% from SMA, and the highest micro inverter’s highest efficiency has already reached up to 96.5% from Omnik. However, not all high efficiency inverters are suitable for your personal conditions, and so please be careful when making your final decision.

,


A solar inverter doesn’t generate electricity but it needs a certain series of parameter to make sure it works effectively. The important elements you should pay attention to are its input DC voltage, output AC voltage, frequency, and the circuitry that suits it. For example, for a typical residential solar power system, the input voltage is 24 and 48 VDC.

,


A solar inverter is installed in your home, but it doesn’t mean you are clear about whether it works well. Out of this concern, some inverter manufacturers have designed chips or other tiny devices that are set inside each inverter for malfunction tracking purposes. Once something troublesome happens, relevant information will be sent back to the installing company which can help deal with the problems in time. Besides this, you should also check whether the inverter offers your optional monitoring accessories that can help you monitor your system. For example, by using a monitoring device, a home PV system user can learn how much electricity the system generates each day, month or year.

,


Solar inverters are often installed outside a building. If so, they must be strong enough to protect themselves from different weather conditions. In this case you need to check weather the inverter has a hard shell or some technology that guarantees it can work well even in unexpected conditions. You know, high temperature raises the PV system’s voltage, and low temperature makes its voltage decrease. If the maximum voltage specification is exceeded, the inverter may get damaged or become even worse. When the system’s voltage is too low, the inverter might stop working. IP65 tech is a method that makes sure the inverter will seldom be affected by terrible weather conditions.

,


A cooling system is needed for any electrical devices. For a solar inverter which might be installed outside a house or in the open air, it can produce lots of heat from sunlight and working. Due to this concern, you must choose an inverter equipped with a cooling system which works efficiently.

,


An instruction tells you the basic information about the inverter. By doing so, you will learn the tips and warnings about how to wisely use this product. By reading its parameter, you will learn its size and basic structure. No matter weather you choose it for your home or power station, you need easy-to-install products. Some suppliers also tell you where its inverter is suitable to be installed. So, this process is important too.

,


Some world famous brands must be always known by everybody in this industry, but not all of them. You may meet some brands unknown to you, and so you need to search the web and check their rankings in Google or any other giant search engine. At the same time you also need to read others’ news, blogs, forums, comments, reviews and other forms of words about them. If they are generally spoken of well, you can learn more information about them and even decide to buy them. If not, you need to be careful.

,


In common conditions a solar inverter supplier will show the warranties of his products online. However, these warranties may not be so accurate for every of his products. In fact, companies often display a general description of their warranties for the save of simplicity and convenience. Although major services are clearly displayed, they might have some differences from what you think. Therefore, please contact them and inquire the exact information you need for the specific product you choose.

Air sealing of your attic should be the very first thing that you do to your home, making sure that you keep outside air out and inside air in.,
Revamp your windows.,
Replace old appliances.,
Use your appliances efficiently.,
Keep your water heater warm.,
Fix the furnace.,
Switch from incandescent to fluorescent.,
Add solar panels.,
Plant a tree.,
Finally, make sure to take advantage of the tax incentives for energy-efficient home improvements that are available through the federal government.,
Buy or build a rainwater collection system.",How to Make Your Home Energy Efficient," Think of it as putting long johns on your home.


Insulate your home. Adding new or additional insulation to your ceilings, attic and walls along with using caulking or weather stripping to make sure doors and windows are properly sealed will prevent cold drafts and air leaks to keep warm air inside during the freezing winter. When the weather heats up, these same improvements will help trap the cool air from air conditioning inside your home during the sweltering summer.;
, Your windows are a major source of heat loss in a home.


Replace aluminum frames. Aluminum window frames let heat transfer very easily. Vinyl frames are much more resistant to heat transfer.
Get multiple panes. Double- or triple-paned argon gas-filled windows are great for keeping the heat in and the cold out (the argon between the glass acts as an incredibly effective insulator).
Tint your windows. While you may not think that tinted windows on the front of your house looks very attractive, you can always do it to the back windows. It's surprising how much unwanted heat and cold you can keep out by having tinted windows.
Open the blinds. Why not leave the lights off and let some sun in? Lighting your house with sunlight is 100% free!
Energy Star-rated replacement windows is the most energy-efficient and cost-effective option.

, Older appliances are less energy-efficient than newer models. Replace these old clunkers in your home with Energy Star certified appliances. This will go a long way towards saving energy and lowering your electric bills. When it’s time to replace your kitchen appliances, the washer, dryer, water heater, or furnace, research the various models and features so you’ll know which ones are the most energy efficient. When shopping, look for models that are labeled as ""Energy Star Certified"" to ensure you’re getting an energy- and money-saving appliance.


A high efficiency on-demand water heater only fires when you call for hot water. It heats up quickly—and then quits burning fuel. (An added bonus is the fact that they are amazingly easy for maintenance.)
Get low-flow fixtures and appliances. Low-flow toilets, shower heads, and washing machines can save a lot of water.
Double the savings. For example, using low-flow fixtures (like shower heads) can ""piggyback"" on the use of a new, energy-efficient water heater and help to further decrease the energy usage in your home.

, Study the operator’s manual for each appliance so you’re familiar with the proper operating methods. Then, be mindful of how you’re using your appliances. Minimize their energy expenditure by minimizing their use. Do full loads of clothes and dishes each time. Since your refrigerator is the one appliance in your home that’s always on, maximize its efficiency by turning the temperature to the ""energy-efficient"" setting (if indicated on your temperature control) or to 37 degrees (3 degrees for your freezer). Also when you go on vacation don't just turn off your appliances, unplug them. Even though they're off, there is still energy that's getting wasted.

, The ""warm"" range (120 to 140 degrees) is fine. In fact, newer water heaters will turn the temperature down to 140 if you turn it up past that. It just doesn't need to be that hot.


Insulate the hot water lines to prevent them from cooling off quickly between uses.
Install on-demand hot water circulating loops that are activated when you turn on the tap and are turned off when hot water has reached the fixture.

, There are a bunch of things you can do to increase the efficiency of your furnace.


Get a high-efficiency furnace. A high efficiency furnace burns less gas, burns hotter, and produces less carbon emissions.
Change air filters. Changing out dirty furnace filters makes it easier for air to circulate and thus makes your furnace work less.
Seal ducts. Seal your furnace/AC duct work. Keeping air in the ducts until it reaches its destination will keep your furnace from working too much.
Add a programmable thermostat. Another furnace fix! A programmable thermostat means that while you're out, your furnace won't come on. However, before you come back home the furnace will turn back on and your house will be warm.
Close the vents in rooms you use less frequently in your home, like guest bedrooms, so you’re only heating or cooling rooms that are occupied.

, Although compact fluorescent bulbs cost more initially, the end result is considerable savings. This is because fluorescent light bulbs last 8-12 times longer than incandescent bulbs. Even using a mix of fluorescent and incandescent lighting throughout your home can have an impact in overall energy usage.

, Adding solar panels to your house can help you cut down on energy costs by helping you produce a little bit of your own electricity.

, Outside your home, plant deciduous shade trees in your yard on the side of your house that gets the most intense sun during the summer months (usually the side with the western exposure). The tree and its leaves will then provide shade during the hottest time of day and naturally help to keep your home cool. In winter, when the tree will be bare, it will allow warm sunshine into your home during the most optimal time of day.

, Recent increases in incentives now allow for up to 30% of the cost of home improvements — like new windows, insulation, heating, or air conditioning — to an existing home to a maximum of $1,500. That’s money back in your pocket in addition to your power bill savings!

, Rainwater collection systems allow you to trap rainwater that would otherwise become runoff. That trapped water can then be used as irrigation water for your lawn or plants."

Install a top-sealing chimney damper.,
Install a fireback - a cast iron plate that is placed at the back of your fireplace.,
Install a fireplace heater system.,
Install fireplace glass doors.",How to Make a Fireplace More Energy Efficient," Top-sealing dampers replace the fireplace throat damper and are installed at the top of the chimney. The top-sealing damper has a seal that acts like a storm door, keeping the expensive conditioned air inside the house and the outside air – outside. This principle works year-round, whether you’re heating or cooling your house. This product can be purchased online and is easily installed by either a homeowner or a handyman.;
, Its purpose is to protect the back wall from fire damage, and usually features a design that adds to the home's décor. The fireback improves the fireplace's efficiency by absorbing the heat from the fire and radiating the heat back into the room.

, A fireplace heater system pulls fresh air from the room, circulates it through a chamber that is heated by the fire, and then blows the heated air back into the room. These heaters are closed systems, so no smoke from the fireplace is invading the home. Depending on which kind you purchase, these heaters can make a significant difference in your home's temperature, even heating a full room on its own. Specific fireplace heaters can be installed with fireplace glass doors, saving you even more money.

, These will likely carry the largest investment, but you can reduce some of that cost by doing some of the work yourself. There are a number of fireplace doors that can be purchased online and come with easy-to-follow installation instructions. The fireplace glass door creates a barrier between the living space and the chimney, thus reducing the area that your furnace will have to heat. This alone is a good reason to install these doors, but it’s not the only reason. Fireplace glass doors offer another level of safety for the home by protecting children and pets from the fire. If you have a wood burning fireplace, you will want to purchase the screen mesh that is designed to go with the fireplace glass doors. This will allow you to have the doors open while the fire is burning while still protecting your home from sparks and embers.

Use air conditioning efficiently.,
Use electricity during off-peak hours.If you plan to use electronics like a washer and dryer, air conditioning, and computers or televisions, try to do so during off-peak hours like early in the morning or late at night.",How to Lower Electricity Bills in the Summer1," This includes turning off lights and other electronics. When you leave a room, shut off the light behind you. Unplug electronics that aren’t being used, such as cell phone chargers, small appliances like toasters, or power strips that provide power for many appliances.


Big-screen TVs, DVD players, digital photo frames, and other appliances use more energy than you realize.
Unplugging an appliance is best because certain appliances use energy even if they are turned off.
Consult with roommates or coworkers before unplugging a shared appliance.;
, Spending a lot of time indoors will naturally lead to higher energy costs because you will be using lights, electronics, and air conditioning. Spending more time outdoors means you can turn off indoor electronics, and in the process, you will have fun going to the beach, the park, the movies, and so on. Turn off all electronics before leaving the house.

, The sun can heat up a room very quickly. Keeping the sun from shining into windows will cut down on cooling costs, and many stores sell curtains specifically designed for this purpose.

, Circulation is important to using less air conditioning during the summer. Cool down the house early in the morning by placing a box fan in the window and opening up another window at the opposite end of the house, in addition to turning on ceiling fans. Box fans sit perfectly in most windows and help cool air come inside.


Most central air conditioners will also have internal fans to help circulate the air in your house while reducing your need to use the air conditioner. Turn the fan on “auto.”
Using fans at night will help a natural breeze cool down your house; this will only work if you live in an area that drops in temperature at night.
Turn a fan directly towards yourself or guests if the temperature is very hot.

, Set the thermostat to 78, and don't lower it. You can also turn the air conditioning off at night and in the early morning. If you want to invest in an energy efficient air conditioner, these are 10-15% more efficient.The smaller the difference between the outdoor and indoor temperatures, the smaller your bill.
Do not place appliances that give off heat, such as lamps or TVs, near an air conditioner’s thermostat.

, Electrical companies charge less for energy consumed during off-peak hours.


It is recommended you wait until after 6 pm to cook, do laundry, or wash dishes on days the temperature is over 90 degrees.

, In many states, you can choose a company, called an energy supplier, instead of your utility to supply your power. Just like how you can choose your own cell phone company. Your bills would still come from your utility since the utility owns the power lines to your house, but the actual cost for your power is under your control. There are comparison websites where you can see several options for lower electricity rates per kilowatt hour with multiple energy suppliers and sign up within minutes. Be sure to read the fine print as some contracts have hidden fees or have a rate spike after the end of the contract term. You can research on your utility's website and the internet to find reputable companies to choose from.

It communicates with a display inside your house and it can also upload your information to the Internet so that you may analyze it.





;
, It is a dangerous job because the meter has to be hooked up to active electric circuits. The electrician can do this without asking the power company for a disruption in service. However, it should be a fast job for the electrician.

, Does the watt usage jump at a certain time of the day? If so, you can analyze the major contributors to your electricity usage and power bill, and minimize or possibly eliminate them.

, Also, experiment with turning lights off or covering windows to see how your power usage changes.

, The major advantage of the whole house meter is that it helps to change your behavior with your appliances and electricity. These positive changes reduce electricity usage, which lowers electric bills.


A Canadian whole house meter company monitored 30,000 people who used their device over an 18 month period. They reported that electric bills were reduced by 6.5 percent on average. This would recoup the price of the whole house meter.

Be sure to set reasonable but finite limits on categories where costs aren’t predetermined, like food or entertainment. Setting a budget will make you aware of how much you’re spending on a given thing.
Monitor your spending throughout the month to ensure you stay on budget. You could do this tracking your purchases on a spreadsheet that you update each week or by using a financial app or software.
Banking companies often offer customers budgeting apps to help you monitor your expenses. There are also unaffiliated apps like PocketGuard and Spendee that can help you track finances.

, Living frugally generally means living below your means so that you can save and plan ahead for large expenses or emergencies. When you budget, be sure to set aside some money for savings.The more you can set aside, the better. However, you can start small, with as little as $50-100 per month. Once you can comfortably save that much, try increasing the amount over time.

, One of the main points of frugality is to help secure your financial future. And, even the best-laid budgets sometimes fall through. It’s important to incorporate the future and potential crises into your financial planning.


Populate an emergency fund in a high interest money market or at least in a savings account with your current bank. Then forget about it.
If you have already done that, then jumpstart your 401(k)/403(b) for retirement. If you are already maxing that out, then drop it into an index fund (that is, a low-overhead, lower risk investment in all the securities associated with a particular stock index, such as the S&P 500). Anything is fine, except parking it in your checking account and having access to it through your debit card.
If you get a windfall or raise, consider saving or investing it instead of immediately spending it.

, Setting up automatic payments can help you track recurring expenses and avoid late fees. They’re especially useful for rents, utilities, and monthly service charges. It might be frightening to have so much money taken out of your account immediately each month, but it is far better to scrape by until you adjust than to miss a payment here and/or there and have your credit report take a hit from late or non-payment.


Automatic payments will also help you immediately judge how much you have left over for variable expenses in your monthly your budget.
Most companies have automatic payment options that you can enroll in online or over the phone. Your bank should also allow you to set up automatic payments through their online banking app.

, Purchasing things on a whim, like a fancy dinner or state-of-the-art juicing machine, can suck up a lot of income. Practice patience with your spending; exercising will power in the short term can help build long-term financial solvency and gain. Wait to buy things until they fit in your budget.Often times you’ll find if you sit on a non-essential purchase, you’re not as keen on it as you were at first anyway. Wait to see if something is really worth purchasing.

, Accrued interest on your debts can seriously add up. If at all possible, pay off loans as quickly as possible to avoid paying exorbitant interest charges over time.Avoid using credit cards with high, variable interest rates. If your credit card has more than 15% APR, shop around for a better deal.
Avoid putting purchases on credit cards if you know that you will not be able to pay them off within your monthly payment period.
If you need to spend more than you can pay, consider transferring the balance to a new credit card with an introductory rate of 0%APR for 12-18 months and free balance transfers for 6 or more months. Then, pay off the balance as soon as you can before the interest kicks in.
If you have a mortgage or other sizable loan, try to overpay a bit each month. Even a monthly overpayment of $100 can save you tens of thousands of dollars in the long run.

Cook instead of eat out.,
Buy used.,
Switch to a water filter.,
Buy store bands and generics.,
Use a shaving razor subscription service.,
Stop buying small items on credit.",How to Reduce Wasteful Spending1," One of the easiest ways to overspend is by regularly eating out. Restaurant meals don't necessarily seem like big expenses, but they add up. Although cooking all your meals at home can seem like a big time commitment, you can minimize the time by doing the following:Use a grocery delivery service. Grocery delivery services are cheaper and more convenient than ever. Services like Instacart allow you to order groceries online and have them delivered to your door in about an hour. Although there is a charge, the charge plus the price of groceries still comes out to less than the price of eating out all the time.
Cook several meals at once. A great way to get int the habit of cooking is to cook a week's worth of meals at one time. Just pick a day when you'll have extra time (like a Saturday or Sunday) and take care of it all in one fell swoop.;
, You’ll pay a premium for almost anything you buy new, but a lot of products are equally good whether they’re new or used. Before you buy something new, check thrift stores, ebay, and classified listings to see if you can find the same thing used. Some great things to buy used are:


Cars. Buying a new car is almost never financially wiser than buying a used car. The minute you drive a car off the lot, it loses 10% of its value, and will have lost almost 20% by the end of the first year. By the end of year four, it’s worth half as much as it was new. There’s no need for you to be the owner that eats the depreciation.Books. A new hardback book will easily cost $20. A used hardback will usually cost less than half that, and used paperbacks can easily be bought for a dollar at local thrift stores. A new book doesn’t read better than a used one, so there’s no good reason to buy new books. With the advent of marketplaces like Amazon, AbeBooks, and eBay (not to mention libraries), you can almost always find a used version of the title you’re looking for.Clothes. While you might not be able to find as good a selection of used clothes as you can books or cars, most localities have resale shops where you can find gently used designer clothes at steep discounts. Buffalo Exchange is a national chain, but there are almost always local options as well.

, A few notorious examples notwithstanding, tap water is almost always as safe to drink as bottled water. If you’re really concerned about the safety of your water, buy a water filter.


The average cost of tap water in the US is .4 of a penny per gallon. Assuming a 20 oz. bottle of water costs $1.25, bottled water costs about $8.00 per gallon. You can purchase an on-tap water filter for as little as $25, and a filter pitcher for even less. The investment will pay for itself within a month., Although there are a few products—usually a food product or a tool—with discernible differences between name-brands and off brands, other products are exactly the same. Generic drugs, both over-the-counter and prescription, are required by the FDA to be exactly the same as their name brand counterparts, and generic drugs regularly cost as much as 50% less than the name brand.For instance, a bottle of 500 Walgreen’s brand 325mg aspirin tablets cost $.01 per pill. The largest bottle Bayer offers at Walgreens contains 300 tablets and costs $.06 a pill., Virtually every consumer feels that store bought shaving razors are too expensive. But for a long time, there was no alternative. A consumer could stop shaving, learn to shave with a cut-throat razor, or buy safety razors in the store. This is no longer the case. There are a variety of companies offering razors by mail, with prices ranging from $3.00 per shipment to $22.45 per shipment.A razor subscription service should not be thought of as something that is solely the domain of men. The biggest difference between men's and women's razors is the color of the handle. The blades are no different.

, Credit cards serve a purpose, but they’re best reserved for larger purchases and emergencies. When you use them for small items, you end up running up your bill with little to show for it. There’s no reason to pay 20% interest on a $5.00 fast-food burger.Even if you get “rewards” for card purchases, it still probably isn’t a good idea to use them for small purchases. Card companies make more money the longer you carry a balance. The rewards entice you to use the card, but typically only pay off if you pay down the balance right away.

Buy in bulk.,
Compare prices.,
Go for the best value.,
Negotiate.,
Shop at the right time.",How to Start Living Frugally2," As a general rule, the more you buy, the better the deal. If it makes sense to go for the larger quantity of a product, it will save you money in the long run.Today, there are many bargain retailers like Sam’s Club and Costco that carry nothing but bulk products.
Remember to only buy in bulk when you’ll actually use all of whatever you’re buying over time. For instance, bulk food can be wasteful if you let it pass its expiration date without eating it.
Good things to buy in bulk include foods with a long shelf life (like baking supplies, canned goods, or frozen foods), hygiene products (like shampoo, toilet paper, or toothpaste), and household cleaners and goods (like light bulbs, detergent, or trash bags)., Before you purchase anything, make sure that you’re getting it at the lowest possible price. For big purchases, do an internet search by the product’s name to see if you can find the best deal.Price comparison websites, such as GoCompare, SuperMoneyMarket, and Price Runner, can be good resources for tracking down the best deals for products and services.
When you shop for groceries, keep track of which store offers a given product most cheaply.

, Buying cheap products doesn’t necessarily save you money. If you go through half a dozen pairs of cheap shoes in the same time it would take you to wear out one pair at a higher price point, that’s not a good value. Look for products that will give you the most bang for your buck, not the ones that are the least expensive.Besides first-hand experience, the easy way to gauge the relative value of products is to read consumer reviews associated with each of your options to assess their comparative quality and customer satisfaction.

, While not all price tags are negotiable, you’d be surprised at how many costs and payments are. Used goods, service agreements, insurances, rents, fees, benefits, salaries, and wages are all generally subject to negotiation. Approach the proceedings with confidences, firmness, and fairness, and you’ll often come out ahead.Service agreements, such as communications services, credit card contracts, and even medical bills, are often negotiable. For instance, you could call a credit card company and say: “Hi, I recently received an offer for a card from another company with a low, fixed APR. Since I’ve been a longtime customer with you, I was wondering if you could match that rate. If not, I’ll have to go with the new company.”
If you’re worried about attempting negotiations, try practicing in low-stakes venues where haggling is normal, like flea markets or estate sales. Ask the vendors questions like: “Are you flexible on that price?” or “Would you accept $60 cash for that chair?”
Informed negotiators generally fare better. Do a little research into the market so that you have a better sense of what a good deal or fair cost would be. If you can say something like, “the Crain Dealership is offering this same car in the same condition but with fewer miles for $1000 less,” it makes your case more compelling.
Be ready to walk away. To be a successful negotiator, you have to be ready to leave behind a bad deal. For example, if your credit card provider is not willing to reduce your APR to match that of a competitor, just say: “Alright, then can you please terminate my account?”

, Avoid buying things at full price. If you’d really like a particular item, wait to buy it until it’s on sale or a coupon item or offered as part of a special deal.


Sometimes this means buying things out of season, so plan ahead. For instance, you can get your Christmas presents or winter gear for the next year during post-holiday January sales.
Similarly, you might wait to buy clothing until it’s on clearance at the end of the season instead of paying full price when a style is first released.
When you grocery shop, let coupons help determine your purchases. If there are items on sale that you regularly use, stock up while they’re on discount.
If you’re making travel purchases, research when the best time to buy a plane ticket is or wait until a particular airline is offering a deal. You can also sign up for fare alerts from travel sites like Travelocity or Kayak, which track the rates for each flight and offer predictions about whether they’re likely to go up or down.

Limit spending to needs, not wants.,
Downsize your household.,
Opt out of car ownership.,
Buy used, not new.,
Drink unbottled water.,
Cook at home.,
Embrace the DIY spirit.",How to Start Living Frugally3," Living frugally means living more simply. Take time to pare down your expenses to the bare essentials in each category. While it may sound like deprivation to limit yourself to needs, it can also be freeing, especially when it helps to get you out of debt and live more sustainably.For instance, you need food. However, you do not need to eat expensive cuts of meat every day or go out restaurants. On the other hand, you might feel that things that may seem like wants, such as organic milk and vegetables, are necessary for your personal health and/or ethics. Assess which expenses are necessities and which are luxuries.

, If your housing is a major expense, consider moving or taking on a renter to cover some of the costs. This could mean selling your house for a cheaper or smaller one with less maintenance costs. If you rent, it could mean finding a cheaper arrangement.The general rule is that you should be spending no more than 30% of your net income after taxes on rent or mortgage payments each month.If you are considering moving, be sure to factor moving costs like transportation, movers, closing costs, and deposits into your calculations. If the expenses of moving are too high, it might not offer you much of a savings. However, a short-term investment in changing your housing arrangement could save you considerable money in the long run.

, Personal vehicles come with a lot of associated expenses. Besides paying for the vehicle itself, you also have to fork over dough for maintenance, insurance, and gas--all for an investment that will almost inevitably lose its value very quickly. If possible, opt for non-motorized or public transportation instead.Walking, biking, carpooling, or taking buses and trains are all good, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternatives to car ownership.

, Second-hand goods can save you a lot of money, and reusing things is environmentally friendly. Used items general cost half as much (or less) than they would brand new. Go for durable and quality products that can be used for a long time, such as tools, furniture, housewares, clothing, and vehicles.Electronics and technology, which often become obsolete very quickly, may not provide much of a savings when purchased used.

, Beverages like soft drinks, caffeinated beverages, and alcohol can get very expensive very quickly. In a single day, you may find yourself shelling out money for juice, lattes, bottled water, and glasses of wine. What’s more, these beverages have very little nutritional value; you’re better off sticking to water.Instead of splurging on beverages when you go out, carry a water bottle with you that can be refilled whenever you get thirsty.
If you’re headed to a bar, limit yourself to one drink or opt for less expensive beverages, like soda water.
This might be a tall task for some, so it’s something to implement slowly, cutting out one extraneous beverage at a time.

, Dining in is usually much more cost-effective than going out. Besides the food being more expensive, you also pay for sales taxes and service charges. If you frequent restaurants, start making meals at home instead.Plan a weekly menu in advance, so that you can buy only the food that you need and won’t be tempted to go out when there’s nothing in the fridge.
If you go to work, be sure to pack a breakfast and/or lunch instead of hitting the local restaurant or food cart. It’s a move that’s likely to make you healthier, too.

, Labor costs can really add up when it comes to home repairs and improvements. Taking time to learn how to deal with simple plumbing, carpentry, gardening, and remodeling tasks around your house can save you a lot of money each year.Thankfully, there are now a wide variety of online tutorials available to help hone your do-it-yourself skills. Do an online or YouTube search to find information on the task you need, like unclogging a drain or fixing the fan element in your oven.

Keep out of the coffee shops.,
Cancel your gym membership.,
Don’t play the lottery.",How to Reduce Wasteful Spending2," You can save a considerable amount of money simply by purchasing a Thermos and taking coffee with you, or making a pot at the office where you work. While the supposed convenience of the coffee shop is an attraction, when the length of the morning queue and the price are factored in, making your own coffee is the superior choice.A 20 oz. cup of coffee at Starbucks costs $2.55, and regular coffee is one of the cheaper items on Starbucks’ menu. If you buy one large cup of coffee at Starbucks five times a week, over the course of a year, you’ll spend more than $600 on coffee.A pound of mid-level coffee will cost about $10 per pound, and will yield between 64-36 cups of coffee, depending on strength and size of the cup.

, Unless you happen to be a body builder, there is little reason to pay for a gym membership. By combining calisthenics (like pull-ups and push-ups) and cardiovascular exercise (such as running or jumping rope), a person can maintain high levels of fitness with virtually no equipment., While buying a lottery ticket a couple times a year might be harmless, playing the lottery regularly is nothing but a waste of money. It’s gambling, pure and simple, but it’s gambling with especially poor odds.For example, the odds of winning straight craps is a little under 50%. The odds of winning a lottery are rarely more than 100 million to 1. If you’re going to gamble, at least play a game you can win."

Add up what you spend.,
Think of a purchase in terms of hours worked.,
Buy what you need, not what’s on sale.,
Carry cash.,
Delay a purchase.,
Save something.",How to Reduce Wasteful Spending3," Keeping track of spending is the type of advice that almost everyone “knows” already, but few people actually do. It’s easy to put off, and keeping track of your spending takes a commitment over time and can force you to confront some uncomfortable truths about how you manage your money. Nonetheless, almost everyone who takes the time to track every penny of their spending for at least a week is glad they did., Instead of thinking about a purchase as a proportion of your whole paycheck, think about it in terms of the hours you have to work in order to buy the item. The reason for this simple: your paycheck is usually a lot bigger than a single purchase. Any one item is going to be much closer to your hourly wage, so it helps keep in perspective the effort you put into every purchase you make.Even if you are on salary, you can calculate your rough hourly wage pretty easily. Just take your weekly salary and divide it by the number of hours you work.

, It can be tempting to spring for a sale item. Making a buy at lower than market price makes us feel like shrewd, savvy shoppers. However, it’s a good way to spend more money than you planned on spending. Instead, just buy what you need. If you want to feel shrewd, find discounts on the item you’re already going to buy., It can be very easy to overspend when you can’t physically see the amount of money you’re spending. Instead of using your card for everything, make one large withdrawal at the beginning of the week and spend it as you go. It will be much easier to monitor your spending if you do.This makes it easier to set spending goals and stick with them as well. If your goal is to spend no more than $100 on miscellaneous purchases, if you only withdraw $100 for the week, you’ll have a much greater awareness of how much you’re spending each time you need to make a purchase.

, If you feel like you must make a certain buy, delay making the purchase for a half hour or so. If you still want it in a half hour, get it. It will save you from buying something you don’t need on impulse., Even if you can only save a penny, save something each time you get paid. The process of saving becomes a habit, like anything else. The habit will reinforce itself, and you’ll want to save more and more.There are also quite a few apps that will help you save money. Apps like Mint and Level will help you track your spending habits and let you know how much you can spend each day, while Digit actually keeps track of your spending and makes small withdrawals automatically."

Try reducing your spending before you commit to living without money.,
Examine your (and your family’s) needs.,
Read about others’ experiences.,
Consider what you have to invest.,
Understand that some expenses may always be necessary.",How to Live Without Money1," Making the decision to live without spending money is life-changing, particularly if you are living with and/or supporting others. You may find it helpful to start small and go for a week or month without spending money to see if the cash-free life is for you. There are many ways to cut spending in your daily life, and even if you don’t decide to go totally cashless, these techniques will help you save money.


If you live in an area where walking or biking to work is feasible, you could avoid your commute and its expenses (gas, tolls, parking, car maintenance) by choosing self-powered transportation. Plus, it’s great for boosting fitness!
Try going for a week without buying any groceries. Use only the foods you currently have in your pantry and fridge to make meals. Many websites are available to help you create meals from ingredients you already have on hand.If you enjoy going out for entertainment, find free entertainment in your area. Your local newspaper’s website will usually have listings of free activities and events. In addition to books and free internet, public libraries often have movies you can check out for free. Going for a walk or spending the evening playing games with friends or family is always free.
www.moneyless.org is an online database of useful tips and tricks for pursuing a cash-free existence.;
, If you’re a single person, living without money will be much easier to manage than if you have a family. Because living cash-free is a huge commitment, you will want to make sure that your essential needs can still be met without money.


For example, if you or a family member tend to require frequent medical care or prescription medications, living without money may not be a good option for you.
If you live in an extreme climate, such as a place that is very hot or very cold, it may not be safe to live without some temperature control. This is especially true if your family includes small children or elderly persons, who are more prone to heat- and cold-related illnesses and fatalities., Whether you want to take up a nomadic lifestyle such as the German cash-free liver Heidemarie Schwermer or live completely off the grid in a cave like Daniel Suelo, reading what the experience of living without money has been like for others will help you decide whether you’re up for the challenge.



The Moneyless Man: A Year of Freeconomic Living by Mark Boyle is a first-person account of living without money. He has also written blogs, a book called The Moneyless Manifesto, and established a low-cost living website called Streetbank.

The Man Who Quit Money by Mark Sundeen is a biography of Daniel Suelo, a man who has lived without money for over 14 years.
The 2012 documentary film, Living Without Money, documents the life of Heidemarie Schwermer, a German woman who has been living without cash since the 1990s.

, Some things that make living without spending money easier, such as vegetable gardens, solar power grids, composting toilets, and water wells, require upfront investment. The financial rewards of reducing or even eliminating most of your household bills are significant, but may not happen overnight.


If you live in an urban area and/or don’t own your home, your options for some of these things may be reduced. You should do some research to understand what is feasible for you.

, For example, if you require prescription medication, you should not simply stop spending money on it; consult a physician before stopping any medication. If you cannot or do not want to sell your house, you will need to continue making mortgage payments to avoid foreclosure and eviction.


If you decide to keep a job, you will need to continue to pay taxes.
In the United States, all adults are now required to carry health insurance under the Affordable Care Act mandates.Depending on how much income you make in a year (the threshold is currently $10,000 a year, but may change), you may be required to either pay for health insurance or pay a penalty.

Get a feel for two important words used in this article.,
Use metal (such as stainless steel) and not clay pans for cooking in.,
Maintain shiny outer surfaces on pans.,
Use a pan that is wide enough to cover the flame.,
Reduce the flame.,
Keep the pan closed whenever possible.,
Make sure the flame is colorless or blue.,
Use a cooker which gives an appropriately sized flame.,
Use a pressure cooker in place of the stovetop.,
Cook larger quantities and store for later consumption.,
Use a thermal cooking bag.",How to Save Cooking Gas," These words are sometimes used interchangeably and hence need a clarification:


Temperature- Temperature is usually measured in degrees Centigrade (C) or Fahrenheit (F). The higher the temperature within a cooking pan the quicker the cooking. However, a temperature that is too high may burn the food.

Heat - Heat is a form of energy and therefore is usually measured in Jules (J) or kilo Watt hours (kWh). In this case heat is produced by burning LP gas. The more gas you burn the more heat produced by the flame. The smaller the flame the lesser the gas being burned and the lesser the heat energy produced. Heat absorbed by a cooking pan and its contents usually cause its temperature to rise. However, once the boiling point of a liquid in a pan is reached further heating will not cause the temperature of the pan's content to rise until all the liquid has evaporated.;
, Metals are good conductors of heat while clay is not. For cooking to occur, heat generated in the flame must reach the food and hence pans made of good conductors of heat are more efficient.

, Shiny surfaces reject heat (by convection) at a lesser rate than dull or black surfaces do.

, - Flames that extend beyond a pan produce heat that escape the pan. Heat that is not absorbed by the pan and its contents is a waste.

, Once a curry comes to a boil reduce the flame so that it is just enough to maintain boiling. A boiling curry will be at about 100 degrees Centigrade. No matter how high the flame it is impossible to increase the temperature beyond this. Therefore maintain a minimum flame required to maintain boiling. (During preparation do not add excessive quantities of water expecting to reduce the quantity of water by cooking over a long time on a high flame. Instead add enough water so that cooking can be done on a lower flame for the required duration.)

, An open pan will allow heat to escape more rapidly than a closed pan would. Escaping steam too is a loss of heat. Trapping this steam inside the pan will allow cooking on a lower flame.

, Yellow flames are an indication that incomplete burning is taking place. This means that the full energy within the gas is not being harnessed. It is best to get a technician to take a look at the cooker or replace it.

, Many cookers available in the market do not allow the regulation of the flame to a sufficiently low level. This causes the maintenance of an unnecessarily high flame burning excessive amounts of gas.

, Pressure cookers are very good at saving energy because they cook food at temperatures around 125 degrees Centigrade (depending on the pressure of the pressure cooker) while ordinary pans can only reach around 100 degrees Centigrade (because they are only under atmospheric pressure). Cooking at a higher temperatures can significantly reduce cooking time.

, Cooking enough for several meals will save gas and time and is worth considering.

, Thermal cooking bag is very good at saving energy. It works by insulation which is preserving the boiling heat. Simply you can start you normal way of cooking till boiling point, remove your pot from flame and pop it in the thermal bag which will continue cooking on it's own.

Live off the grid.,
Volunteer on an organic farm.,
Move to a like-minded community.,
Become a house sitter.,
Live in the wilderness.,
Consider joining a religious community.",How to Live Without Money2," Find or build a home that functions with solar, wind, or other renewable power. Use well water or a local stream for water. Install a composting toilet: it will save water, help the environment, and produce “humanure” for vegetable gardens.Campervans (sometimes called caravans or recreational vehicles) may be a good option if you cannot afford a full-size family home with these amenities. It is also easier to find a site near water with a mobile home.
“Earthships” are eco-friendly, inexpensive dwellings that use waste products like old car tires and beer bottles as construction materials. You can often find these materials for free or very cheaply, and you can often barter for labor help.Even if you don’t choose to move house or live entirely without money, things such as solar power panels and composting toilets are friendly to both budgets and the environment.

, World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms is an established, respected organization that coordinates volunteer opportunities all over the world. There is a small subscription fee for the service. Usually, you barter your labor for lodging and food. Some farms accept families.


If you choose to volunteer in a foreign country, you will have to pay for a work visa. In addition, you will need enough money to cover your travel expenses.
Volunteering on an organic farm can also be an excellent way to learn farming skills, which you can then use to grow your own food.

, Many cooperative communities exist with shared accommodation and shared goals and ideals. They may be called “intentional communities,” “communes,” “co-ops,” “ecovillages” or “cohousing.” You may be able to barter skills or food for your housing and support. You can find more information about these communities online.


You will probably want to contact a potential community and visit before you commit to living there. Communal living isn’t for everyone, and you’ll want to make sure your potential home and your personality and values are a good match.

, If you are happy to move from place to place, then building a reputation as a responsible, trustworthy house sitter is a wonderful way to travel and live in comfort. Join online organizations such as Trusted House Sittersor Mind My House , or make a name for yourself in your local community as the go-to person for when people leave on vacation.


You can also check out organizations such as Couchsurfing or The Hospitality Club if you are looking for temporary housing, your plans are very flexible, and you are interested in meeting new people.

, It may take some time and effort to develop the necessary skills, but there are many opportunities for existing away from conventional housing. Caves and other natural shelters can be good choices. ]


Understand that this type of lifestyle is strenuous and requires excellent health and fitness. It is unlikely to be a good option if you are not in good health, or if you have children or elderly persons in your family. Move to a warmer climate. Living outside is much easier without vast fluctuations in temperatures, heavy rainfall, or frigid temperatures.

, There are many religions with communities dedicated to renouncing material living, such as Buddhist Sanghas and Christian monasteries and nunneries. These communities usually provide basic life support essentials such as clothing, shelter, and food, in exchange for your service and commitment.If your values and faith make this experience a good match for you, you can research your options online or by contacting someone within the community you wish to join.
Religious communities usually only accept individuals. If you have a family, this is unlikely to be a good option for you.

Educate yourself about your food options.,
Forage for wild food.,
Ask local stores, farmers markets, and restaurants for leftovers.,
Barter for food.,
Grow your own food.,
Start a compost pile near your home for your garden.",How to Live Without Money3," If you plan to forage for food, find a good guidebook on what types of plants grow in your area, which are edible, and which are poisonous; Richard Mabey’s Food For Free is a classic, illustrated handbook that is widely available and well-reviewed. If you plan to grow your own food, research the most effective ways of dividing land, planting seeds, and tending to your crops.


If you have a university or college in your area, see if it has a cooperative extension. These offices provide education for the community on many things, including food cultivation and foraging, and often it is free to attend classes or get information.
Remember that foods grow seasonally. Berries tend to be ready to be picked in the summer, while apples and nuts are harvestable in the autumn. Greens are often harvestable year-round. Whether you forage or grow your own crops, ensuring that you have foods to harvest year-round will help you keep a nutritionally balanced diet.

, Picking wild foods that grow in your vicinity is an enjoyable, eco-friendly way to spend a day and prepare a meal. Even if you live in a suburban neighborhood, your neighbors may have things like fruit trees that produce more food than they can use. Always ask before you take food from others. ]


Avoid collecting any nuts or plants which show signs of being partially eaten by another animal, have been broken open in a fall from a tree, or seem partially rotten, as these are likely to contain dangerous bacterial growth.
Avoid picking greens and other plants near busy roads, or industrial sites, where runoff from the cars or pollution from industry may have contaminated your food source. Instead, look for food in rural, less developed areas, away from the impact of cars, industry, and technology.
Never eat anything you cannot identify. If you’re unsure whether something is hazardous, it’s best to bypass it.

, Many grocery stores and restaurants throw away unwanted or excess food, as well as food that is past its sell-by date but still edible. Ask a manager what their policies are for disposing of these products. You can also ask vendors at local farmers markets if they have discarded produce you may take away.


Be cautious of meat, dairy, and eggs, as the risk of bacterial growth and foodborne illness is higher.
Independent and family-owned stores may be more accommodating than mega chain stores, although stores such as Trader Joe’s are well-known for giving discarded food away.
Make a name for yourself in your neighborhood. Most households waste thousands of dollars in uneaten food a year. Consider putting up a flyer in your local community center about yourself and your cash-free aspirations. Many people may be happy to donate slightly off fruits, vegetables, or older dried goods.

, Bartering, or haggling, for food, is a great way to negotiate prices, add variety to your diet, and exchange items you don't want for things that are more useful. ] You may find that people are willing to offer you food or goods in exchange for odd jobs such as window washing or lawnmowing.


Look at what you have to trade. Do you grow vegetables that your neighbors don't? Do you have skills that people around you need? Consider using your homegrown potatoes and handpicked berries, your fence-painting or babysitting skills, and your dog-walking experience to trade for fruits that you cannot grow or pick on your own,
Remember: In a successful negotiation, both parties win. Be fair in your request. Is an hour of babysitting really worth ten pounds of fresh apples? Or is it more worth five?

, The art of gardening is a financially savvy and personally fulfilling way to feed yourself from your own land and hands. It’s possible even in an urban or suburban location to grow vegetables and fruits. Even if you can’t subsist entirely on food you grow yourself, the produce you grow in your own garden will be healthier and cheaper than what you buy in the store.


Decide what is most feasible to grow in your area. The easiest way to determine which plants thrive in your region is to visit a local farm or to speak with someone who tends an extensive food garden. Differences in regional climate and soil greatly affect which vegetables and fruits thrive in which areas.
Build a greenhouse! Using recycled garbage bags over a wood frame, you can grow hardy vegetables, such as potatoes, Brussel sprouts, and radishes, in colder climates, even when there is snow on the ground.
Ask your neighbors if any are interested in co-opting a garden space. Sharing the labor and time necessary to grow your own food, in exchange for a larger space of land, and a greater variety of fruits and vegetables is a wonderful way to diversify your diet, decrease your workload, and build community friendships.

, Food that you collect that is no longer suitable for eating is still perfect for decomposing into a nutritious soil, perfect for your fruits, vegetables, and grains.

Learn to barter.,
Grow your own toiletries.,
Go “dumpster diving.” Many things are simply thrown away that can be useful to cash-free living. ],
Arrange a community swap.,
Make your own clothes.,
Arrange a skill swap.",How to Live Without Money4," Many online communities, such as Freegle, Freecycle, and Streetbank, offer listings of items and skills available for free. Sometimes the item may be something someone just wants to give away, or you may find people willing to trade items for skills you have.


Look for items you want to get rid of. One's man trash is another man's treasure, so instead of selling your old shoes or watch on Ebay, or throwing them away, try using them in exchange for items or services that you need.
Remember that you can also barter for services. If your home needs repairs, see if you can exchange some time or skills of your own in exchange for the repair.

, You can plant soapwort in your garden to provide soap and shampoo. Pastes made of baking soda or even plain salt can work as natural, homemade toothpaste.

, Discarded newspapers can serve as toilet paper.Stores may discard personal care products like deodorant and hygiene goods that are still safe for use after their “sell-by” date.


Many stores and restaurants throw away food. Anything that contains meat, dairy, shellfish, or eggs should not be scavenged. Avoid anything that smells rotten or odd. Foods such as bread, canned goods, and packaged products like chips can usually be eaten safely, but make sure they are wrapped and not dented, torn, or bulging.Be aware that dumpsters may pose hazards such as broken glass, rats, and even biological waste. If you choose to rummage through a dumpster, come prepared: items such as rubber boots, gloves, and flashlights can help you dive safely.Do not dumpster dive in any area that is marked as “No Trespassing” or similar. It may be illegal and is certainly not worth the hassle of being stopped or even arrested.

, If you have things in good condition that you no longer use, arrange a swap night. Invite your friends and neighbors to bring things they no longer want, need, or use. You can advertise with flyers or with postings on Craigslist, Facebook, and other social media.This is a great way to get rid of things like baby clothes that children have outgrown or toys they no longer play with. You can also swap books you’ve already read for new-to-you books, or get rid of extra linens and towels in exchange for things you need more of.

, Barter for a sewing kit and some fabric, and exchange goods for a few lessons on how to sew. You can scavenge for unused or still useable cloth, towels, and sheets to use as fabric. Fabric and craft stores may also have small scraps they’re willing to give away.


Repair holes, tears, rips, and worn spots. Keep any spare pieces of fabric from unwearable items to use as a patch when needed.

, Barter isn’t just for goods and services! Host a community skill-sharing group so that people can teach other what they know and learn things they don’t know. This is also a great way to socialize and make friends without spending money."

Use mass transit.,
Ride your bike.,
Walk when possible.",How to Live with Less1," This can’t be stressed enough. You’ll save on gas, vehicle maintenance, and car payments. There are a variety of mass transit options.


Get a bus pass. There are usually several spots to be picked up. The schedules are fairly regular. And in some locations, there are even employee commute plans and discounts.Jump on the train. Trains are a safe form of transportation that helps you avoid airport crowds, and you don’t have to do any driving. On top of that, the scenery is great, the boarding times are flexible, and there are often discounted tickets for children.Ride the subway. Subway rides are incredibly affordable, flexible, and have diverse route combinations. You can travel all over a large city with very minimal effort or strain on the wallet.;
, Bike commuting often saves a bunch of time on the way to and from work. Just remember to find a safe route, keep your bike working great, remain visible, and follow the rules of the road., If the store is just a mile down the road, take a walk. Be sure to find a safe road or sidewalk when possible, and always walk facing traffic. You’ll get some great exercise and you’ll thank yourself later.

Open the windows in your kitchen.,
Expose the burners on the gas range.,
Identify the pilot lights.,
Check the owner’s manual for the location of the stove’s pilot light switch.,
Do not smoke or have open flames in the room.,
Turn the gas valve to off.,
Confirm the gas valve is shut off properly.",How to Safely Turn off the Pilot Lights on Your Gas Stove," Before you can look more closely at the pilot light, it’s important that you open several windows in the same room as the stove so there is no chance of carbon monoxide gas getting trapped in the room.Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be poisonous at high levels of exposure. Your gas stove contains carbon monoxide, so it is important that you turn off the stove correctly and maintain good airflow when you look at the pilot light.;
, A gas kitchen range, or stove, usually has two or more pilot lights. There are one to two pilot lights that heat up the surface burners on the top of your stove and one pilot light that ignites the burners to heat your oven.To expose the pilot lights on your stovetop so you can see them, make sure the burners on the stovetop are all turned to the OFF position and the oven is turned to OFF. If you have used the stovetop recently, wait at least an hour for the burners to cool down. Then, take the metal covers of the burners off and place them to one side.
Run your hands along the front bottom of the stove top and the stovetop up. There should be a latch under the stove top to prop the stovetop up. Make sure the latch is in place and the stovetop is firmly propped.

, Once the stovetop burners are exposed, you should see four round cylinders for each burner on the stovetop, or two round cylinders if you have a two burner stovetop. There will be a main gas line on the left and right sides of the stovetop, running from the top and the bottom burners.In the middle of both burners, there should be two small openings. These openings are where the flame for the pilot light would be if the stove top was turned ON. There should be no flame, as your stovetop is set to OFF.

, Usually, your stove’s pilot light switch is located along the gas line on the inside of the stovetop. You should see a small switch or valve that you can turn from ON to OFF.Always double check the owner’s manual for your stove to make sure you have identified the right switch. Handling the gas line should be done with caution. If you are not sure where the stove’s pilot light switch is, call your energy company and/or the stove’s manufacturer to confirm.

, To prevent a fire or a gas explosion, do not smoke or have open flames, such as candles, in the room when you switch off the pilot light. Confirm the window in the room is open and there are no open flames.

, There will be a switch that you can turn from ON to OFF to turn off the stove’s pilot light. There should then be no gas going to the pilot light for the stovetop or for the oven., It can be difficult to smell carbon monoxide gas to confirm the valve is shut off properly. If your home has a carbon monoxide detector, it will likely go off if there is carbon monoxide in the home. There should be no carbon monoxide in your home if the gas valve is shut off properly and the pilot light is turned off correctly.The symptoms of CO poisoning include headache, fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, and dizziness. If you are exposed to high levels of CO gas, you may experience more severe symptoms like mental confusion, vomiting, loss of muscular coordination and loss of consciousness, as well as possibly death.If you experience any of these symptoms, you should leave your home and get fresh air outside right away. Do not stay in your home, as you could lose consciousness from CO exposure. Call the fire department and report your symptoms. You should also talk to your doctor as soon as possible and let her know you suspect you may have been exposed to CO gas.

Carry an aluminum or plastic bottle of water.,
Keep healthy, filling snacks in your car, pocket, or purse.,
Take a thermos to work.,
Chop your own fruits and vegetables for meals and snacks.,
Keep track of the cost of your convenience buys.,
Portion your bulk items rather than paying for individually sized packaging.,
Review the health-related costs of convenience foods.",How to Reduce Convenience Purchases1," Perhaps the costliest convenience purchase is also the easiest one to avoid making. Rather than facing the steep markups for bottled water, carry around your own reusable water bottle and refill it as you go about your day. Not only will you be kinder to your wallet, but you’ll also help diminish the billions of pounds of plastic bottle waste that accumulates in landfills every year.To stay motivated and remember your reusable bottle day after day, try keeping a 'proceeds jar' where you deposit the money each day that you would otherwise have spent on disposable water.;
, While vending machines and other on-the-go snack options offer you a simple, quick way to get your snack fix, they charge you a hefty price for the convenience. Most of the constituent items cost at least twice as much as they do at the supermarket, and that’s not even considering the invariably skimpy nutrition and empty calories of these options.Instead of resorting to these money-gobbling machines when you feel a hunger pang, keep a little baggie of nutritious, filling nuts, seeds, or dried fruit in your bag or car.

, Stopping for coffee can become a morning ritual as standard as brushing your teeth or eating breakfast, but keep in mind that this daily convenience costs you dearly. While making your own coffee costs about half a dollar or euro, getting it to-go at a café or convenience store can cost you four or five times as much.While single-use coffee pods like Keurig pods are more cost-efficient than to-go coffee, they’re twice as expensive as regular beans or instant coffee.

, It can be argued that the preparation and expertise costs of deli salads, hot dinners, and baked goods are worthwhile expenditures—after all, if you’re not a good baker or cook, you’re paying for something you couldn’t produce yourself. Paying two to three times over for a shop employee to wash, cut, or peel your fruits and veggies, though, is downright defenseless if you’re looking to cut convenience purchase spending.For example, a package of chopped pineapple will cost you about double what the equivalent of uncut pineapple will, while a package of pre-washed, chopped kale costs five to six times as much as the untreated variety!, Stores continue to charge extra and produce convenience goods because people continue to purchase them. People continue to purchase them because, among other things, they don’t realize how much more these goods cost in the long run. You can show yourself the light by writing down every bottle of water, packaged snack, and on-the-go coffee and totaling them up at the end up of the month.In the same way, measure how much time it takes for you to wash and chop veggies so that you can keep track of how much time you’re really saving yourself when you crumple to convenience.

, Even if you’re buying snacks or beverages in bulk, you could be paying a premium for the packaging. Rather than buying a bulk case of individually packaged bags of chips, bottles of water, or cans of soda, divide large, unpackaged volumes into daily portions. Buy big jugs of water, family size bags of chips and nuts, and two-liter bottles of soda, then portion them out in household baggies or bottles.Single-serving yogurts, puddings, chips, and dry cereals are some of the worst packaging offenders, as they use thick plastic, bags and boxes which need to be separated for recycling, or multiple layers of aluminum foil., If you still need another reason and incentive to trim your convenience purchase spending, consider the unhealthy contents of these items. After all, the vast majority of convenience goods are processed in some way or another, meaning that they tend to contain higher levels of fat, sugar, and sodium than their unprocessed equivalents.In addition to added calories, sugar, and salt, convenience goods also contain chemical additives, such as mold inhibitors or preservatives designed to grant them prolonged shelf-lives.

Rediscover lay-away services for gift purchases, household items and clothing.,
Start a Christmas fund or a savings account for large ticket items, gift purchases and family vacations.",How to Live Without a Credit Card," With a decreasing number of stores and restaurants accepting checks, a debit card provides you the convenience of not carrying cash and enables you to spend only money you actually have in the bank. Use caution when paying with a debit card, though, because these little plastic cards can, like a credit card, make it easier to spend more money than if you were actually counting out the cash or writing a check.;
, People tend to make more frequent and higher-priced impulse purchases when paying by credit card than if they are paying with cash or with a debit card. If paying with cash in your wallet or bank account, you have a greater tendency to stop and think, ""Do I really need this, or do I just want it? Is it worth what I'm going to have to skip in order to get it?""

, In a report released by MIT's Sloan School of Management, consumers tend to spend much more for an item when they are paying with a credit card than paying cash for the same item.

, Divide the money between envelopes you have marked for dining out, groceries, gas, tolls, extraneous items and entertainment. Using this method, you're giving careful thought to each dollar you spend while also setting spending limits each week.

, This requires a little planning, but more retail stores are bringing back the old layaway plans that allow their customers to ""pay out"" an item without having to use a credit card. Yes, you don't get to take the item home until it's paid for, but for ""nice to have"" items or gifts, you're able to pay for them as you have money and with little or no user fees involved.

, Set money aside every month or out of every paycheck to an account you've established for that purpose so when holidays come around or you want to take a trip, you have money set aside to buy what you need rather than relying on a credit card.

Find out the power consumption of the device in kilowatts (kW).,
Estimate how long the device will be used for each day.

,
Multiply the power consumption by the number of hours, to get the energy use per day in kilowatt hours (kWh).

This will then give you the energy use of the device for the year.

,
Repeat the above with the old device you are replacing.

,
Subtract the new device energy use from the old device energy use.

Freeze wet sponges and use them as ice packs.Turn an old baby crib into a learning or play area., Buying groceries costs a lot of money because it's not just the food you're purchasing. You're also paying for the labor required to plant, cultivate, deliver, and display the food where you purchase it.


Plant a garden. Depending on the plant, the yield for a year doesn’t take many seeds. In fact, to get a year’s worth some vegetables like squash, peppers, and sweet potatoes, it’s less than 5 plants per year.Hunt and fish for your own food. One mature buck will provide 50+ lbs. of meat. That’s countless meals. And fish are very plentiful in the right spots. You could provide the families meat for quite some time with just a few successful trips into the wilderness or waterways., The food bill, especially for households with several people or teenagers, costs an inordinate amount of money. There are several ways to shave that food bill down, however, and save some money.


Use coupons. Couponing has become an art-form of sorts, with TV shows and people actually completing huge purchases where, at the end, the store pays them. Learn the tricks of the trade, the discount codes, the “cash back” options, and discover the deals.
Take advantage of BOGO deals. BOGO, Buy One Get One, is something that happens at stores all the time. Especially large grocery stores. If you see something nonperishable that your family definitely is going to use in the future (e.g. toilet paper, soap, razors, batteries) and there is a BOGO, it may be time to stock up. The bill might hurt at first, but it will pay off eventually.

Cut a slotted handle in the side of a cardboard box for easy pull-out storage.

, Select seven versatile outfits, a hooded coat and gloves. Select three types of footwear to include boots, shoes and sneakers.

, Take care of yourself without some commonly used items. You can brush your teeth without a toothbrush, make your own shampoo, soap, deodorant, and toothpaste, and even use your fingers to brush your hair., Include a couple bath towels. Besides those towels keep a few multipurpose towels for hand, face, and kitchen usage.

, Use one large knife to chop and to cut meat, a deep frying pan to steam, fry, or sauté veggies, a spatula to stir and serve, a single bowl and plate.


Use a pot to boil and serve as a mixing bowl.
Try using a mug as not just a drinking cup, but also a ladle and measuring cup.
A fork can double as a whisk, and a spoon can double as a measuring device.
Use a towel as a potholder or trivet.
Reuse a jar for food storage or as a vase to hold utensils.

Draw up a budget for the month.,
Buy in bulk.,
Don’t buy day-to-day essentials at the gas station or drug store.,
Order your groceries and products online.",How to Reduce Convenience Purchases2," Perhaps the best way to limit your convenience purchase spending is to know exactly what items cost the most. Basic convenience items which don’t entail any skilled labor, such as frozen potatoes, meat, or canned goods, are marked up, but not as much as complex convenience items, such as prepared cakes, take-home dinners, and frozen pizzas, which take into account the cost of preparation and labor.Carbonated and alcoholic beverages also carry some of the highest markups at the grocery store.

, Many people make regular convenience purchases not because they hate to cook or don’t care about paying more for these products, but because they simply haven’t planned out their meals for the week. Since they don’t know what lunches and dinners they’ll be preparing, they don’t know what ingredients to buy, and thus they end up buying a bunch of ready-made foods, such as frozen dinners and boxed mixes. By planning your week’s meals ahead of time, you can create an exhaustive master list for the next time you’re in the grocery store, meaning you buy mostly basic, unprepared ingredients rather than packaged, processed foods.


If you need help organizing your list, try using a mobile app, like RecipeIQ or Paprika., In addition to planning out your grocery list ahead of time, you should also set yourself a weekly or monthly budget that accounts for this shopping. Approximate as best you can how much all of your weekly ingredients will cost, and then, if you buy unplanned convenience purchases, you’ll end up going over budget. Even if it doesn’t totally eliminate your convenience purchases, you’ll be able to keep track of them more clearly and see how much they’re really costing you each month.


As a general guideline, you should use 5 to 15% of your household income on food.If you’re spending much more than that, it’s a good sign that you’re spending way too much on convenience purchases or expensive items.

, Though it may seem odd, buying an item in bulk will cost significantly less than buying the exact same item individually. For example, while you should avoid bottled water in general for ecological and budgetary considerations, you’ll end up paying much more for that water if you buy one bottle a day from the drug store or gas stations. Instead, buy a crate or case of bottled water and keep track of the difference between individual and bulk expenses.


Specialty warehouse stores, such as Costco and Sam’s Club, trade almost exclusively in bulk products. You can also get bulk quantities of certain items at general retailers, such as Target and Tescos.

, In addition to thinking about what you buy, you should also consider where you buy things. Many items, including food, drinks, toilet paper, and cleaning supplies, cost up to 60% more at the convenience store than they do at supermarkets or warehouse stores. This means that you can significantly reduce your spending on convenience purchases simply by being strategic about the kinds of shops you frequent.Bottled water and individually packaged beverages are the most profitable items for gas stations and convenience stores, so avoid those tempting coolers next time you’re paying for fuel or popping in to use the toilet.
In the same way, don’t buy health or hygiene products at the grocery store or convenience store, as the typical markup for these items in such venues is about 100%., Some of the most tempting convenience items at the grocery store are pre-prepared bakery and deli products, and they’re also some of the costliest. Limiting your exposure to these ready-made tidbits can help you reduce your convenience purchases, so do your grocery shopping by ordering through an online service rather than browsing the tempting aisles in-person.For example, order toilet paper, paper towels, and cleaning products in bulk through Amazon, and get groceries delivered from services, such as Peapod and instacart.

Find the wattage on the appliance label.,
Multiply wattage by hours used each day.,
Divide the result by 1,000.,
Multiply your answer by the number of days you're measuring.,
Multiply by the cost of electricity per kWh.",How to Calculate Kilowatt Hours2," Most high-power appliances have an energy label on the back or base of the appliance. Look here to find the wattage, listed as ""W."" This is usually the maximum power the device operates at, which may be much higher than the actual average wattage.The steps below will find a rough estimate of kWh from this number, but your actual kWh usage is usually lower.


Some devices show a range of watts, such as ""200–300W."" It may be more accurate to choose the middle of this range, or 250W in this example.

, Watts measure power, or energy used over time. Multiplying by a unit of time gives you an answer in terms of energy, which is what matters for your electrical bill.



Example: A large window fan rated at 250 watts runs for an average of 5 hours a day. The fan's daily watt-hours equal (250 watts) x (5 hours / day) = 1250 watt-hours per day.
For air conditioning and heating units, make separate calculations for each season.
Refrigerators only draw power about ⅓ of the time, or about 8 hours a day if you never unplug them., A kilowatt is equivalent to 1,000 watts, so this step converts your answer from watt hours into kilowatt hours.



Example: You've calculated that your fan uses 1250 watt hours of energy per day. (1250 watt hours / day) ÷ (1000 watts / 1 kilowatt) = 1.25 kilowatt hours per day.

, Now you know how many kilowatt-hours (kWh) the device uses every day. To calculate your kWH per month or per year, just multiply by the number of days in that period.



Example: Over the course of a 30-day month, your fan would use (1.25 kWh / day) x (30 days / month) = 37.5 kWh per month.

Example: If you fan runs every day for a year, it would use (1.25 kWh / day) x (365 days / year) = 456.25 kWh per year.

, Your electricity bill lists the cost per kilowatt hour. Multiply this number by the kWh to find the amount you can expect to pay.



Example: If energy costs 17 cents/kWh, running the fan will cost (0.17 dollars / kWh) x (456.25 kWh / year) = $77.56 per year (rounded to the nearest cent).
Remember that estimates based on the listed wattage is a maximum. In reality you would be charged less than this.
If you're looking at a different area than the one you live in, search online to find the cost of electricity. For US locations, start with the EIA website.

Find the voltage in your region.,
Multiple amps and volts together.,
Multiply by hours used per day.,
Divide by 1000.,
Multiply to find the kilowatt hours for a larger time period.",How to Calculate Kilowatt Hours3," Some appliance labels do not list watts. In this situation, look for an amp or ""A"" measurement instead.


Laptop and phone chargers may list two amp values. Use the one labeled input., In the United States and a few other countries, the standard household voltage is 120V. In the EU and most of the rest of the world, the voltage is between 220 and 240V.In the US, some large appliances such as washing machines may be plugged into special 240V circuits. Check the appliance label's voltage rating to find out. (The label only tells you the recommended voltage, but you can assume a professionally installed appliance matches this recommendation.)

, Multiplying amps and volts gives you an answer in watts, or electrical power.



Example: A microwave label lists 6.5 amps and is plugged into a 120V outlet. It consumes 6.5 amps x 120 volts = 780 watts.

, The wattage tells you the rate energy is consumed while the appliance is active. Multiply the wattage by the number of hours the device runs during an average day.



Example: If the microwave runs for half an hour each day, multiply 780 watts x 0.5 hours / day = 390 watt hours per day.

, This converts from watt hours to kilowatt hours.



Example: 390 watt hours / day ÷ 1000 watts / kilowatt = 0.39 kilowatt hours per day.

, For example, if you want to find out how many kilowatt hours you'll be charged for during a 31-day billing cycle, multiply your answer by 31 days.



Example: 0.39 kilowatt hours / day x 31 days = 12.09 kilowatt hours.

Use the appliance as you would normally.,
Find your monthly or annual kilowatt hours.",How to Calculate Kilowatt Hours4," Also called a watt meter or kilowatt meter, this device measures the actual power your appliance uses. This is typically more accurate than using the appliance's label info.


If you're familiar with electrician's tools, you may be able to use a multimeter instead. This requires access to the appliance's wiring while it is plugged in. Needless to say, don't disassemble anything unless you know what you're doing.

, Plug the power meter into the wall. Plug the appliance into the power meter.

, Set your power meter to display kilowatt hours. As long as you keep the power meter connected, it should calculate the total kilowatt hours of the attached appliance.


If your power meter only measures watts, you can use the method above to calculate kilowatt hours from that measurement.
Refer to the power meter instructions if you're not sure how to change its settings.

, The longer you leave the power meter plugged in, the more accurate its calculation will be.

, The kilowatt hours displayed on the meter is a running total from the time the device was plugged in. You can multiply this number to estimate your kWh over a longer time period.


For example, let's say the meter has been running for 5 days, and you want to find the 30-day estimate. 30 divided by 5 is 6, so multiply the kWh displayed by 6.

Inflate the car's tires regularly.,
Check the wheel alignment.,
Avoid idling, unless the engine block is below a safe operating temperature.,
Avoid carrying excess weight in or on your car.,
Fill up your car early in the morning.,
Avoid driving aggressively.,
Use your vehicle efficiently and effectively.",How to Save Gas During the Winter," Cold air decreases the pressure in tires; poor tire pressure increases resistance to rolling in snow and slush. To maximize your gas mileage, keep your tires' air pressure at the level recommended by the vehicle manufacturer. Two missing pounds of air in one tire equal a fuel consumption increase by 1%,Improperly inflated tires will prevent faster rolling. In addition, under inflated tires may cause a loss of traction on wet surfaces or when cornering, something you can't afford to risk during the icy months. Remember that four bits of rubber are the link between your vehicle and the road. It is therefore in your own best interest and that of your passengers to make sure your tires are in excellent condition.


When adding air to tires during winter, it is important to blow out a little air from each valve and the air hose before pressing it to the tire's valve stem. This will stop any buildup of moisture in the tire valve; which could freeze, expanding the valve and causing leakage of more air.
Always carry your own tire gauge (preferably digital) for the most accurate reading.;
, Improper wheel alignment increases tire wear and reduces the stability of the vehicle. In addition, it is more work for the engine, which can increase overall fuel consumption up to 2.5 percent., Ten seconds of idling uses more fuel than restarting the car's engine. At idle, an engine uses a minimum of 0.2 gallons (0.8 L) of gas for every 30 minutes of idling and up to 0.7 gallons (2.6 L) for an 8-cylinder engine. A good deal of fuel is used during a warm up period, as many people incorrectly assume that idling for a long time is good for the car during winter warm-ups. For some cars, driving can be more effective for warming up the engine than idling. When starting the car on an average winter day, 30 seconds is sufficient for computer controlled, fuel-injected engines. Older cars will need longer, but no more than a few minutes. If you are cold starting your car, the best guide is to idle only until your coolant temperature is what it would be on a warm day. If you don't, then you could risk damaging things like the engine, drive shaft, and transmission. As you go about your daily tasks in your car, remember that idling the engine pollutes the air, which is why many cities and municipalities now limit or ban idling time unless it's an emergency. Instead of idling once your car's engine is warm, consider restarting the engine.


Avoid idling by ringing ahead to check that the people you're collecting are ready to get into the car as soon as you arrive.
Rather than sit in your car to watch a sports match or similar, find an indoor place to watch from. Wear plenty of additional clothing!

, Rid your car of unnecessary items as they weigh down your vehicle, making it less energy efficient. For every 1% increase in weight, there is a 0.5% increase in consumption in the city and 0.1% on the highway. Similarly, remove all equipment racks or bike racks on the roof when not in use (keeping them in the garage will help to preserve these items during the harsher winter weather, anyway). Due to aerodynamic resistance, a rack can increase fuel consumption by 5-10%. Any unused items lying in the trunk of your car leads to over-consumption of fuel as well.


Remove snow build-up from the air intake at the top of the hood. If you leave it there, the air intake will cause the defroster to fog your windshield.
Obviously, ""excess weight"" does not include winter emergency kits. All items you'd use in the event of a breakdown during winter should stay in the car. Also these kits should be checked for usability and durability at the beginning of the season (before any emergency arises).

, When the outdoor temperature is colder, the density of gasoline or diesel is greater and it takes up less space in your tank. During the day as the atmosphere warms, the fuel in the tank expands and becomes less dense. Due to this, if you fill in the afternoon or evening, your liter is not equivalent to an exact liter anymore. The change in fuel density decreases the amount of energy in each unit of fuel. Gasoline expands 1% for every 15 °F (−9 °C) and diesel expands 0.6%.Make sure that the gas tank cap is secured properly. Evaporation of fuel can occur faster if the cap is not aligned and secured properly., Keep a light foot on the accelerator and be an alert driver, ready to react well before it's too late. Excessive acceleration and hard braking can increase fuel consumption by up to 25%. Moreover, on slippery and slick surfaces during winter, you're less likely to maintain control over the vehicle and an accident can result. Drive at a constant speed, slow down to adjust to the weather conditions, and remember that the speed limit is not a target.

, Do you even need to go somewhere in the car? Places that are close present an opportunity for winter exercise. When you do need to go, plan your trip to go at times that are not excessively busy and do as much as possible to make value for each trip.


If you live where it snows, it is best to wait until the road has been plowed before heading out. Your car has to work a lot harder to make it through the snow than when a path has already been made out for it. Even then, stick to tracks made by other cars rather than driving through freshly accumulated snow, no matter how light.

Water and fertilize your plants.",How to Make a Living Wall," You may already have an idea of where you want your living wall to be, but you should take into account other considerations, like the weight of your living wall, the amount of sunlight your wall gets throughout the day (and year), and removal or disposal concerns.


Even if you're someone who has a green thumb, at some point one of your plants may need to be replaced. In this case, a living wall close to a door outside can prevent dirt or decayed plant matter from being tracked through your house.
Take a stud finder and make sure your wall has weight bearing studs. Even the weight of a single plant with its roots saturated with water may be enough to pull your living wall free from wall anchors. Fastening your living wall firmly to two studs should prevent this.
Imagine your living wall at different times of the year. For example, you may find that an outdoors living wall looks less desirable in the winter months if you live in a temperate climate. A living wall close to a large window might also be negatively impacted by cold during cold months.;
, There are many companies that provide prefabricated wall-hanging frames in which you can plant your living wall. Some models are even freestanding, creating a kind of living wall partition in your home, which might be suitable if you do not have load bearing studs to fasten your living wall to.You can also fashion your own living wall simply enough with wood, plastic sheeting, and a plant friendly fabric.

, Use a pencil and a tape measure to mark the dimensions on the wall you intend your vertical garden to be and note these down. These measurements will be important whether you are buying a pre-made living wall or making your own.


You might also want to mark the spot on the wall you've found studs. This way, when it comes time to hang your living wall, you can do so easily and without interruption., You'll need some tools and supplies to construct your living wall on your own. In theory, most box shaped frames can be converted into a living wall, however, for the purposes of providing a guided example, a living wall built from a wooden pallet is used. To create your pallet wall you'll need:


A wooden pallet
Landscape material
Plastic sheeting
Pair of scissors
Staple gun (and staples)
Wooden pallets can be expensive, though these can often be found in the dumpsters of local businesses. You might even inquire with your local hardware as to whether there are extra pallets available for you to use for a personal project., Use your scissors to cut strips of plastic that fit the contours of the inside of your pallet. Lay these along the wood on the inside of your pallet and use your staple gun to firmly attach each strip in place. Be sure that every spot soil will be held is thoroughly protected with heavy plastic sheeting.


In the event you don't have a staple gun, you can use tacks and a hammer instead. Make sure you use sturdy tacks that will stay firmly in place; a rupture in your plastic can lead to leakage that could damage your wall or dirty your floor.To ensure the health of your plants, you'll have to water your living wall regularly, which can cause the wood of your pallet to become compromised by rot or decay. Your plastic sheeting will prevent this from happening to the wood of your pallet., This often black textile will hold water and provide a moist environment for your plants to grow in. This will prevent the water from puddling in the crevices of the plastic, making it more available to your plants. Using your scissors, cut your landscape material in to strips same as you did for your heavy plastic, then attach the material in place with your staple gun or a hammer and tacks.The landscape material lining the inside of your plastic will help hold in moisture when you water your living wall. This will provide a healthy environment for the roots of your plants., Now that the shelves of your living wall have been sealed and lined with plastic and plant friendly fabric, you'll need to close the back of the pallet, which would normally be its bottom if sitting on the ground. Cut a strip of landscape material with your scissors that extends the entire back of your pallet, and attach it with your staple gun around the outer rim of the pallet. Then do the same with your heavy plastic.


You'll want to be sure that both your material and plastic are fastened to the back of the pallet as taut as possible. This will prevent leakage of water and dirt from the back of your living wall.
You may want to consider using some kind of adhesive to guarantee a proper seal between the plastic and the back of your pallet. A general purpose, water resistant sealer, which should be available at your local hardware store, should work nicely., If you've decided to build your own living wall, you may want to give it a test run before hanging it. Small mistakes in its lining can lead to dirt and water spreading to the load bearing wall your living wall is attached to. Prevent this by putting dirt in your wall before hanging and watering it. If leakage occurs, you may have to reline your living wall with plastic.


You'll likely want to remove the dirt you used when testing before you actually install your living wall. The weight of the dirt can make it extra cumbersome when hanging., Depending on the size and weight of your pallet, you may need a helper to efficiently and safely install your living wall. Hold the back of your living wall so that it aligns with the dimensions you have previously drawn on the wall. Use a level to check that it isn't crooked. Then:


Use your screwdriver and several suitable screws to anchor your living wall to the studs behind it. The kind of screws suitable for your project will depend on the size of your living wall. A larger pallet will require a sturdier screw to hold it in place., You should lay down a tarp or an old sheet to collect any dirt that falls on the floor. Take your potting soil and add it to the shelves/boxes of your new living wall. At this point you should also consider adding a controlled release fertilizer for your plants.


Controlled release fertilizers offer nourishment to plants over time, reducing the amount of continued fertilizing you'll need to do. As these fertilizers vary considerably from brand to brand, you should follow the directions that come with it carefully.You may want to leave your sheet or tarp in place while adding plants to your living wall. However, if you intend on growing plants from seed, you should be fine removing your sheet or tarp, shaking the dirt on it free outside, and then putting it away.

, What you grow is up to you! But to give you some ideas, some of the most successful plants used by wall growers include the lipstick plant (aeschynanthus radicans), the sword fern (nephrolepis exaltata), wedding vine (stephanotis floribunda), and wax flower (hoya Carnosa).You could create a mosaic looking living wall by growing succulents like Hens-and-Chicks (Sempervivum tectorum / Echeveria elegans), aloe, Panda Plants (Kalanchoe tomentosa), Christmas Cactus (Schlumbergera x buckleyi), and more.These will create a relatively low maintenance patchwork effect in your hanging garden.
In mellower rooms, you may want to give a relaxed vibe. This can be accomplished with climbing and hanging vines. You might try Grape/Oakleaf Ivy, English Ivy, Philodendron, and Spider Plants., Without proper circulation, your plants will have difficulty purifying the air throughout your house. You can improve circulation very easily by adding a box fan or circulating fan to the room your living wall is in. This way, more air passes under the purifying touch of your living wall.

, You may find, especially during certain times of the year, that your living wall does not receive the same amount of lighting it did when your wall was built and hung. You don't need to install recessed lighting, though, for your plants to flourish! A simple lamp equipped with a grow light can help your plants make it through the gloomier times of the year.


Grow lights are specially designed light bulbs that emit a kind of light that encourages plants to photosynthesize. Normal household light bulbs will not stimulate photosynthesis in the same way., How frequently you water and fertilize your plants will depend entirely on the kind of plants you have chosen to populate your living wall with. However, you should be aware that the resources normally available in nature won't be available to the plants in your living wall. Failing to water or fertilize can lead your plants to expire very quickly."

;
,


Put your bales in an area with good access to sun. Options include patios, balconies, backyards, or driveways. If you are concerned about dirt or debris, put a sheet or a tarp (not black) under the bales.







,


Straw bales naturally decompose, leading their temperature to rise past what is healthy for growing conditions. Water them several times a day so as to keep them damp. Within a week you should be able to stick your hand inside the bales and note that they are cooler than your body temperature: this means they are ready for plants.







,


The holes should be 6 in. wide, 6 in. long, and 8 in. deep (15 by 15 by 20 cm).

Be philosophical.",How to Prevent Theft from a Community Garden," Some vegetables and fruits prove more of a temptation that others. Bigger items tend to be stolen, such as pumpkins and eggplants, while spinach and herbs are of less interest. You might need to increase the amount of greens that look less like food to the uninitiated.;
, Consider ways to hide more tempting plants behind less interesting plants. Look for plants with a lot of green foliage that can serve as borders or hedges around vegetable plots.

, Build small fences or other barriers around the plots that block direct sight. If you have more funds, you might even need to consider fencing off and locking the entire garden.

, This might help to deter thieves who rummage through the garden under the cover of darkness. Solar lights may be a good choice., Once the vegetables and fruits are ripened, don't delay harvesting them. The keen eye of a thief will notice them quickly once they're ready for picking and leaving it even a day later could mean its loss.

, Make it clear when it's okay to take fruit and vegetables from dying plants and when it's not. Don't allow any ambiguity to give fellow gardeners a sense that there are exceptions of their own making.

, Expect some theft as part and parcel of what has probably been going on in community gardens for centuries. If it feeds someone who really needs it now and then, then it's serving a purpose in a quirky way.

Place water-heavy plants in one section of your garden and drought-resistant plants in another so that you can distribute water more effectively. Place pollinating plants with other pollinating plants so that bees stay in one section and help pollinate surrounding plants.

,


Low-cut grass lawns are unnatural in that they require lots of water and often need fertilizer to remain full and green. Allow wildflowers to grow with your grass to attract insects and enrich your soil.

,


Mulch can be made of wood chips, sawdust, leaves, bark, and even newspaper. Spread it in a thin layer around your plants to help keep in moisture, maintain a steady temperature, and reduce weeds.

"
Use a drip irrigation system.,
Water only when plants are in need.,
Collect rain runoff and waste water.,
Remove weeds manually.,
Use composted organic matter as fertilizer.,
Use natural pesticides.",How to Grow a Sustainable Garden3,"


Drip irrigation uses lengths of rubber hose with small holes punched in the side to distribute water along the roots of the plants. You can either make your own hoses or purchase a drip irrigation system.
Because drip irrigation distributes small amounts of water near the ground, there is much less evaporation than occurs with a sprinkler system and much less waste than with manual hose watering. Turn on the drip irrigation system in the morning to avoid evaporation by late-day sun.

,


Gauge your plants' water needs by feeling the dampness of the soil and watching the texture and color of the leaves. Do not water on a regular pattern or before or after rain.

,


Use rain barrels to collect water from gutters and pump this back into your drip irrigation system.
Collect waste water from your washing machine and recycle this into your garden. Do this only if you use biodegradable soaps and if you have not been using bleach. Consult your municipal authorities to make sure such water use is legal in your area.

,

Weeds steal water otherwise intended for wanted plants. Remove weeds by hand to eliminate the need for chemical weed killer.

,


Food scraps, leaves, and weeds can be recycled and broken down to produce fertilizer for your garden's soil. Place such material in a large bin with small holes punched in the side, then let the matter break down for several weeks before depositing in your garden. Most municipalities and local horticultural societies provide classes or guides for composting.

,


If you have a pest problem, opt for natural options like spiders (for insects), baking soda (for powdery mildew), or organic pest products rather than damaging chemical fertilizers. The natural options will allow you to target unwanted pests without harming other wildlife and plants.

Before you begin, find out if it is possible to create a garden on your roof.,
Work out a comfortable access way to the roof.,
Choose a design, figure out how you will layout the roof garden.,
Work out a planting scheme, with plants to work well with the natural light you have, humidity, wind etc.,
Get containers/planters, furniture etc to finish it off.,
Decide how you will water the garden.,
Consider windbreaks, as a rooftop garden will be very windy.,
Remember there are various details to consider when building a roof garden, terrace or any other structure on the roof, so it is perhaps worth consulting a specialist (or a few specialists) before you start your project.

",How to Create a Rooftop Garden," Make sure the regulations allow it, and if you have a freeholder - make sure they allow you to build it. You don't want to spend lots of time and money preparing for a garden/roof terrace and then find out that it is prohibited. Also make sure that the roof is able to hold the weight of a rooftop garden. For the majority of houses, flat roofs aren't strong enough for terraces/roof gardens. If so, figure out how much weight it can hold. Consult a structural engineer - you have to make sure it is not damaging your house. Remember this when making the garden and use lighter containers, soil, flooring, furniture etc.;
, You may have to consult an architect, or a roof garden specialist.

, Or use a designer to help. It is here when you have to chose your flooring too: stone, or decking etc.

, Or you can use a planting expert or a landscape designer to help.

, Their size depends on the size and type of the plants you chose. They also should be lightweight, but also stable. Perhaps think of how you can fix them and integrate them within your scheme.

, You can install a water storage system or an automatic irrigation system. Or, you can just carry the water up to the roof by hand, depending if your access way allows it.

, These can be trellises or other latticed windbreak, but it shouldn't be completely solid, since they will blow over more easily.

Amend the soil.,
Choose your plants wisely.,
Check whether you have a west or east facing yard.",How to Have a Sustainable Garden in Saudi Arabia1," Test the soil in your garden for salinity.


If it is too salty, remove and replace with sweet sand. Mix perlite and commercial potting mix.  
All soil types in desert environments will benefit from adding organic compost.;
, Where possible, use native plants or prefer plants that grow well in heat and do not need a lot of water.

, Your choice of plants will depend on the amount of sun the yard gets in a day. Know each plant's sun requirements. For example:


 Bougainvilla and lantana are two beautiful plants that are sun lovers.  
Hibiscus grows well in partly shady area. If attacked by aphids just give a good water hose blasting and it will be fine.
Cana Lily loves a sunny spot with plenty of moist.
Red palm, if placed outside, needs to be in a partially shaded area.  
Chinese ferns do well in partially shaded location with micro-climate environment.

Conserve water for earth-friendly gardening.,
Choose native plants and flowers.,
Try earth-friendly gardening methods to control plant diseases.,
Choose environmentally friendly gardening tools and equipment.,
Plant trees in your eco garden.,
Choose pesticides carefully.,
Kill weeds with natural herbicides.",How to Create an Eco Garden," Compost is food waste and other organic material that has decomposed. It adds nutrients to the soil and keeps organic waste from going to a landfill.


Material that can be composed includes shredded paper, fruit and vegetable parings, lawn clippings, dead leaves, coffee grounds, egg shells, and leftovers of meals. Don't add meat or dairy items to a compost heap.
Gather enough material for the compost heap to generate its own heat as the material decomposes. Keep the heap moist by adding water and aerate it by turning it over with a pitchfork. You can also buy a tumbling compost bin.;
, Consider using products like bone meal, blood meal, fish emulsion, and cottonseed meal along with your compost to amend the soil.

,

Water your garden with a drip line or soaker hose. These devices water very efficiently because they target the roots of plants.
Set out barrels or other containers to gather rainwater from your downspouts. Use the captured rainwater on your garden or lawn. You can also install drain pipes to take water from your home's downspouts into your garden.
Eliminate your lawn or shrink the size of it. Lawns require a great deal of water to stay healthy.
Make a rock garden. A garden of rocks and stones adds beauty and conserves water. Rock gardens are easier to care for than grassy lawns.







, Native species will thrive because they are naturally adapted to your climate and specific growing conditions. They require less water, fertilizer, and labor, and they benefit local wildlife by providing habitat and food.

, Potassium bicarbonate, milk, baking soda and cooking oil are safer for the environment than synthetic products.

,


Use a push mower rather or an electric mower rather than one powered by gas.
Use gardening equipment powered by electricity rather than gas. There are electric versions of garden tillers, weed eaters, and leaf blowers, among others.

, Trees create wildlife habitat, provide shade, and improve air quality.

, Most synthetic insecticides kill insects indiscriminately. This means they kill the insects you're trying to eradicate, but they also kill beneficial insects like bees.


Select pesticides that target the particular insect you're wanting to kill, such as fire ants or grubs.
Choose pesticides that degrade rapidly with the elements and weather.
Use natural products to control bugs. For example, use the milky spore bacteria to control Japanese beetles.
Attract bats by installing a bat house in your eco garden. Bats eat a large amount of mosquitoes and other pests.

,


Use acetic acid at a concentration of 20 percent to kill weeds. Acetic acid will also kill plants, so administer it with care.
Try corn gluten as a natural option for controlling pre-emergent weeds.
Use clove oil to burn weeds.

Fill with potting soil.,
Choose seeds or seedlings.,
Provide shade as required.,
Water regularly.",How to Have a Sustainable Garden in Saudi Arabia2," Consider sharing with neighbors who may also want to grow food, especially if you need to negotiate to get the rooftop space.

, Good containers include large plastic bottles used for large amounts of water or oil (6 liter/4 gallon), coffee cans and terracotta flowerpots.

, Add some compost to the soil to improve its quality.

, You might have a mixture of both ornamental plants (flowers, ferns, etc.) and edible plants (vegetables and fruit). This will depend on how much rooftop space you have. Some suggestions include:


Geraniums and scented pelargoniums

Eggplant (aubergine)

Okra (ladyfinger)

Potatoes (these can be grown in potato bags)
Herbs (such as basil, thyme, oregano, etc.)
Spices such as chili plants
Salad vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes and baby spinach
Marigolds
Annual flowers.
Vine plants (grapes, beans, etc.).

, Set up sail sheets, tarpaulins or similar covers for plants that need cover. Or, shift the containers to a wall that gets more shade.

, Use a watering can or other container to bring water to the plants. Don't leave it too long between watering, especially on very hot days.

Create a business plan.A business plan should describe, in detail, what your plans for the business are and what you hope to achieve.,
Take your business plan to investors and lenders.,
Register your business.,
Choose your location.,
File for any additional licenses.",How to Start an Organic Store1," It should also outline the steps you plan on taking in order to reach your goals. A business plan must include an executive summary, which provides a one-page overview of your goals, as well as a market analysis, company description, description of the product line, funding request, financial projections, and more.;
, Investors include anyone that you know or are somehow networked to who can give you money to start the business. Investors usually become part owners of your business. Lenders, on the other hand, are banks and other financial institutions you let you borrow the money in the form of loans. They do not become part owners, but you do need to pay the money back in time.

, You will need to contact your state government to apply for a business license/permit and to determine your business's tax status. Every state can determine its own regulations regarding business registration, but at the very least, you can expect to fill out the necessary registration forms and pay some sort of fee.

, More likely than not, you will end up renting or leasing a building rather than buying the space. Make sure that whatever building you lease is zoned for commercial purposes. If you plan on selling organic food at your organic store, make sure that the building is also zoned for food service purposes. If the building is not zoned properly, you will not be allowed to run an organic shop there.

, Most businesses do not require additional licenses. However, if organic food is a large part of your proposed stock, your state may require that you purchase a food and beverage license. These licenses can be obtained by your local department of health. You may need to go through a health inspection before you can receive one, however.

Decide if you want to start a thrift store that is a for-profit or not-for-profit business.,
Prepare and file all required documents.,
Choose a location.,
Sketch a basic floor plan and decide what type of merchandise you are going to sell in each area.,
Stock inventory to sell.,
Hire people to staff your thrift store.,
Advertise your grand opening.",How to Start a Thrift Store," There are benefits and drawbacks to each type of business so you may wish to discuss the options with a certified business planner or attorney before you decide.


Starting a for-profit thrift store business will allow more freedom in your management style and allow for larger profits. It may also mean you are eligible for fewer grants and fewer low-interest loans. Your business may not qualify for tax-exempt status even if you are donating some of the proceeds to charity.
Starting a not-for-profit thrift store may allow you to apply for free or low-cost rent, advertising and other business necessities but your day-to-day management may be inhibited by additional government regulations.;
, This may include business licenses, insurance policies and tax account status forms.

, In most cases you will be looking for existing retail space that you can rent, lease or have donated. It should have ample parking, good lighting and a display-style window where you can set up prime items to entice shoppers into the store.

, This will help you narrow down what type of display fixtures you need to purchase. You can buy them at fixtures stores or buy them from businesses that are closing.

, Most thrift stores stock gently-used, previously-owned goods with a lot of variety.


Advertise for donations to stock your store. If possible, schedule a day in each neighborhood where people who wish to donate can place items on the curb for you to pick up.
Visit bulk distribution centers where used goods can be purchased by the pound instead of per piece.
Check your local paper for storage unit auctions.
Visit yard and estate sales toward the end of the sale and offer to purchase the unsold items as a lot.

, If the hiring process seems daunting, consider going through a staffing service.

, For the best turnout on opening day, you want to start advertising heavily 2 to 4 weeks before your grand opening date. Using online sources for marketing materials, you easily and inexpensively run a marketing saturation campaign using direct mail postcards, banners and signs. The week before your grand opening date issue press releases to the local media and take out an advertisement in the local media.

Determine what types of organic goods to sell.,
Brace yourself for high start-up costs.,
Find suppliers.,
Sign contracts.,
Follow the rules.",How to Start an Organic Store2," When most people hear ""organic,"" they automatically think of organic food. Organic goods can include a range of products, though, including food, health and beauty products, cleaning products, gardening products, and even clothing. Determine what, exactly, you want your store to provide. An organic grocery store will likely focus on food and beauty products, while a general purpose organic store might have a little of everything.

, Organic goods tend to be more expensive than non-organic goods. As such, you may find that stocking your shelves the first time around is a more difficult or more costly process than you realized.

, Check out directories of organic wholesalers or contact organizations that specialize in the promotion of organic stores.Research the suppliers and double-check their reputations.

, If you are satisfied with a supplier and that supplier is equally satisfied with you, you may be able to secure a long-term contract. The benefit of a long-term contract is that you can lock in a particular price for the goods you obtain from that supplier. This can be especially important for you as the owner of an organic store since organic food prices are known to fluctuate., There are nationally set organic standards. In order to qualify as an organic business, your products must meet these standards. Become familiar with these rules and consider having your shop officially certified as organic by the Organic Trade Association.

"
"
Hire employees.,
Set reasonable prices.,
Advertise far and wide.,
Attend trade shows.",How to Start an Organic Store3," To run a store, you will need to hire employees—everyone from sales associates to cashiers to bookkeepers. You can run most of the official “behind the scenes” business yourself if you so desire, but you will need at least minimal help attending to your customers.

, Given the high cost of organic goods, it is only natural that you would expect the price of goods in your store to cost more than the price of goods in a non-organic store. That said, money talks, and if the amount of money you demand for your goods is too grating on your customers’ ears, they will buy from someone else. Gauge what your prices should be by looking at the prices set by other nearby organic stores. If no other organic stores exist nearby, then gauge how much profit a non-organic store makes on each item it sells and roughly base your pricing on that, erring on the low side when in doubt.

, Advertise online or in print. Place an ad in the newspaper, distribute flyers around town, or place signs up advertising an opening sale. If possible, consider passing around a limited number of coupons to draw potential customers into the store. Focus your efforts in areas you expect your client base to gather, including farmer's markets or other organic shops that specialize in a different type of product.

, Industry trade shows allow you to network with others in the business. These other organic entrepreneurs can give you advice, put you in contact with good suppliers, or give you an avenue to showcase your product. These trade shows also offer classes and workshops that can give you more of the knowledge you need to make your business thrive."

Wherever possible, do not dig the soil.,
Look to alternatives.,
Add as much organic matter to the soil as you can.,
Avoid some sources of organic matter.,
Make liquid feeds.,
Deal with pests and diseases.,
Encourage the wildlife.,
Grow perennial species where possible.",How to Practice Vegan Organic Horticulture," There are many reasons for this:


There are many creatures and organisms living in the soil, helping to create drainage and build up fertility. Digging the soil will kill many of these creatures and break up the natural drainage they have created.
By digging the soil you will encourage much more rapid breakdown of organic matter. Thus, if you wish to maintain the soil fertility, you will become locked into a vicious circle of having to obtain more organic matter to feed the soil whilst putting in lots of effort through your digging in order to destroy that organic matter.
Digging the soil exposes it to erosion from rain and wind. It also increases the leaching of nitrogen and other water-soluble nutrients from the soil.
Digging soil will bring weed seeds to the surface where they will quickly germinate and grow. Thus digging actually increases the need to weed.
Rather than being healthy exercise, digging is actually a great strain in the back and often leads to damage.;
, The following alternatives are excellent vegan horticultural solutions:

Mulching. If your soil is fairly weed-free, it is possible to simply apply an annual mulch, preferably in late winter or early spring, of some organic matter such as compost. Apply this about 5 centimeter (2.0 in) deep all over the ground. If your soil is lacking in humus then you will find that this dressing of organic matter will rapidly be drawn into the soil in the course of the year. Apply another mulch each succeeding year, to make a total depth of about 5 centimeter (2.0 in). As the fertility of the soil is built up, you will notice that less mulch material is required because more is left over from the previous dressing. This method of gardening does require large initial inputs of organic matter - see item 2 below for details of obtaining this.







Mulch weed-infested sites. Most organic gardeners, when confronted by a heavily weed-infested site, will reach immediately for the fork or spade and spend many hours laboriously digging out as many weeds as they can. Not only is this exceedingly hard work, but it is often far less than successful. Many of the weeds, such as couch grass or thistles, will soon regrow with renewed vigour if even small parts of the roots are left in the ground. There will also usually be an explosion of germination from literally millions of seeds that have been given ideal germination conditions. The newly-dug ground will very soon be covered in weeds again. The alternative, once more, is to mulch. But this time there must be some barrier placed below the mulch to prevent all the weeds from growing through:


Cardboard boxes are an ideal barrier to use. They are usually freely available in quantity from local shops etc. They will form an excellent barrier for a year or so, in which time most of the persistent weeds will have died, and then will rot down nicely to add their own organic matter to the fertility of the soil.
Other materials that can also be used include newspapers (but try to avoid too many with colour printing and do not use colour supplements on land where you intend to grow food) and carpets (but only those made of natural materials such as hessian - avoid foam-backed carpets).


It is very important to ensure that you apply a sufficient thickness of barrier mulch, otherwise the more vital weeds such as thistles and docks will push their way through it. A carpet that is not too worn is usually sufficient, cardboard boxes folded flat but not opened out are generally enough, and newspapers about 15 sheets thick are generally enough.
Make sure that the edges of boxes, paper or whatever overlap by at least 8 centimeter (3.1 in), otherwise the weeds will soon find their way to the surface. Late winter is the ideal time to mulch weed-infested beds, though it can be done at any time of the year so long as the soil is not dry (as well as helping to retain moisture in the soil, a mulch can also prevent moisture from reaching the soil, so a mulched dry soil will remain dry until there has been sufficient rain to soak the mulch and then penetrate into the soil). It is possible to plant into this mulched bed within three months of mulching. You simply use a trowel to make a hole into the cardboard and then plant into this hole. You may find that some weeds will start to grow out of this planting hole, but these are easily controlled by hand weeding. By using this method, it is actually possible to produce a semi-mature bed from weed-infested land by the middle of the first summer.



No-digging methods. Once you have applied a good surface mulch to your ground, how do you go about planting and sowing seeds in it? Assuming that the organic matter you have used is fairly fine (such as well- rotted compost) then you just treat this as the surface of your soil, sowing and planting directly into it. If you used a coarser material such as shredded bark or leaf mould, then seed sowing will not be very successful unless using larger seeds such as peas and beans. It is possible to grow potatoes, however, and also to plant out pot- grown plants.







, It is essential, if you want to maintain or increase the natural fertility of the soil, to make sure that you apply sufficient organic matter. Obtaining sufficient organic matter is often the most difficult aspect of organic gardening. There are several potential sources.



Garden compost. Do not waste a single scrap of organic matter in the garden or the house. Everything that once lived will rot down to provide nutrients for the soil and plants growing in the soil. There is almost never any reason to burn organic matter, the only exceptions to this being when plant matter is diseased and this disease will not or might not be destroyed in the composting process. Canker of apple trees is one example, wood infested with honey fungus is another. If you cannot obtain sufficient organic matter from your garden (and few of us can) then there are plenty of other sources to look for. Many other gardeners, for example, regularly throw out large quantities of garden waste and will be only too happy for you to collect it. Greengrocers will often let you have all the organic matter that they throw out. When activating your compost heap, consider using urine. This is an absolutely free commodity and a very valuable source of fertility that is all too often wasted. If urine does not appeal, then the heap will still rot down of its own accord, though it will take longer. You can speed it up by adding layers of nitrogen-rich material such as nettles, seaweed or young grass clippings, or you can use QR herbal activator, though this can contain honey.







Seaweed. Much of the natural fertility of the land is washed out to sea. Heavy rain, for example, will wash away soil and nutrients into the rivers and hence to the sea. Most of us regularly use flush toilets and send valuable consignments of fertility on their way to a watery grave. It therefore seems sensible to return some of this fertility to the land by using seaweed. If you live near the coast then you could collect it yourself, otherwise you can buy seaweed meal from most garden centres. Do not use calcified seaweed, see below for the reasons.







Spent hops. If you live near a brewery then you might be lucky enough to pick up large quantities of this material free. It is an excellent soil conditioner, but if possible use it in conjunction with seaweed meal or compost to improve the mineral content.







Tree leaves. Another excellent soil conditioner, it is often possible to obtain large quantities of leaves in the autumn from street trees. You might even get the work of collecting them done for you, if you have a sympathetic council or a local road-sweeper who is willing to drop off some sacks to you. Some caution is advised, however. If the leaves come from trees growing close to busy roads then they are likely to contain quite a lot of lead pollution from car exhausts.







Comfrey. Many organic gardeners grow a bed of comfrey. As well as providing a bulk of material for the compost heap, comfrey can be used as a mulch around plants, or can be placed in trenches before planting potatoes or sowing peas, beans etc. It is possible to harvest top growth several times a year, with the first harvest being available in April. Make sure you leave it in the sun for a few hours to wilt, just to make sure it does not root and become a nuisance. There are special forms of comfrey that do not set seed and so cannot become a problem in the garden. Try to obtain Blocking  14, which is available from many good organic garden suppliers.







Composted garden waste. Many councils now have recycling centres where garden waste is shredded and then composted. It is then equal in quality to most home-made composts. This material is often then bagged up and sold as a soil conditioner under various commercial names. If you are very lucky, you might find that you will be able to collect the unbagged material free, or for a very small charge, direct from the recycling centre.

Green manures. There are many plants that can be grown in order to increase the fertility of the soil. Basically you sow the seed and allow the plant to grow for some weeks before cutting it down. Many gardeners will then dig this into the soil, though it is also possible to either let it break down in situ or to remove it and compost it. A number of green manure crops, in particular the peas and beans, will enrich the soil with nitrogen as well as providing organic matter. Green manures have many benefits and can be grown as catch-crops in land that would otherwise be empty. Species to consider include buckwheat, rye, winter tares, clovers, sunflowers and alfalfa.







, Some organic matter is not recommended because it is unsustainable or polluted:

Peat. There has been a lot of publicity about peat bogs being destroyed in order to provide peat for composts, mulching etc. Please try to avoid this material if possible.







Calcified seaweed. Although it is an excellent fertilizer and soil conditioner, especially for acid soils, it is obtained from the temperate ocean equivalent of coral reefs, and is being harvested in an unsustainable way.

Spent mushroom compost. Just in case you were not aware of it, this material is usually made from animal manures, especially horse manure. It is also heavily polluted with all the chemicals they use in growing mushrooms.

Coir. This is being used in increasing quantities as a peat replacement. We feel that, although this is an excellent soil conditioner, it should be left in the countries where it grew in order to improve the fertility of their soils.







, Most, if not all, plants benefit from being given concentrated feeds during the growing season. Annuals, especially, benefit because they do not have the established root system of perennials. It is possible to buy vegan liquid feeds or you can make your own. The process is simple. You fill a container, perhaps a dustbin, with plant material, pushing it in tightly to get as much in as possible. You then fill the container with water (and you will be surprised how much water will fit in) and leave it for a week or two. It will by then be very smelly, and you dilute it by perhaps 10 - 1 with water and then pour it on the soil around the plants. Alternatively, you can spray it over the leaves of plants, preferably in the evening or on cloudy days. Some possible materials to use include:



Seaweed. You can either collect the seaweed from the beach, or buy liquid seaweed from garden centres. Very rich in a wide range of minerals, it is an excellent general feed.

Comfrey. A very good source of potassium, it is especially good for potatoes and tomatoes. Nettles. Rich in most minerals, and also providing some nitrogen, it is a good general feed. Weeds. Just using a mixture of garden weeds will provide a good general-purpose feed.

, There are many organic sprays available for treating pests and diseases in plants. In general, these should be weapons of last resort since they will also kill other creatures, many of which are very beneficial in the garden. If you feel it is essential to use such materials, then you will need to read up on which material is best to use. A read of a good catalogue from an organic supplier will often be sufficient guide. There are also various sprays that can be made from plants growing in the garden. In general, you have to be very knowledgeable before using these, since they are often more harmful to wildlife than the sprays you can buy. If you want to consider alternatives to spraying, then the following are some options:

Chamomile and garlic. Add a crushed garlic clove and a small handful of chamomile flowers to half a litre of water that has just been boiled. Cover and leave to soak for 12 hours. This will make an excellent tonic for plants that will help them to fight pests and diseases.







Mixed and companion planting. Pests and diseases spread much more easily when lots of plants of the same species are growing together. Try to mix your plants more - you will find that this will also help to produce higher overall yields from your ground. By planting aromatic plants amongst your other plants you will find that the incidence of pests and diseases will fall. Camomile, garlic and many of the Mediterranean herbs are very useful here.

Encourage the wildlife. There are many creatures who would love to be able to share your garden with you, and who would repay you by eating many of the pests in your garden. Put n a pond, for example, and any frogs who live in it will eat up lots of slugs. Hedgehogs and slow worms will also eat their fair share of slugs and snails. Thrushes are also useful here, though they will also want to share your fruit with you.

Biological control. There are now many companies who supply parasitic creatures that you can introduce into your garden or greenhouse to control pests. I do have some reluctance to use these, especially if they are not native species. However, these parasites are very specific to the pest they are intended to control, and are therefore much safer in the environment than organic sprays.

Gardening techniques. There are many little tricks you can use in order to reduce the incidence of pests and diseases. Leaving the main carrot sowing until early June, for example, will reduce the risk of root fly. Laying rhubarb leaves on the ground will attract slugs to shelter there - it is then a simple matter to collect the slugs up and move them on to wherever you want to move them. Any good book on organic gardening will include many of these techniques. It is very important to try to be as tidy as possible in the garden. Leaving things lying around, for example, will give slugs a place to shelter. Great if you are prepared to check all these places each day - but not if you have just been lazy and are not prepared to check. If you do get a disease in the garden, then try to treat it as soon as possible. Remove the diseased material, burning it if absolutely necessary.

, This article has already mentioned the value of wildlife in the garden for helping to control pests and diseases. It is also important that we all try to provide suitable conditions for native creatures in order to counteract to some extent all the habitat destruction that is or has taken place in this country. There is a very large area of land taken up by gardens and allotments and these can provide a wonderful habitat for a wide range of creatures. Encouraging wildlife is not about putting out scraps of food each day for the birds, or putting out a bag of peanuts on a bird table. Whilst it might be lovely to watch the tits feeding, what you are actually doing is making the creatures dependent on you for their food. If you should stop feeding, perhaps because you move house, then these creatures will have lost their food source and might die. It is better to provide a more permanent and natural source of food by planting appropriate plants. There are many fruit-producing trees and shrubs, for example, that will supply food for the birds and various other creatures. Many other plants will provide nectar and pollen for bees and butterflies. A pond will attract a very wide range of insects, amphibians and other creatures. Grow a wildflower meadow and you will be surprised at just how many butterflies and moths will come along to say thank you - and you will also probably be treated to the sight of swallows swooping low over the grass to catch some of the insects that will abound there. Wherever possible, choose native species for wild-life plantings, though there are many non-natives such as buddleia and cotoneasters that would also be very useful.

, The gardening world, especially when it comes to growing food, has become besotted with annual crops. These are much harder work to grow simply because you have to be preparing seed beds, sowing seeds, weeding etc every year if you want your crops. There are plenty of alternative perennial food crops available. These are much easier to grow - once established they will come back of their own accord year after year. They can also be much more productive - especially if grown in mixed plantings of complimentary plants.
