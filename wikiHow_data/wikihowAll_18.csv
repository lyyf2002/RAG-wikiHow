Drink plenty of water not only to keep yourself hydrated but to also create a natural glow in your skin.,
Insert at least thirty minutes of exercise into your daily agenda.,
Wear flowing outfits, such as maxi skirts.,
Although some ice cream princesses may prefer to wear makeup to cover any blemishes and/or create an unnatural glow, avoid wearing makeup no matter what.,
Let your hair be natural, similar to the step about makeup.",How to Be an Ice Cream Princess2," The recommended amount of water includes eight glasses of water per day. Vegetables and fruits make up two glasses, but remember that you still need those six glasses of water in order to have a wonderful complexion!


Note that having a glowing complexion isn't mandatory, but consider it as an added bonus if you manage to achieve it. Keep in mind that while you may not notice the changes in your complexion and/or the glow, others may. Don't get frustrated and give up - remember that this is best for your health.

, Keep in mind that eating all of that ice cream - including any toppings that you might use - means an increase of calories, not including any other snacks and meals you might consume throughout the day. Some of the calories that come into your body must be burned to avoid weight gain. Also, a healthy ice cream princess wins over an unhealthy ice cream princess!

, Pleasant tank tops, T-shirts that include ice cream graphics on them, and shrugs are recommended as well. Your shoes should consist of either flip-flops or ballet flats, but you can purchase both if you wish. Remember that ice cream princesses glow with creativity in their style. Therefore, avoid sticking to one color all the way. Find colors that complement your skin tone and body type and wear them all! Each color is unique in its own way, but keep in mind that not all of them might match you.


If you have trouble finding the right style and color for you, ask your parents or a sales clerk at a store for help and advice. You could also get a friend's recommendation for extra bonus.

, Despite the fact that all your friends may be wearing it, ice cream princesses should appear as natural as possible. You are beautiful in your own way - you don't need makeup to look nice! While makeup may make you feel beautiful, it doesn't necessarily give you a beautiful appearance. People normally find themselves drawn to natural girls, and if you're a natural girl, you're on your way to become an even better ice cream princess.


When you find yourself longing for makeup, remember this: Be natural like almonds.

, Avoid applying any heat to it, which includes curling and straightening it. Not only will heat damage your hair, but you aren't letting yourself be as natural as possible. Although this step isn't mandatory, refrain from torturing your hair into beautiful, twisted designs that may harm it in the future. Instead, wear your hair in natural, beautiful styles that will not only keep it shiny and glowing with health but also complement your face shape and gorgeous outfit. However, don't feel inclined to follow this step if you know it's not you.


If you're the type that enjoys crazy styles, try styling your hair into an afro or wild braids.

Have a kind and blissful (happy and joyful) attitude.,
Twist words to match your ice cream princess personality.,
Respect your parents/guardians and be kind towards them, even if you may not like what they're telling you to do.,
Listen to any type of music you enjoy.",How to Be an Ice Cream Princess3," Make sure you practice this attitude every single day till it becomes an automatic habit for you, etched into your brain so that it'll become difficult for you to stop behaving in such a good, pleasant manner. Also, be carefree with many events that occur in your life, such as people calling you names. None of that matters when it comes to making yourself confident and happy. Remember that you should never change for other people, whether it's to impress them or simply fit in. Not only will you become fake, but you will also feel miserable rather than happy. You'll easily get tired of being the opposite of yourself.


Don't worry if acting kind and blissful feels awkward at first because it'll soon feel natural once you get used to it. By then, people should know you for your pleasant manner.
Be cautious when it comes to being carefree. You should know when to be serious in certain situations; otherwise, you may unintentionally hurt others and perhaps even lose relationships that may be important to you.

For example: Be carefree when people laugh at your mistakes, but quickly lose that attitude when a friend's family member dies.



, For example, you could say ""Sprinkle-riffic"" instead of ""terrific"". You could also exclaim, ""Dippin' dots!"" rather than use the word ""Wow!"" Not only will it sound cute and humorous to people, but it'll also be fun to say. Be creative when it comes to changing words to go your way, but make sure you don't turn them into bad words.


Keep in mind that some people may find you annoying when you change words like that, but never change for them. However, if you feel uncomfortable saying words as mentioned above, don't feel forced to follow this step. Do only what's comfortable for you, but don't forget to be adventurous rather than uptight and stiff. Have a little fun with yourself, but not to the point that you hurt yourself and/or others!

, Although you may believe that they don't want you to have any fun, keep in mind that they're only thinking of the best for you. Obey them while you're still under their care, and remember that they won't always be around so make good, happy memories with them. Tell yourself that they are the King and Queen, while you are the ice cream princess!

, Ice cream princesses should listen to Nightcore music while keeping in mind that it isn't evil or bad. Actually, it's known as ""Hardcore Happiness."" Nightcore basically consists of songs from songs that people hear today. However, the music is faster while the beat and voices are more high. Despite the fact that some ice cream princesses may enjoy it, you don't have to listen to it if you don't like it. When listening to music, make sure you choose only songs with clean lyrics. Be sure that the songs have no bad intentions hidden behind the words because ice cream princesses should be pure and not listen to any bad songs.

Moisten a clean washcloth.,
Microwave the bagged washcloth.,
Use a kettle as an alternative.,
Be careful when handling the plastic bag.,
Seal the washcloth into the bag.,
Wrap the plastic bag in a clean towel.,
Place the wrapped compress against your skin.",How to Make a Warm Compress2," Run water over the washcloth until it’s saturated with water. It should be dripping wet. Then place the cloth in a resealable plastic bag (like a Ziploc bag). Fold the cloth neatly to ensure it will heat up evenly when you put it in the microwave. Do not seal the bag yet at this point.

, With the bag left open, place the bag and towel in the center of the microwave. Heat on high for 30–60 seconds, adding time in 10 second increments until it reaches the temperature you’re looking for.

, If you don’t have a microwave or feel uncomfortable microwaving plastic, you can simply heat some water up in a kettle on the stovetop. Place the washcloth into a bowl and pour the boiling water over the washcloth. Then use tongs to insert it into the plastic bag.


You can also apply the warm cloth directly to your skin if you want to get some moist heat, but you must be extremely careful that the compress is not too hot. This type of warm compress is helpful for sinus pain, but be aware of the risk of burns., Because the washcloth was saturated in water, there may be scalding hot steam coming from the plastic bag. Exercise caution when removing the bag and washcloth from the microwave to prevent burns — hot steam can seriously burn the skin even if you don’t get direct contact with the hot object.Use a pair of kitchen tongs to handle the materials if they’re too hot to touch.

, When you’ve microwaved the wet washcloth to your ideal temperature, you want to seal the steam and heat into the bag to prevent it from cooling too rapidly. Again, be careful not to burn yourself — steam can cause severe burns and it is absolutely essential that you protect yourself. Cover your fingertips with another washcloth or a pair of oven mitts to protect your skin when sealing the bag.

, You don’t want to apply the hot plastic directly to your skin, so use a clean towel as a protective barrier. Place the plastic bag in the center of the towel, then fold the towel around the heated material. Do so in a way that prevents the bag from sliding out of the towel, and only leaves a single layer of towel between the heat and your skin.

, Allow the compress to cool if it feels uncomfortably warm. Remember to give your skin a break from the heat every ten minutes, and don’t apply the compress for longer than 20 minutes.


If your skin starts to look dark red, purplish, spotty red and white, blistered, swollen or you develop hives, call your doctor. You may have skin damage from the heat."

Apply heat to sore muscles.,
Use moist heat to treat muscle spasms.,
Treat joint stiffness and arthritis pain with either heat or cold.,
Avoid heat therapy if you suffer from certain conditions.,
Do not use heat for acute injuries.Heat is best used to treat chronic issues, like ongoing muscle soreness, spasming, or chronic joint pain.",How to Make a Warm Compress3," Sore muscles are often the result of excessive lactic acid buildup in the muscle tissue.When you use a warm compress on a sore muscle, the heat draws more blood to that area.The increased circulation flushes away excessive lactic acid, making your muscles feel less sore. It also brings more oxygen to the area, speeding up the healing process for damaged tissue. The warm sensation can distract the nervous system, decreasing the amount of pain signals sent to the brain., If you experience prolonged muscle spasms, your first step is to rest the affected muscle. Take it easy, and avoid the activity that stressed your muscle to the point of spasm in the first place. Wait 72 hours to apply heat, letting any inflammation in the area diminish. After the three days have passed, apply a moist warm compress to the affected area to speed up the healing process., Both methods can be effective in treating joint issues, though some people prefer one over the other. You might try alternating between the two until you figure out which one works better for you.


Cold ice packs numb the soreness you feel and reduce inflammation and swelling in your joints by constricting your blood vessels. Though extreme cold can uncomfortable at first, it’s very useful for numbing acute pain.
Warm compresses dilate the blood vessels, increasing blood flow that speeds up the healing process. The heat also loosens the tissues and ligaments in the stiff area, increasing their range of movement.You can also apply heat by soaking the affected area in warm water. This might mean swimming in a heated pool or simply soaking in a warm bath.

, Pregnancy, diabetes, poor circulation, and heart disease (like high blood pressure) can respond poorly to heat therapy. Talk to your doctor before using a warm compress to ease muscle or joint pain.You should always keep a layer of cloth between the heat source and your skin to prevent burns.

, Cold, on the other hand, is better for use immediately after an acute injury like a sprained joint. So, if you pull a muscle, apply ice immediately to reduce the swelling within the first 48 hours. If the pain persists for several days, use heat to speed up the recovery process.

"
"
Run water from the tap until it is hot.,
Find a towel that is large enough to cover your injury.,
Place the towel under the running water and allow it to become saturated with water.,
Heat your whole body.Rather than making a compress for a specific area of your body, if you have multiple sore muscles or your whole body is sore after a grueling working heating your whole body can be an effective way for pain relief (and it can also speed up your post-workout recovery time).,
Take precautions.,
Understand why heat can be soothing and help to ease muscle pain.,
Try other options.",How to Make A Simple Hot Compress for Muscle Pain1," You may want to heat water on the stove or in the microwave, but you have more chance of burning yourself if you heat the water in this way. Instead, run the hot water from your sink to a temperature that is just hot enough for you to tolerate.
, Fold a towel or washcloth to cover only the area you want to place the compress on., Test the towel to make sure it isn't too hot to place on your skin. Then, place it on the affected region.

Leave the towel on for 20 minutes or so, up to three times a day, until your soreness improves.

, Options include:


Have a hot bath.
Have a hot shower.
Go in a hot tub.
Go in a steam room.
Go in a sauna.

, If you are treating sore muscles with heat on a regular basis, it is important to take the following precautions:


Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water (at least 8 cups a day). Prolonged exposure to heat can cause dehydration so it's important to drink ample water.Be careful not to burn yourself. Check the temperature of the hot towel before using or, if you are using a heating pad or hot water bottle, you should wrap it in a towel or cloth prior to use to ensure you do not burn your skin.Check your skin for blistering. If this occurs, or you experience pain, remove the compress. Your body will generally tell you when things are too hot.

, Heat helps your sore muscle(s) to relax by stimulating the blood flow to the area and diminishing muscle spasms.Muscle pain commonly occurs in over-worked muscles due to the build-up of something called lactic acid.Lactic acid is a metabolic by-product of challenging workouts (or challenging sports games), and you need to increase the blood flow to the sore muscle in order to clear the lactic acid out.Note that if you have chronically sore muscles, heat prior to working out (or prior to a sports event) can help to ease any pain you may feel during the activity itself., If you have a heating pad at home, or a hot water bottle, these can be quick and effective ""home remedies"" for sore muscles.If you find that you have sore muscles regularly, you may want to invest in a heating pad or a hot water bottle to avoid having to make your own hot compress with a towel and hot water every time.

"
"
Use an anti-inflammatory cream or gel.Rub it on the sore muscle(s) following exercise.,
Try topical capsaicin.,
See your doctor.",How to Make A Simple Hot Compress for Muscle Pain2," Examples include Bengay or Voltaren. Ask your doctor or local pharmacist for other suggestions.


Pay attention to dosage. Even though these are topical treatments, they can be absorbed systemically, and dosage needs to be acknowledged and followed.
Be careful not to apply medicated creams to broken or damaged skin.
See your physician if your pain persists longer than a couple of weeks after trying these topical treatments.

, This is derived from hot chili peppers, and can serve as an effective pain-killer.When you first apply capsaicin to your skin, it may have a tingling or slight burning sensation.Do not worry as this is to be expected.


Note that capsaicin may take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks (applied once daily) to become effective in terms of pain relief.If you are going to try this method, stick to it for this time frame before coming to any conclusions about whether or not it works for you.

, If you do not notice improvement of your muscle pain within a week or two following the onset of muscle soreness, it is important to have a proper assessment from your physician or physiotherapist (someone who is experienced at diagnosing more severe athletic injuries).


If there is something more serious going on, you will want to know about it sooner than later so that you can treat the injury properly before it gets any worse.

Nymphs are energetic and active.,
Nymphs are graceful, fluid beings.,
Be tough.,
Be intelligent and creative.,

Stay deeply in touch with nature.",How to Be Like a Warrior Nymph (Fantasy)," eg: Forest nymph, water nymph, dark nymph, you can even be a city nymph! It doesn't matter, adapt it to your situation, personal style and preference.;
, For example: If a water nymph appeals to you, make the effort to go swimming, learn about the sea, meditate on the sound of the waves, become the actual nature of the water element. The more comfortable you are with your element the better. It can be quite helpful in certain situations to know a specific environment in depth. Similarly it makes you a more observant and intuitive person.

, Nymphs come in all shapes and sizes but you do need to make sure that you maintain a healthy strong body. Eat plenty of fruit and veg, eat whole foods such as brown rice and quinoa. Drink plenty of water or fresh fruit juice to hydrate yourself. Nymphs have strength and stamina and a good diet will support this, but hey, life is for living, allow yourself a treat once in a while!

, Try aerobic workouts to burn fat and muscle workouts to tone and refine. Ballet is a great way to gain strength while still maintaining a refined shape. Because nymphs are always running around in complete control of their environment, it maybe a good idea to look into gymnastics or parkour, something where you can be flexible, like yoga.

, Make sure you maintain a good posture, learn to control your body's movement, considering footwork and balance.

, Just because you're graceful does not mean you can't pack a punch! Try out archery or self defense, become in control of your own strength.

, If you are a forest nymph it can be quite difficult climbing trees in tight leather hot pants!

, Nymphs are spiritual beings, aware of their environment, it is an essential part of their character.

, Search through everything that comes up, and save anything that inspires you to a file on your computer.

, Which styles did you like best? This is how you know where to start with your new style. Once you have a basic understanding of the concept, then you can start to add your own flair.

, Now that you have researched and gotten inspired, the real fun begins...

, Long is usually best. Go for big, wavy, princess-y curls... with a twist! Add in a couple tiny braids here and there, or even a streak of color. You could even make your hair a totally unique version of your favorite princess's hairstyle.

, Start with your basic foundation, concealer, powder for a base. Add a little bit of blush if you want a sweeter look. Smear on heavy black liner. You can never have too much eyeliner! Add a couple tons of lengthening mascara, and finish off with a dash of a light, pale lip balm or gloss.

, Find a style that you love and roll with it! The only rule to being an artistic princess is: NO RULES. That means no looking like a vanilla, goody-two-shoes prep. If you like polos and Lacoste, by all means, go for it- just layer it with an unraveling black cardigan, tight miniskirt, and crazy tights. Make sure you own some sweet boots, like Doc Martens, and at least one pair rockin' heels. Wear skinny jeans and skirts, a lot of dark or gray colors, and awesome jewelry. Neon is great in small doses. Always look like you don't try- like you just roll out of bed or offstage. Maybe do a grunge look everyday! Mix the princess style with your own, funky, artistic style.

A reading nook with a TV/stereo, bookshelf, and comfy chair is always awesome.
A beautiful, antique desk with a nice lamp is great for studying.
A dresser vanity with a mirror, along with a full-length mirror (or two). Have tons of your beauty products spilled out over your dresser top, along with your jewelry, for a cool boho effect.
And of course, a comfy bed, made up with tons of warm, fuzzy blankets and pillows.

, Now that you have all of your new duds, you need to organize them efficiently so you can actually see what pieces you have and flaunt them! Set it up like a little boutique- tank tops here, sweaters there, arrange your T-shirts by color, etc.

, A great, studded handbag in a cool print is perfect. Even a cool backpack will do for something like a concert, sleepover, or the beach!

, You want to be artistic? Go out there and do it! Paint, sketch, take photos, write stories, start a video blog, knit, make movies, embroider your clothes- whatever you love, as long as it's creative!

, Be nice to your friends, and people you're just meeting. But seriously, if you go to school with a lot of ignorant,annoying, mean people- you can be mean right back at them! Be tough, and don't care about what other people think. You're a strong, independent woman- are you going to let anyone push you around?

, Make art. Love your art. Be proud of it. Always be creative- don't lose sight of what you love to do!

Determine responsiveness.,
Check for breathing and a pulse.If unconscious and unable to be roused, check for breathing: look for a rise in the chest area; listen for the sound of air coming in and out; feel for air using the side of your face.,
If the person remains unresponsive, prep for CPR.,
Perform 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths as part of CPR.,
Remember your ABCs of CPR.,
Make sure the person is warm as you wait for medical help.,
Pay attention to a list of don'ts.",How to Do Basic First Aid2," If a person is unconscious, try to rouse them by speaking to them; do not be afraid to speak up. If they do not respond to activity, sound, touch, or other stimulation, determine whether they are breathing.

, If no signs of breathing are apparent, place two fingers under the chin and gently guide the face pointing upwards to open up their airways. If any debris such as vomit can be seen, it is appropriate to move them onto their side to allow it to get out, which is achieved with the recovery position.Check for a pulse.

, Unless you suspect a spinal injury, carefully roll them onto their back and open their airway.If you suspect a spinal injury, leave the person where they are, provided they are breathing.Keep the head and neck aligned.
Carefully roll them onto their back while holding their head.
Open the airway by lifting the chin.

, In the center of the chest, just below an imaginary line running between the nipples, put your two hands together and compress the chest down approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) at a rate of 100 compressions per minute (or to the beat of ""Staying Alive""). After 30 compressions, give two rescue breaths, done by opening the airways, closing the nose and fully covering the mouth hole. Then check vitals. If the breaths are blocked, reposition the airway. Make sure the head is tilted slightly back and the tongue is not obstructing it. Continue this cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until someone else relieves you., The ABCs of CPR refer to the three critical things you need to look for.Check these three things frequently as you give the person first aid CPR.


Airway. Does the person have an unobstructed airway?
Breathing. Is the person breathing?
Circulation. Does the person show a pulse at major pulse points (wrist, carotid artery, groin)?

, Drape a towel or a blanket over the person if you have one; if you don't, remove some of your own clothing (such as your coat or jacket) and use it as a cover until medical help arrives. However if the person has a heatstroke, do not cover him or keep him warm. Instead try to cool him by fanning him and damping him.

, As you administer first aid, be sure to be aware of these things that you should not do in any case:


Do not feed or hydrate an unconscious person. This could cause choking and possible asphyxiation.
Do not leave the person alone. Unless you absolutely need to signal or call for help, stay with the person at all times.
Do not prop up an unconscious person's head with a pillow.
Do not slap or splash with water an unconscious person's face. These are movie gimmicks.
If the person appears in danger due to an electric shock, you may attempt to move it, but only with a non-conductive object.

Treat a Spinal Injury Victim.",How to Do Basic First Aid3," Bloodborne pathogens can threaten your health and wellbeing by causing sickness and disease. If you have a first aid kit, sanitize your hands and put on sterile gloves. If sterile gloves and sanitizer are not available, protect your hands with extra gauze or cotton. Avoid direct contact with the other person's blood. If you do end up making contact, make sure to clean yourself off as soon as possible. Eliminate any remaining sources of contamination.

, After you have established that the victim is breathing and has a pulse, your next priority should be to control any bleeding. Control of bleeding is one of the most important things you can do to save a trauma victim. Use direct pressure on a wound before trying any other method of managing bleeding. Read the linked article for more detailed steps you can take.



Treat a bullet wound. Bullet wounds are serious and unpredictable. Read on for special considerations when treating someone who has suffered a gunshot wound.

, Shock, often caused a loss of blood flow to the body, frequently follows physical and occasionally psychological trauma. A person in shock will frequently have cool, clammy skin, be agitated or have an altered mental status, and have pale color to the skin around the face and lips. Untreated, shock can be fatal. Anyone who has suffered a severe injury or life-threatening situation is at risk for shock.

, A broken bone, however common, can be treated with the following steps:


Immobilize the area. Make sure that the broken bone doesn't have to move or support any other body parts.
Numb the pain. Often, this can be done with an ice-pack covered by a towel.

Make a splint. A bundle of newspapers and sturdy tape will do just the trick. A broken finger, for example, can also use another finger as a stabilizing splint.

Make a sling, if necessary. Tie a shirt or a pillowcase around a broken arm and then around the shoulder.

, Choking can cause death or permanent brain damage within minutes. Read this article for ways to help a choking victim. The article addresses helping both children and adult choking victims.


One of the ways to help a choking victim is the Heimlich maneuver. The Heimlich maneuver is performed by straddling the victim from behind and bear-hugging them with your hands interlocked above their belly-button but beneath their breastbone. Thrust upward to expel air from the lungs and repeat until you are successful in clearing the object from the windpipe. IF THIS WORKS, THE PERSON WILL NEED TO VISIT THE HOSPITAL QUICKLY, INTERNAL BLEEDING CAN BE CAUSED WITH THIS METHOD.

, Treat first- and second-degree burns by immersing or flushing with cool water for at least 10 minutes (no ice). Don't use creams, butter or other ointments, and do not pop blisters. Third degree burns should be covered with a damp cloth. Remove clothing and jewelry from the burn, but do not try to remove charred clothing that is stuck to burns.

, If the victim has suffered a blow to the head, look for signs of concussion. Common symptoms include:


Loss of consciousness following the injury
Disorientation or memory impairment
Vertigo
Nausea
Lethargy.

, If you suspect a spinal injury, it is especially critical that you not move the victim's head, neck or back unless they are in immediate danger. You also need to take special care when performing rescue breathing or CPR. Read this article to learn what to do.

Help someone who is having a seizure.,
Help someone survive a heart attack.,
Identify someone having a stroke.,
Treat poisoning.",How to Do Basic First Aid4," Seizures can be scary things for people who've never experienced them before. Luckily, helping people with seizures is relatively straightforward.


Clear the surroundings to protect the person from hurting themselves.Activate emergency medical services if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes or if the person is not breathing afterwards.
After the episode has ended, help them to the floor and and put something soft or flat under their head. Turn them onto their side to ease breathing, but do not hold the person down or try to stop their movements.
Be friendly and reassuring as their consciousness returns and do not offer food or water until fully alert.

, It helps to know the symptoms of heart attack, which include rapid heartbeat, pressure or pain in the chest, and general unease or nausea. Rush the person to the hospital immediately while giving them an aspirin or a nitroglycerin, which the person should chew.

, Again, knowing the symptoms of stroke is important. They include temporary inability to talk or understand what is being said; confusion; loss of balance or dizziness; and severe headache with no precursor, among others. Rush a person you suspect has had a stroke to the emergency room immediately.

, Poisoning can occur as a result of natural toxins (i.e. snake bite) or chemical combinations. If an animal may be responsible for poisoning, try to (safely) kill it, bag it, and bring it with you to poison control.

Know the limits of your lift and sling.",How to Use a Hoyer Lift1," The lift should have two ""legs"" parallel to the floor, supported by four wheels. These need to be stable at all times, so make sure the wheels are tightly attached and do not use the Hoyer lift on uneven floors.;
, A vertical spreader handle (or shifter handle) next to the main column of the lift can be pulled to move the legs further apart or bring them back together. The handle should lock into a slot to keep the legs from moving once they reach the proper position.


Some models may have a foot pedal instead of a spreader handle.
Always lock the legs to their widest position before lifting a patient, and as long as the patient remains in the lift. Failing to do so could cause the lift to fall over.

, At the top of the Hoyer lift is a long, angled bar called the boom. At the end of this boom hangs a four-pronged sling bar, also known as a swivel bar.. This has four or more hooks for attaching the sling that will hold the patient.

, There are two types of Hoyer lifts: manual (or hydraulic) and powered (or electric). The only difference between these types of lift is the method used to raise or lower the boom. Manual lifts have a pump handle which must be moved up and down repeatedly to raise the boom, whereas battery powered lifts have simple ""Up"" and ""Down"" arrows to control the boom.Find the small control valve at the base of a manual lift's pump handle. When the control valve is positioned toward the pump handle, the valve is closed. The valve must be in this position in order for the pump to work when elevating the boom. Keep pumping until the boom locks into place.When the control valve is positioned away from the pump handle, the valve is open. Gently move the control valve from the closed to the open position to control the rate at which the boom lowers.

, In case of power failure, most electric patient lifts have an emergency release control, which mechanically lowers the patient. Know where this is located and how to operate it. Some models have an inset button which requires a pen to reach, but you should check your lift's manual for specifics.


Manual lifts do not have an emergency release, since the lift is controlled by human power rather than a battery with a limited lifespan.
There may be two or more emergency releases on your model. Know which is the primary release, and which should only be attempted if the first fails.

, U-slings are the easiest and quickest to use, and are appropriate for users that can sit up, even slightly. Lifting with a full body sling, or hammock sling, takes more time but is required for users that cannot sit up on their own.U-slings are shaped roughly like the letter U, with two long extensions running parallel to each other. They are often padded for greater comfort.
A full body or hammock sling is one large piece, sometimes with a commode hole.
Use a sling that provides head and neck support for users who cannot support their own neck.
Make sure the sling you use is appropriate to your model of lift. Contact the manufacturer to ask if necessary.
Use the advice of a physician to select a sling that is the right size and type for each user, and make it their personal sling.

, Tears, loose stitching, or worn loops could cause the sling to break mid transfer, possibly injuring yourself or the user. These slings are sturdy, but you should check before each transfer just in case the sling needs to be replaced., Different slings come with a variety of ways to attach them to the sling hooks of the lift, including chains, straps, and loops. Familiarize yourself with these attachment points, using the owner's manual or an experienced user to guide you.


If using a sling with hooks, attach them so the open side of the hook points away from the user, to prevent injury.Understand which side of the sling the patient should sit on, and which is the outside. Consult an expert or the manufacturer if unsure.

, The Hoyer lift does most of the work for you, but you will still need to move the user in and out of the sling. You should follow safe lifting practices to minimize risk of injury. All the tips that apply to lifting furniture or other heavy objects apply here as well.


Use your legs to provide strength and stability. Place them apart and bend at the knees before lifting.
Keep your back as straight as possible while lifting.
Do not twist your body as you lift. Position yourself directly in front of where the patient is going so you do not need to rotate your torso halfway through lifting.

, Follow these instructions several times using an empty Hoyer lift, then practice on a volunteer who has full mobility. Be familiar with each step before you try to perform a transfer on the intended user, especially alone.


If possible, perform your transfers with an assistant who also knows how to operate the lift. Many hospitals require two people to operate the lift even if they are experienced operators, to reduce the chance of injury

, Consult the owner's manual or contact the manufacturer to find out how much weight your model of lift and sling can support. Never attempt to lift a user too heavy for the lift or sling. Always use the correct sling for the user's needs, as described above.


Ask about a new user's mobility before lifting so you know how much they can contribute to the movement.
Use your best judgement when asked to lift a user who makes sudden involuntary movements, has a hostile attitude, or could otherwise cause injury to one or both of you. Refuse if necessary rather than endangering yourself and the user.

Explain each step of the procedure to the user.,
If using a hospital bed, keep the guard rails up and locked whenever they don't interfere with your access.,
Raise the bed to maximum flat height if possible.,
Have the user lie on their back near the side you will be placing the lift.,
Remove any excess blankets or sheets from the top of the patient.,
Have the user raise the leg nearest you.,
Roll the user onto the side opposite you.,
Fold the sling in half lengthwise and place it next to the user.,
Roll the user onto their back and then onto their other side.,
Tug gently at the top layer of the folded sling.,
Roll the user onto their back, over the sling.,
Lock the lift into position under the user's bed.,
Lower the boom until the sling bar is over the patient.,
Hook the loops on the sides of the u-sling to the cradle.,
Raise the boom slowly.,
Roll the lift with the sling and user in place slowly to the new destination.,
Lower the boom until the user is positioned comfortably.,
Unhook the sling loops and remove the sling.",How to Use a Hoyer Lift2," Explain to the user what you are going to do before each action, and why you are doing it. Let them know the reason for the transfer if they did not request it, and involve them in every step of the process. Besides showing them respect, this will let them aid you in the process when they are able.

, You will need to move from one side of the bed to the other several times if you do not have an assistant, but make sure to raise and lock the guard rail each time before leaving a side. It's fine to temporarily lower the rail if it gives you better access to the user when assisting them into the sling.


Once the sling is attached to the Hoyer lift, raise and lock the guard rails again before lifting. The user may wish to hold onto the guard rails for stability as the lifting begins.

, If you are using a bed that can elevate while remaining flat, elevate it to the maximum height you can comfortably work on. The higher it is, the less strain will be put on your back when you assist the user.

, For single and twin beds, they should lie in the center. If they are on a queen bed or other large bed, they should lie nearer the side you will transfer them from.


The user should not be on the extreme edge of the bed.

, Place any objects that could get in the way of the transfer on another surface or near the base of the bed. Straighten the patient's clothing or gown.

, Raise the knee next to you and place the user's foot flat on the bed. Tell them that you will be rolling them onto one side and the raise knee will make it easier.

, Gently hold the raised knee and the opposite shoulder of the user, then carefully push them onto their side, facing away from you.If the user cannot stay on their side without support, place a rolled up towel or similar soft object behind their back to wedge them in place. Alternatively, have an assistant gently hold them in place.

, The bottom end should be just above the user's knees and the top end should be just above the user's armpits.Make sure that the loops and tabs are on the inside when you fold.


Make sure the fold of the sling is next to the user, with the open side facing away from them.

, Using the same rolling techniques, roll the user over until they are on their other side, on top of the folded sling.


Move to the other side of the bed if you can't comfortably roll the user from the same side.
If using a wedge, remove it before rolling the user onto their back to avoid discomfort.

, Pull the sling out to unfold it, so that it lays flat across the bed.

, Arrange the user's limbs according to the construction of the sling and the user's preferences. The arms should either be straight and flat next to the body, or extended out of the way of the sling if the user wishes to place their arms outside the sling. The legs should be flat, and either together or slightly apart, according to the design of the sling.

, Check under the bed for obstructions if the lift won't fit. If you need to, narrow the legs using the shifter handle or foot pedal, but always extend them as much as you can once they are under the bed.


The sling bar should be above and parallel to the patient's shoulders.

Always lock the wheels of the lift before continuing.

, Lower it enough that the sling loops will reach the sling hooks, but not so low that it touches the patient.


If you do not know how to lower the boom, return to the section titled Familiarizing Yourself. You should always be familiar with the lift before transferring someone with limited mobility.

, There may be multiple loops behind the user's shoulders so you can choose the loop that fits most comfortably. Ask the user for their input if possible. Using straps, chains, or long sling loops, attach each corner of the sling to the correct hook on the sling bar.


For slings with leg loops, cross the leg loops under the user's legs. Make sure the left loop is reaching across to hook to the right hook, while the right loop is reaching across to hook to the left hook, and that the hooks are set away from the boom of the lift apparatus. This criss-cross helps the user's legs stay together and keeps the user from slipping out of the sling.
Some slings include a flap that can be hooked up to help support the neck and head. This detachable flap may not comfortable for those that are capable of head control.
Keep the open end of hooks facing away from the user to avoid injury.

, Make sure the loops are hooked firmly in place, and raise the boom until the patient lifts a short distance above the bed. Make sure everything is secure and comfortable before proceeding.

, Unlock the wheels of the lift and roll them carefully to the destination. You may need to adjust the width of the legs, but do not do so while the boom is being raised or lower. You should not raise or lower the boom while rolling the lift.


If you are moving to another room, slowly adjust the swivel bar so the user is facing you as you move the lift.
Position the user carefully, directly over the center of the new destination.

, If transferring to a chair or wheelchair, the user should have their hips as far back as possible.

, Only do so when the user is fully sitting or lying in the new destination. Gently remove the sling out from under the user and put it in a safe space.


Roll the patient from side to side, and fold and remove the sling if the patient is on a bed or a stretcher. Use the same rolling techniques described at the start of this section.
Tug gently upwards to slide the sling out from behind the patient if the patient is in a wheelchair or a car.

Remove the sling once the user is secure.",How to Use a Hoyer Lift3," Make sure the user knows where she is going, and that you are transferring her into the lift for this purpose. Describe each step so she knows what you are doing and can help you to the extent of her ability.

, The loops should be facing the front, and the arch of the ""u"" at the top. The ends of the ""u"" are going to criss-cross under the legs, so they need to be lowest.

, Pull the sling down between the user's back and the chair with short, tugging motions. Make sure that the end of the fabric makes it down far enough to cover the user's hips.

, The base moves on casters and becomes wider and thinner at the front below the cradle in order to be able to get closer to the user's position.


Open or close the front of the base of the lift apparatus as is appropriate in order to get the cradle directly over the user. Use a foot pedal or shifting lever on the back of the base of the lift apparatus to control the width of the legs.

Always widen the legs as much as possible before lifting.

Always lock the wheels in place before lifting.

, There may be adjustable loops for behind the user's shoulders so you can work with the user to find the most comfortable fit. Hook these loops to the hooks on the swivel bar at the end of the boom.


Cross the leg loops under the user's legs. Make sure the left loop is reaching across to hook to the right hook, while the right loop is reaching across to hook to the left hook, and that the hooks won't interfere with the motion of the boom. This criss-cross helps the user's legs stay together and keeps the user from slipping out of the sling.
Hook the flap for neck support if the user is not able to hold up their head. This flap should be left unhooked for users who cannot.

, Watch to make sure the loops are well secured. Lift until the patient is clear of the chair and check that everything is secure and comfortable before proceeding.

, Unlock the wheels and steer the lift to its new destination. Adjust the width of the wheels if necessary, but only after the boom has been raised to the correct height.


The user should be facing the mast of the lift.

, Position the user carefully so she will be comfortable and secure when you lower her into place.

, Always do this using the pump lever, for manual lifts, or the electronic controls, for powered lifts. Make sure the user is comfortable, with the hips as far back as possible if the transfer is onto another chair.

, Tug gently upwards to slid out the sling if the user is in a chair. If she is lying down, roll her gently to one side, fold the sling, then roll her to her other side to remove the folded sling.

Confirm cardiac arrest.,
Try to wake the person up.,
Call 911.,
Start CPR.,
Make sure the patient is dry.,
Turn on the AED.,
Prepare the chest area.,
Apply the pads.,
Let the AED analyze.,
Shock the victim if necessary.,
Continue CPR.",How to Use a Defibrillator," If you see a person who appears to have an emergency episode, you need to check to ensure that it is cardiac arrest before you use an AED. Check to see if the victim is unable to respond, if he is breathing, and his pulse. You can use the ABC method.If you find no pulse or breath, you need to start CPR.


Airway: You need to make sure the airway is open before you check his breathing. To do this, tilt back his head and lift up his chin.If you see an object obstructing the airway, remove it.
Breathing: Lean in closely to listen for breathing. Look to see if his chest is rising and falling.Circulation: Feel for a pulse. Signs of circulatory issues include color changes, sweating, and a lower level of consciousness.;
, If you come upon a person and you have no idea how long he has been unconscious, you need to make sure he is actually having medical problems and is not just asleep. To try to wake him up, you can shake him, yell into his ear, or try clapping near him. If he shows no signs of waking up, confirm cardiac arrest.


Never shake a child or infant. This can lead to serious injury., As soon as you assess that it is an emergency situation, you need to call 911. Explain to them where you are and what is going on. Let them know that you have an AED on site and that you plan to use it.


If there is someone else there other than you, make them call 911 while you start working on the person in need. They can also run and grab the AED from its location. This way things will get done faster, which is important with SCA., If you are not there alone, you should start giving CPR while the other person is getting the AED. If you are alone, call 911, then start CPR.


Give 30 chest compressions and then 2 rescue breaths for every 30 chest compressions. The rescue breaths should be no longer than one second. Avoid overventilation and only provide enough air to see the chest expand.
Keep chest compressions to 100 compressions per minute. Do not exceed 125 compressions per minute. You should compress the chest 2 inches (5 cm) downwards and allow it to fully expand upwards with as few interruptions as possible.
You should give CPR right away if you don't know how long a person has been unconscious, then you should use the AED., Before you turn on and use an AED, you need to make sure that the person you are helping is not wet. If they are, you need to dry them off. If there is water in the immediate area, you need to move the person to a dry place.


Water conducts electricity. If the patient is wet or if there is water nearby, he can be seriously injured., Once you are sure there is no water, you need to turn on the AED. When it comes on, it will give you instructions of how to handle the situation. It will likely tell you to attach the cables for the pads into the AED machine. You typically hook them up above the blinking light on the top of the machine.


It will also instruct you to prepare the person once the pads are plugged in., To use the AED pads, you must remove certain things from the victim. Open or cut through his shirt. If his chest is very hairy, you will have to shave it. You should also look for signs of implanted devices, such as a pacemaker. If you see any metal jewelry or accessory, remove it. The metal will conduct electricity.


Most AEDs come with a razor to shave or scissor to trim the chest of a hairy person.
You will be able to see a pacemaker or other implanted device through the chest. You can also look for a medical alert bracelet.
If the victim is a woman, you need to take off any bra that has under wire in it. It can conduct electricity just like jewelry., The electrodes for the AED are typically adhesive pads. The AED will advise you to put the electrodes or pads in place. You need to make sure that they are placed correctly so the victim will get the maximum amount of shock necessary. One pad should be placed below the collarbone on the upper right side of the victim's bare chest. The other should be placed below the peck or breast on the left, at the bottom of his heart, slightly along his side.


Make sure there is no fabric or other object between the pads and his skin. Any obstruction will make the AED malfunction.If the pads are not put on properly, the AED may repeat ""check electrodes.""
If you found an implanted device or piercing, the pads should be at least 1 inch from them., Once the pads are properly in place, you need to get everyone clear of the victim. When everyone has moved back, press the analyze button on the AED. It will begin to analyze the heart rhythm of the victim.


The AED will then tell you if a shock is needed or if you need to keep doing CPR. If no shock is needed, this means that the victim has regained a pulse or has an unshockable heart rhythm.
If there is no shock advised, you need to continue CPR until emergency workers arrive., If the AED advises that you need to shock the patient, you need to make sure, once again, that the victim is clear. Once you do, push the shock button on the AED. This will send an electric shock through the electrodes to help restart the heart.


The AED will only give one shock at a time. It doesn't last that long, but expect him to move with the force of the shock., Once you have given the victim a shock, you need to continue CPR. You should do it for 2 additional minutes and then let the AED check for a heart rhythm again. Keep this up until emergency services arrive.


You should also stop if the victim can breath on his own or if he regains consciousness.The AED will likely remind you when 2 minutes has passed and tell you to stop CPR."

Don't overdo it.",How to Use a Bulb Syringe1," Suctioning the mucus out of your infant’s nose will make it easier for him to breathe and to eat. The best time to suction your infant’s nose is before feeding him, as this will help him suck and eat. To suction your child’s nose using a bulb syringe, you will need:Saline or prescription respiratory nose drops. Ask your pediatrician for a prescription.
A clean bulb syringe
Soft tissues
A blanket (optional);
, Your hands have bacteria on them and you don't want to introduce this into your child's nose and mouth. To wash your hands properly:Wet your hands with warm water.
Lather your hands by rubbing them together with soap. Wash the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Scrub your hands for 20 seconds. If you need a timer, hum the tune of ""Happy Birthday"" two times.
Rinse your hands under clean, running water.
Dry your hands with a paper towel.

, The child's face should be facing the ceiling.You can have someone hold the infant in position gently.
If you don't have assistance, swaddle the infant tightly in a blanket. Swaddling the infant with her arms at her sides will help to keep her still.

, Keep in mind he might not like this and may squirm. Try and hold the infant still for about 10 seconds, with assistance or a swaddle. The saline will help to loosen any mucus clogging his nasal passages.You can make your own saline solution at home, but this is not recommended, especially not for an infant. If you don't get the proportions just right, the saline can be very drying. In addition, you have to make sure you have distilled, sanitized water to mix the solution.
Instead, choose one of the many commercially available saline solutions made specifically for infants. These are inexpensive and are made especially for this purpose.

, Use your thumb and first two fingers to apply pressure to the bulb syringe.

, Let it gently sit in your child’s nostril. Slowly release your thumb, letting the air come back into the bulb syringe.The suction will pull the mucus out of your child's nose and into the bulb. You may need to suction each nostril several times to remove all of the mucus. The mucus may be very thick, especially if your infant has a cold.
If the mucus is too thick to go into the bulb syringe, thin it with a few drops of saline solution and then try to suction it again, gently.

, Squeeze the mucus out of the bulb onto a paper towel or a tissue.Your child may have some mucus around the outside of her nostril. Be sure to wipe this away gently to prevent skin irritation.

, Take care to suction carefully to remove most of the mucus in your infant's nose.

, Wash the bulb syringe with warm soapy water after each use.Make sure you rinse the syringe thoroughly to prevent soap buildup in the syringe. Squeeze the bulb several times in the soapy water to clean out the mucus. Shake the inside of the bulb before squeezing it out.
Allow it to dry overnight before using it again or storing it.

, Limit suctioning your infant’s nose to four times a day to prevent irritating the lining of your infant’s nose.

Change the bandages every day and as needed intermittently.,
Recognize when you'll need medical attention.,
Wash your hands.,
Put on disposable gloves if you're treating another person.,
Have the injured person get comfortable.,
Apply pressure to stop the bleeding.,
Clean the wound.,
Dab the wound dry with a clean, disposable towel.",How to Use a Band Aid," Though you may think every wound needs a bandage, a bandage may actually be unhelpful or even harmful to certain types of wounds. In general, a cut or gash that is not very deep will benefit from a bandage, while other types of wounds will require different treatment approaches.Keeping minor scratches, scrapes, and cuts clean might be sufficient, and you may be able to leave them uncovered. This will allow the wound to remain dry and begin to heal.Deep or wide wounds may need to be sealed by a medical professional. These injuries may require stitches, staples, or other special medical dressings.
Some injuries may heal best with hospital glue, like Dermabond, which seals the wound shut. You should never use household glue, though, as this is unsafe and may further injure the wound.;
, After cleaning your wound with soap and water, use a small dab of antibiotic cream or ointment to help disinfect the wound and keep the wound from drying out. You won't need much antibiotic. Spread the small dab evenly across the wound until a thin layer covers the entire site of the injury., There are many different types of dressings and bandages that can be used for a wound. Some factors to consider when choosing a bandage include the size/shape of the wound, the nature of the wound, and any allergies the injured person might have.


Standard adhesive bandages are best for small or superficial cuts, and they come in a number of shapes and sizes. They may not be helpful for deep cuts, long cuts, or jagged wounds with uneven edges.
You can also buy adhesive bandages that are water-resistant, latex-free, and in special shapes to cover oddly-formed wounds.
Cloth bandages and dressings like gauze can also be used for wounds that are bleeding excessively.
Steri-strips can be left on an injury for up to 10 days or until they fall off on their own.Hospital glue is quick and painless. It remains on the wound for one to two weeks, and by the time it peels off the wound will have healed.

, Bandages come in many shapes and sizes. Before you dress a wound, it's important to size up the injury and look through the bandages on hand to find one that will adequately cover the injury. If the bandage is too small it won't effectively protect the wound. If it's too big, it might hinder movement or end up soaking up water or dirt as the injured person moves and goes about their day.

, Be very careful as you unwrap the bandage. Pre-packaged bandages are sterile, and it's important that they remain sterile when you apply them to a wound. Be very careful as you peel off the backing on the adhesive strips, and only touch the sticky parts. Do not touch the sterile cloth center with your hands.


Try to center the sterile cloth in the middle of the bandage directly over the deepest part of the wound.
If the wound is long, you can use multiple bandages to keep it covered.
If the wound is a minor scrape or scratch, it's actually best to avoid bandages and simply leave it uncovered., A bandage keeps dirt and bacteria out of your wound, which means the bandage will inevitably get soiled throughout the day. It may also soak up some blood if your wound starts to bleed again. Generally speaking, you should take the bandages off and leave the wound uncovered at night so it can breathe (each would is different, however, and it might need coverage at night as well). Then cover the wound with clean bandages every morning, and keep some extras with you in case the bandages you're wearing get wet or dirty., It's easy to bandage a simple wound at home, but some injuries require further medical attention. Any wound that is gaping, jagged, or shows exposed fat/muscle under the skin will need stitches as soon as possible. You should also have a medical professional assess the wound to evaluate your risk of infection.Only a doctor or nurse can stitch a wound. If you get a wound stitched up within a few hours of the injury, it will reduce the risk of infection and make the scars (if any) very minimal.
If you (or the injured individual) have not had a tetanus shot within the last five years and the injury was caused by a dirty or rusty piece of metal or it was particularly deep, a doctor will probably recommend a tetanus booster shot. The shot should be administered as soon as possible, so don't delay seeking medical attention.

, Before you do anything to treat a wound, whether it's on your own body or on someone else's, you should first wash your hands. Properly washing your hands will help reduce the risk of infection and promote faster healing at the site of the injury.Use clean, running water from a faucet. It doesn't matter whether you use warm or cold water, so choose what you're most comfortable with.
Wet your hands under the faucet, apply soap, and lather the soap until you've covered the entire surface of both hands. Make sure you lather the soap between your fingers and under your nails as well.
Spend at least 20 seconds scrubbing your hands and moving the lather around.
Rinse away all the soap and any physical dirt/debris from your hands under the faucet. Dry your hands with a clean, disposable towel, or let them air dry.
In the absence of clean, running water, you can disinfect your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. However, hand sanitizer will only kill germs and will not remove dirt or any physical debris from your hands.

, Because blood-borne pathogens are highly infectious, it's best to wear disposable gloves any time you might come in contact with someone else's blood or bodily fluids. Always use a clean pair of disposable nitrile, neoprene, vinyl, or latex gloves before touching the injured person, and wash/disinfect your hands as soon as you remove the gloves., If you're dressing a wound for someone else, have that individual get comfortable before you begin. You can have the individual sit or lie down (if feasible). You should also explain everything you're going to do before you begin to actually treat the wound.Work on the side of the injury if you're treating someone else's wound. That way you won't have to lean across the individual's body to dress the wound, which may make the individual feel stressed or uncomfortable., Before you can apply a bandage, you'll need to stop the bleeding. Bleeding is the body's way of flushing dirt and bacteria out of a wound, but it can make it difficult to keep any bandages or dressings in place if the wound is still actively bleeding.Use a clean piece of gauze or cloth to apply pressure.
Place the gauze/cloth directly on the wound and apply gentle pressure. Don't push too hard, or you could cause further injury to the site of the wound.
If the gauze gets soaked with blood, apply additional gauze over the existing piece to absorb the blood. Do not remove the gauze that you've started with, and keep applying pressure.
A deep wound may take a while to stop bleeding. Serious injuries can bleed for 30 minutes or longer.
If the injury is on an arm or leg, keep it raised above heart level. This will help slow the flow of blood to the wound, which can allow the injury to start healing.

, Once the bleeding has slowed or stopped altogether, you'll want to clean the wound. This will help remove any debris that may be lodged inside the wound, and it will also help reduce the chances of an infection.Use clean, cool water to rinse off a wound. Soap, rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, and iodine will all disinfect the wound, but they will cause a lot of pain and irritation.
Hold the wound under a faucet of clean, running water, or pour clean, cool water directly over the wound to rinse it out.
If there is any dirt or grit in the wound, sanitize a pair of tweezers by dipping them in rubbing alcohol. You may then use them to gently pick out the debris from the cut, but be careful and remember that an errant tweezer could cause a great deal of pain to an open wound.

, Before applying any antibiotic or bandages, you'll want to dry the skin around the wound. Use a clean, dry, disposable towel to gently dab the wound dry and wipe away any excess water, blood, or dirt on the skin around the injury.

Understand the purpose of an enema.,
Gather your materials.,
Wash your hands thoroughly before and after performing an enema on your child.,
Fill the bulb syringe with one to three tablespoons of warm water.,
Lubricate the end of the bulb syringe with olive oil.,
Insert the tip of the syringe into your child's rectum.,
Gently squeeze the syringe.,
Wash the syringe after use.",How to Use a Bulb Syringe2," Infant constipation is a very common problem and if other methods fail an enema may be necessary to help them. Your infant likely has constipation if she has hard stools or difficulty pooping.Talk to your pediatrician before you give your infant an enema using a bulb syringe. Sometimes enemas can cause irritation or fissures of your child’s anus, resulting in pain and stool holding.Breast feeding is less likely to cause constipation and digestive issues than formula feeding. A small amount of magnesium in a bottle can help a baby have a bowel movement.
You can also try gentle tummy rubs on your infant before trying an enema.

, To give your child an enema, you will need to have the following supplies:


A clean bulb syringe
Olive oil
A diaper
Warm water

, You will want your hands to be clean before doing this procedure. This process can be messy once your child has a bowel movement, so you will need to wash your hands again afterwards.Make sure you wash your hands for at least 20 seconds using soap.
Lather up your hands, including between your fingers, under your nails, and the backs of your hands.
Rinse your hands well and dry them with a clean paper towel.

, To fill the syringe, squeeze the air out of it first, then place the tip of the syringe in a bowl containing the water.Release your thumb slowly and the syringe will fill up. Make sure the water isn't too hot. It should feel lukewarm to slightly warm to touch. You should use no more than three tablespoons of water at a time.

, This will make it more comfortable for your infant during the enema. Take a teaspoon of olive oil and rub it on your finger.
Coat the end of the syringe with a thin layer of oil.

, Only insert it about a half inch.Avoid squeezing the syringe or you will lose the water inside too early.
This process can be unpleasant, so you may want to ask someone to help you distract your infant so he does not pay attention to his discomfort.

, The water will enter your child's bowel and help to loosen stool. Your infant should have a bowel movement within a couple of minutes of the enema..


Wait a few minutes for your child to have a bowel movement. To make this process less messy, you can put a diaper on her.
Repeat this process, if necessary.

, Clean it with hot soapy water and let it dry overnight.Be sure to rinse it thoroughly to avoid soap buildup. Squeeze the syringe several times in soapy water to clean it.
Never use an enema bulb syringe for another purpose besides enemas.

Put several drops of wax softening solution into your ear canal.,
Fill a bulb syringe with warm water.,
Place the tip of the syringe at the entrance of your ear canal.,
Tip your head to the side to let the water drain.,
Seek medical attention if the ear wax does not dislodge after several treatments.",How to Use a Bulb Syringe3," If you have a buildup of wax in your ears, it may be time to flush it out using a bulb syringe and a wax softening solution. Most cases of ear wax buildup can be treated at home.Before you attempt to remove ear wax, get your supplies together:


A clean bulb syringe
Wax softening solution. You can get this over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or use a natural remedy like baby oil, mineral oil, glycerin or hydrogen peroxide.A clean towel

, This will help to loosen the earwax before you try to remove it.


Tilt your head to one side.
Drop five to 10 drops of the solution, or your chosen home remedy, into your ear canal.
Leave the drops in for several minutes.
Keep your head tilted or put a cotton ball in your ear canal to prevent the drops from leaking. You can wait one to two days for the wax to soften up before you use the bulb syringe., Do this by squeezing the air out of it first. Then, place the tip of the syringe in a bowl of warm water.


Slowly release your grip on the syringe. This will suction the warm water up into the syringe.
Don't do this too quickly or you may end up with many air bubbles in the syringe.

, Tilt your head over a clean towel and pull your outer ear up and back. This will straighten your ear canal. Gently squeeze the water out of the syringe and into your ear canal.

, Once you have squeezed water in your ear, allow the water to drain out, as well as any dislodged wax.


When the water has drained completely, dry your outer ear with a towel.
You can repeat this process several times to flush out the wax.

, In some cases, the softening agents may only loosen the outer layer of wax and cause it to lodge deeper in your ear canal or against your eardrum. If no wax dislodges or you develop an ear ache, seek medical care for your ear.


The doctor may repeat the irrigation attempts with the bulb syringe, suction your ear canal, or use a microscope to get a better look at the inside of your ear.

Figure out what caused the food poisoning.,
Decide if immediate medical attention is necessary.,
The first and foremost thing that needs to be done in any case of food poisoning is to increase the fluid intake.,
Limit solid foods.,
Replace electrolytes.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Avoid medications.,
Wash your hands, dishes and kitchen surfaces.,
Store food properly.,
Cook meat thoroughly.,
Don't eat wild mushrooms.",How to Get Rid of Food Poisoning," Before treating the symptoms of food poisoning, it is important to figure out what caused it. Think back to the food you ate in the last 4 to 36 hours. Did you try something new? Did anything taste slightly off? Did you share food with a friend or family member who is also experiencing the same symptoms? Here are the most likely causes of food poisoning:


Food that has been contaminated by E. coli, Salmonella, and other types of bacteria. Bacteria are usually killed when food is cooked and handled properly, so this type of food poisoning usually results from undercooked meat or food that was left sitting out without refrigeration.Poisonous fish, such as puffer fish, are also a common source of food poisoning. Puffer fish should not be consumed unless it has been prepared by staff at a restaurant that is certified to do so.Poisonous wild mushrooms, looking identical to edible mushrooms, can also cause food poisoning;
, Food poisoning that was caused by bacteria, especially when it strikes an otherwise healthy person, is usually treatable at home. However, depending on the source of the food poisoning and the age of the person who has it, it may be necessary to seek medical help immediately.Call a doctor under the following circumstances:


If the food poisoning is due to poisonous fish or mushrooms.
If patient is an infant or a young child.
If the patient is pregnant.
The person with food poisoning is over 65 years of age.
The person with food poisoning is experiencing severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing, dizziness or fainting, or vomiting blood.

, It is easier for the toxins to get flushed out of your system if your water intake is good. Vomiting and diarrhea are the common symptoms in food poisoning and these lead to fluid loss, so it is important to drink water and other fluids to avoid dehydration. Adults should try to drink at least 16 cups of water a day., Food poisoning causes vomiting and diarrhea which are natural bodily functions that work to dispel the poison from the body. Eating more solid foods will cause more vomiting and diarrhea, so it's best to avoid eating big meals until one is feeling better.


It should go without saying that you should avoid eating the food that caused the poisoning. If you aren't sure what caused it, forgo eating anything that hasn't been freshly prepared right before you consume it.
If you get tired of subsisting on broth and soup, eat plain foods that won't upset your stomach, like bananas, plain boiled white rice or dry toast.
Herbal tea, especially mint tea, contains properties that calm the stomach. Try drinking a few cups of peppermint tea to stay hydrated and reduce your nausea.
Ginger ale and lemon or lime soda can also help with rehydration, and the carbonation helps settle your stomach.Avoid coffee, alcohol and fluids that cause dehydration.

, If you're losing a lot of nutrients through excess vomiting and diarrhea , you can buy an electrolyte solution from a pharmacy to replace them. Gatorade or Pedialyte will work fine, too.

, You'll probably feel weak and tired after going through the symptoms of food poisoning. Sleep as much as you need to to help your body recover faster., Over-the-counter medications meant to prevent diarrhea and vomiting can actually slow your recover by impeding the natural functions that eliminate the source of the food poisoning., Food poisoning is often caused by bacteria that get transferred to food by way of unwashed hands, dishes, cutting boards, utensils or work surfaces. Take the following measures to prevent getting food poisoning this way:


Wash your hands with warm, soapy water before preparing food.
Wash your dishes and utensils in warm, soapy water after they have been used.
Use a cleanser to wipe down your counters, tables, cutting boards and other kitchen surfaces after preparing a meal, especially one that includes raw meat.

, Make sure that raw food, such as packages of uncooked chicken or steak, is kept separate from food that doesn't need to be cooked, to prevent cross-contamination. All meat and dairy should be refrigerated as soon as you bring it home from the market., Cooking meat until it reaches an internal temperature that kills bacteria can prevent bacterial food poisoning. Make sure you know the temperature to which your meat should be cooked, and use a meat thermometer to check the temperature before you finish cooking it.Chicken and other poultry should be cooked to 165 F (73.9 C).
Ground beef should be cooked to 160 F (71.1 C).
Beef steaks and roasts should be cooked to 145 F (62.8 C).
Pork should be cooked to 160 F (71.1C).
Fish should be cooked to 145 F (62.8 C).

, Foraging for wild mushrooms has become a trend in recent years, but unless you're looking for mushrooms under the guidance of an expert, eating freshly picked mushrooms should be avoided. Even scientists have trouble distinguishing some edible and poisonous mushroom species without the aid of biological tests.

Check to see if the patient recovers.,
Stay with the victim until help arrives.",How to Give Mouth to Mouth Resuscitation," Your safety is your first priority, so before entering a potentially hazardous area, check for anything that might be dangerous. For example, look for a fallen power line, oncoming traffic, or treacherous terrain.;
, First, introduce yourself and ask if they're okay. If they don't respond, gently shake them and ask them and say ""are you okay?"". Speak loudly and clearly and pay attention to see if they hear you.


If there is no response, immediately call for an ambulance. Dial 911, 112, or whatever the emergency number is for your area. If possible, have someone else call while you continue with the patient. If you are alone, do this before beginning treatment.

, Make sure that the patient is lying on their back. Gently tilt their head back, lift their chin, and open their mouth. You may need to slide their jaw forward by applying pressure just behind their jawbones on either side of their head; this will lift the chin and open their airways so that you can see them more clearly. Look down into their throat and inspect the airway. If there is foreign matter in their mouth (water, foam, vomit, food, etc.), gently roll them onto their side and allow the substance to flow out of their mouth. If needed, use two fingers to gently sweep it out of the person's mouth. If possible, wear gloves while doing this.

, Put your ear close to the victim's mouth and nose to listen and feel for breathing. Watch or feel the patient's chest to see if it rises and falls as they breathe in and out. If you see them breathing, you won't need to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, as they are already able to breathe.

, Tilt the victim's head back to fully open their airways. Pinch their nostrils closed so that air that you push into their mouth can't escape through their nose. Place your mouth over their mouth, making sure your lips form a good seal so that the air does not escape. Blow firmly into their mouth for one second. Watch the see if their chest rises as you blow.

, If the patient's heart has stopped, perform CPR with chest compressions as well as mouth-to-mouth. Perform 30 chest compressions and then two rescue breaths, then repeat the cycle.

, If they begin breathing on their own, stop rescue breaths and roll them into the recovery position (on their side). Reassure them and keep them calm while you wait for emergency responders.

, Once you begin CPR or mouth-to-mouth, you are obliged to continue treatment until someone with the same or more training takes over, so continue treatment until the patient recovers or emergency medical responders can take over.

You can start by asking for the person's name.If the person isn't conscious, that could be a sign of a more serious injury or shock.

, If you're the only person in the area, call 911 to get help. If other people are around, assign one person to call 911., A severed finger can be distracting with all the blood, but make sure that is the most serious injury before moving on to treat it. For instance, check for more serious bleeding wounds., Help her remain calm by talking to her in a soothing voice. Try not to become panicked yourself.

Medical and emergency professionals will know what to look for and how to effectively treat shock.;
, Although any injury, illness, or disease that restricts blood flow can lead to shock, some medical problems are more likely to produce this condition than others. To evaluate whether someone might be suffering from shock, check the following list of some of the common causes of this condition and the terms for the type of shock that results:Heart problems, including heart attack or heart failure, can cause cardiogenic shock.A severe allergic reaction may lead to anaphylactic shock.If someone has low blood volume due to heavy bleeding (external or internal) or even dehydration, he might experience hypovolemic shock.When someone has a major infection, he might experience septic shock.In the event of a brain or spinal injury that damages the nervous system, neurogenic shock can occur.
Traumatic events such as accidents, disasters or assaults can lead to physiological shock

, The symptoms of shock vary depending on the type of shock and the condition that caused the body to experience shock. Refer to the list below so that you can recognize some of the common symptoms associated with shock.Low blood pressure
Rapid pulse and breathing
Sweating
Shallow breathing
Nausea or vomiting
Dilated or enlarged pupils
Weakness or fatigue
Dizziness or fainting
Skin that is cool, clammy, or pale
Bluish lips and fingernails
Anxiety, agitation, confusion, or changes in a person’s behavior or mental status

, Remember, if you suspect someone is experiencing shock, it is best to seek medical help as soon as possible. Don’t wait for symptoms to get more severe, as shock symptoms can progress rapidly.

, If the person is not showing signs of life (ie: no breathing, no carotid pulse), start CPR. An untrained person should only attempt chest compressions, not rescue breathing. Ask the 911 operator to talk you through the process if you don't already know how.


You might find this wikiHow article on how to perform CPR helpful.

, Depending on your location, it might be some time before emergency services are available to help. Taking the following steps will help stabilize the person experiencing shock if her condition appears to deteriorate and it is taking time for medical help to arrive.



Offer first aid for visible wounds and injuries.
Make the person comfortable. Provide her with a blanket and loosen restrictive clothing.Keep her from eating or drinking. Since the person may be unable to swallow, it’s best to avoid giving her anything to eat or drink to reduce the risk of choking.

Turn her onto her side if she vomits or begins bleeding from the mouth. This will help prevent choking. Proceed with caution if you think the person might have a spinal injury.
If a person with a possible spinal injury is choking, try to keep her head, neck, and back in line while rolling both the body and head together., Only attempt this if the person does not have an injury to the head, neck, leg, or spine. This position helps improve blood flow to vital organs.Lay him on his back and elevate his legs above the heart (about 8 – 12 inches).
Do not elevate his head or place a pillow under his head.
If you think this position might cause the person any pain, it’s best to leave him lying flat and wait for emergency help to arrive.

, Even if the person seems to be breathing normally, continue to monitor her condition until help arrives. You can provide this information to emergency services when they arrive.

, You can help reassure and comfort the individual who might be experiencing shock. In addition, you can also monitor the person's condition until help arrives and provide valuable information to the paramedics.

, One of the most effective ways to prevent shock is to understand who is at risk. The conditions and situations listed below increase the likelihood of shock: Severe injury
Blood loss
Allergic reactions
Anemia
Infections
Dehydration
Heart problems
Drug and alcohol use

, While you can’t anticipate all injuries, accidents, or diseases that might lead to shock, you can take some preparatory measures against this medical condition.For example, if you or someone you know has a known allergy, make sure to carry an epinephrine pen to reduce the risk of anaphylactic shock or a severe allergic reaction.
Stay hydrated to prevent the body from going into hypovolemic shock.Research ways to reduce the risks of heart disease and cardiogenic shock and what activities and situations can increase risk of shock in these individuals., Regular exercise and a healthy diet prevent some of the major diseases that increase risk of shock. You should also schedule regular physicals and talk with your doctor or a medical professional about any underlying conditions that might lead to shock.

, Taking a first-aid class will help you get the training you need to assess whether someone might be experiencing shock and offer advice on how to care for that person until medical professionals can take over.


Local hospitals and community centers often organize these classes or can direct you to resources in your area.
You can also find courses through the American Red Cross, the American Heart Association, St. John Ambulance and the National Safety Council.

Calm yourself or your patient.,
Cover the area with mineral oil.,
Release the skin from the zipper.,
Dismantle the zipper.,
Care for the injured skin.,
Apply a generous layer of petroleum jelly and a sterile pad.,
Watch for signs of infection.",How to Free a Penis from a Stuck Zipper1," Severe pain and panic is often the first response to the injury regardless of the age of the patient. Before any treatment can be done, it is important to calm the patient (even if that is you).An injured child can be very unnerving so it is important you try to stay calm when you investigate the injury.
If your child panics, be reassuring and try to give him or her a focal point, like your face or a favorite toy.;
, Mineral oil contains petroleum and can help lubricate the area and release pressure. Mineral oil and petrolatum are also known to be effective in healing wounds.Pour mineral oil over the penis and zipper. This lubricates the moving parts and often frees the skin without having to cut the zipper.
Let it soak in for about 10-15 minutes.

, Before you move to dismantling the zipper, see if you can release the skin by pulling the skin and zipper to opposite directions with your hands.


Grasp the area of skin with one hand and the zipper with the other.
Slowly and carefully pull the area of skin in the opposite direction as you pull the zipper.
Caution: if bleeding or tearing occurs, stop and seek medical attention.

, To release the skin, dismantle the zipper from below. This technique can release the pressure between the zipper plates and will free the trapped skin.Option 1: Cut the median bar (the small bridge between the anterior and posterior faceplates) at the front of the moveable zip head in half with wire cutters. This will cause the zipper to fall apart, freeing the skin relatively painlessly.
Option 2: Use a small screwdriver and insert the thin blade between the outer and inner faceplates of the zip fastener. Use a twisting motion toward the median bar to widen the gap between faceplates and help disengage the skin.
Option 3: If that doesn’t work, use pliers to apply pressure to the zipper and then, cut the teeth of the closed zipper to release the skin.

, Once the zipper has been released the skin is going to be sensitive and sore. However, it’s important to properly clean and treat the affected area and stop any bleeding.


Wash the area with water and mild soap if needed.
If there is a bleeding wound present, use a clean washcloth to apply gentle but direct pressure to the wound until the bleeding stops.
If the wound is bleeding a lot, you'll need to hold pressure for at least 15 minutes. If that does not stop the bleeding, seek medical attention., To keep the wound protected, apply petroleum jelly over the injured skin and then press a sterile gauze pad over the area. The pad will stick to the petroleum jelly.

, Open wounds can lead to infection if not taken care of. Keep a close eye on the area and look for signs of infection, including:Expanding redness around the wound
Yellow or greenish-colored pus or cloudy wound drainage
Red streaking spreading from the wound
Increased swelling, tenderness, or pain around the wound
Fever
If any of the above signs occur, seek medical consultation.

Get the patient to lie flat.,
Flex the knee.,
Feel for the artery.,
Compress against the artery.,
Feel for the pulse rate.,
Pay attention to the rhythm.,
Check the dorsalis pedis (DP) pulse.,
Look for signs of infection or disease.,
Feel the firmness of the artery.",How to Find the Popliteal Pulse," The popliteal pulse can be more difficult to detect than other pulses, so you want to make sure you have good access to the area. Start by having the patient lie down flat on their back if possible.If it is not possible for them to get on their back, have them lie down on their stomach and straighten their leg to expose the back of the knee.
Relaxation is critical to detecting the popliteal pulse. Let the patient know they should allow the leg to go limp. If they are struggling, it may help to take them through some guided breathing.;
, Once the patient is lying down, help them flex their knee to a forty-five degree angle by lifting their leg up by the sides of the knee. If the patient is lying on their stomach, you may have them leave their leg straight., Place one hand under the knee for support, and curl your fingers under the knee with the other hand. Use the fingertips to feel for the artery. The artery may feel firmer than the surrounding area, and will provide some resistance when pressed.Try not to press too hard, as this could cause discomfort for the other person.

, Use the tips of your index and middle fingers to compress against the artery. Push slowly and softly, feeling for the pulse. Do not push too hard, as this could cause you to lose the feeling of the pulse. Push just until you feel the beat in the artery.Try not to use your thumb as you look for the pulse, as your thumb has its own pulse that may obstruct the reading.

, The pulse rate is the number of beats per minute you feel while taking the pulse. You can either count for a full 60 seconds to get the pulse rate, or count for 30 seconds and double the number of beats for a solid estimate.For an adult, a resting pulse of between 60 and 100 beats per minute is considered within a normal range. If the person was active or under stress immediately before or during the reading, the pulse may be higher.
Too high or too low a pulse rate could indicate a critical problem. Seek medical help immediately if a pulse is unexpectedly outside of the normal range.

, A healthy pulse should have a steady “lub-dub” rhythm. If you are unfamiliar with what this feels like, check your own pulse on your neck or wrist as an indicator. The popliteal pulse should have the same rhythm. If the rhythm is off, seek immediate medical attention., The DP pulse can be used to check for some of the same complications as the popliteal pulse. If you cannot feel the popliteal pulse, look for a pulse in the blood vessels running down the center of the foot. Feel for a pulse as you would with any other vessel.Place your index and middle finger over the center of the patient's foot.

, Look at the patient’s legs and check for signs of complications such as ulcers, varicose veins, changes in color or pallor, and blackening or missing toes at the extremities. This could be an indicator of critical medical problems that need immediate attention., When taking the pulse, the popliteal artery may feel more firm than the area surrounding it, but it shouldn’t be hard. If the artery is hard or overly firm, let a doctor know immediately."

Put on gloves.,
Clean off the dirt.,
Keep the wound from bleeding more.,
Elevate the wound.,
Have the person lay down.,
Continue to apply pressure.",How to Give First Aid for a Severed Finger2," If they are quickly available, put on gloves before helping the person. Gloves will help protect you from any blood-borne diseases he may have. First aid kits sometimes include gloves., If you see any clear pieces of dirt or debris on the wound, you can remove it by rinsing with clean, running water (you can pour this from a water bottle if a sink is not accessible). However, if you see an imbedded object or something large, leave it where it is., Using clean cloth or gauze, press down on the wounded area. Try to staunch the flow of blood with pressure., Make sure the hand with the severed finger is above the heart, as the elevation will help slow down the bleeding., Help her lay down, using blanket or carpeting under her to keep her warm., While the wound is still bleeding, keep holding down the wound. If you become tired, ask someone else to take over. If you don't seem to be stopping the blood at all, make sure you have the wound properly covered.If you cannot continue to apply pressure, you can put on a tight bandage. However, tight bandages can cause harm over time.To apply one, wrap a piece of cloth or gauze around the wound, and use tape to keep it on.Keep the pressure on until help arrives.

Clean the finger.,
Remove jewelry.,
Wrap the finger in a damp paper towel or gauze.,
Place the finger in a plastic bag.,
Make an ice bag or bucket.,
Hand the finger to the paramedics.",How to Give First Aid for a Severed Finger3," Lightly wash off the finger to clean off dirt, especially if the wound on it looks dirty.Have someone else do these steps if you are still applying pressure.

, If possible, gently take off any rings or other jewelry. They may be more difficult to take off later., Lightly wet a clean paper towel with sterile saline solution if available (contact lens solution can be used), or tap or bottled water if saline is not available. Wring out any excess liquid. Wrap the finger in the towel., Set the wrapped finger in a zip-top bag. Zip up the bag., In a larger zip-top bag or a bucket, add ice and water. Place the zipped finger bag into the larger bag.Do not place the finger directly in water or ice, as it will get frostbitten and damage the skin. Also, don't use dry ice, as that is too cold., Once help arrives, let them take control of the finger.

Make sure the person is conscious.,
Look for bleeding.,
Look for skull fractures.,
Watch for signs of a spinal injury.,
Check for other symptoms of a serious head injury.,
Check for concussion symptoms.,
Look for signs specific to children.,
Have the person sit down.,
Be prepared to start CPR.,
Call 911.,
Treat any spinal injuries.,
Treat any bleeding wounds.,
Provide treatment around skull fractures.",How to Evaluate for Head Injuries During First Aid," While the person may still be awake, there can be other concerns. You’ll want to check him quickly to see if he is alert and responsive. One good way to check is using the AVPU responsiveness scale:Alert: Look to see if he is alert, with eyes open. Does he respond to questions?
Verbal: Ask simple questions, and see if he is able to answer them. You can also try giving instructions, like, “Sit down here,” to test his comprehension.
Pain: If he doesn’t answer, try poking or pinching. Make sure he will respond to some kind of pain, at least moving or opening his eyes. Do not shake, especially if the person appears to be dazed.Unresponsive: If he’s still not responding, give a gentle shake to see if he offers any response. If not, he is unconscious, and could have a serious head injury.;
, If you see bleeding, check to be sure it is a cut or scrape. If you see blood leaking from the nose or ears, that could be the sign of a serious brain injury., Some fractures will be easier to see, especially if the bone has broken through the skin. Take note of where those injuries are so you can tell a medical professional when they arrive.


Some fractures will be under the skin, and not immediately visible. Bruising around the eyes or behind the ear can be a sign that there is a fracture in the skull’s base. If you notice clear fluid coming from the nose or ears, that could be cerebrospinal leakage, indicating a skull fracture., Spinal injuries are very serious, and need to be treated by medical professionals. There are several signs to check for and ask about.The head is in an unusual position, or the person either can’t or won’t move her neck or back.
Numbness, tingling, or paralysis in extremities like the arms or legs. The pulse in the extremities may also be weaker than in the core.
Weakness and difficulty walking.
Loss of bladder or bowel control.
Unconsciousness, or other lack of alertness.
Complaints of a stiff neck, headache, or neck pain.
If you suspect a spinal injury, keep the person completely still and laying down until medical help gets there.

, If you see any of these symptoms, you should get medical help right away. Check if the person: Becomes very sleepy.
Begins behaving abnormally.
Develops a severe headache or stiff neck.
Has pupils that are different sizes — this may indicate a stroke.
Becomes unable to move extremities like an arm or leg.
Loses consciousness. Even a brief loss of consciousness is a sign of serious trouble.
Vomits more than once.

, Concussions are injuries to the brain, and they may not be seen as easily as cuts and bruises. There are distinctive symptoms for a concussion, so keep an eye out for them:Headache or ringing in the ears.
Confusion about current surroundings, dizziness, seeing stars, or amnesia about what just happened.
Nausea and vomiting.
Slurred speech or delayed answers to questions.
Evaluate for symptoms again after a few minutes. Some concussion symptoms don’t appear right away. This means, if you suspect someone has had a concussion, let him sit for a bit and see if the symptoms develop.If certain symptoms have worsened, that is a sign of a more serious medical problem. The person will need medical treatment as soon as possible. Check for head and neck aches that get worse, weakness or numbness in the arms and legs, repeated vomiting, increased confusion or fogginess, slurred speech, and seizures.

, There are some additional signs that will appear in children who may have head injuries. Some of these require careful observation, because kids won’t be able to verbalize their complaints as easily as adults. Because their skulls and brains are not as fully developed, head injuries can be especially serious and will need immediate attention. If you think a child may have a serious head injury, look for:Persistent crying
Refusing to eat
Repeated vomiting
In infants, look for bulging in the soft spot on the front of the head
If the child shows any signs of a head injury, do not pick her up, If someone has a head injury, the first thing he should do is sit quietly and place something cold against the injury. A cold compress or bag of ice is good, though if you are inside, a bag of frozen vegetables can do the trick.It is best if the person avoids moving unless you need to get somewhere for better treatment. If it is a fallen child, do not pick him up unless absolutely necessary., If the person should suddenly lose consciousness, or stop breathing, you will need to start giving CPR right away.Keep the person on their back, and push down on the chest. If you are trained and comfortable performing CPR, open the airways and give rescue breaths. Repeat as necessary.


While you want for the ambulance to arrive, make sure to keep checking breathing, pulse, or anything else that indicates consciousness and ability to respond., If you suspect a serious head injury, or can see signs of a fractured skull or serious bleeding, you will need emergency services to arrive. When you call, be sure to stay as calm as possible while you explain what happened and what kind of help you need. Make sure you give a specific location where the ambulance can reach you. Stay on the line until the dispatcher hangs up so they can offer advice as needed.

, Spinal injuries can cause paralysis or other serious problems. Most treatment will come from medical professionals. There are a few steps you can take to help keep the situation from getting worse until they arrive.Keep the person still. If necessary, hold his head or neck in place, or place heavy towels on both sides of the neck for stability.
Perform modified CPR if the person shows no sign of breathing, known as the jaw-thrust. Do not tilt the head back to open the airway. Instead, kneel behind the person's head and place a hand on either side of his jaw. Holding the head steady, push the mandible up — it should look as if the person has an extreme underbite. Do not do any rescue breathing, just chest compressions.
If the person starts vomiting, and you do need to roll him over to prevent choking, get a second person to help keep the head, neck, and back aligned. Make sure one of you is at the person’s head, while the other should be at their side.

, If the person has a cut on her head, you will need to stop the bleeding. Make sure to take care you avoid infecting the wound.Use water, if you have it, to flush the wound and remove most of the dirt or anything else there.
Press a dry cloth directly onto the wound to help staunch the bleeding. Secure the dressing using gauze and medical tape if you have it. If you don’t, make sure someone holds it in place.
If you are worried about a skull fracture under the cut, keep the pressure gentle. Try not to press hard so you can avoid compressing the fracture, or pushing bone fragments into the brain.
Do not wash any head wounds that are deep or bleeding a lot., While the most serious work of treating a skull fracture will be done by medical professionals, there are several steps you can take to help the injury.Without touching anything, take a look at the fractured area to see what you can learn about it. This can be useful information for the ambulance when it arrives. Just make sure that you don’t touch the wound with any foreign objects, including your finger.
Control blood loss by placing a dry cloth directly over the wound. If it soaks through, do not remove the cloth. Instead, add another one and continue to apply pressure as needed.
Be very careful not to move the person. If you must move her, do your best to keep the head and neck stable. Do not allow the head and neck to twist or turn around.
If the injured person starts vomiting, carefully turn her whole body to the side so he doesn’t choke on the vomit.

Create a contact card for every family member.,
Make sure all family members are familiar with mobile phones.,
Post emergency telephone numbers.,
Distribute copies of key documents.",How to Evaluate if You Are Prepared for Emergencies2," It is possible that you could lose your cell phone, the battery could die, you many not have Wifi access, or you may forget a significant telephone number or email address. So, it’s a great idea to make a contact card that has the telephone numbers, email addresses and addresses of family members, as well as local authorities such as police, hospitals and fire departments. Family members should carry their contact cards with them at all times., If your family includes children or seniors who don’t usually use mobile phones, you should make sure they know how to use one, including how to send and receive text messages. In the event of an emergency, it will be good to know that your grandmother, for instance, can read your text message., Put a chart with emergency phone numbers in the kitchen or living room. Program these numbers into your home phone and cell phone. Try to memorize these numbers, in case you lose your phone. It’s a good idea to include the hospital, police station and fire department numbers on this list.If you have an iPhone, use the Medical ID feature so you have easy access to these important phone numbers.
If you have another brand of smartphone, consider adding “In Case of Emergency” (ICE) contacts to your phone’s “favorites” list, or use a lock screen wallpaper image to display your important medical information., If you have parents, siblings or other close family members outside of your city, it is a good idea to give them a packet with copies of your key documents. Make copies of your passport, driver’s license, health card, wills, deeds, insurance documents, personal identification photos and other important documentation. Give the copies to your family member who lives outside the city. In the event of a disaster, you will at least have a backup copy of this important information."
"
Practice drills in your home.,
Review the evacuation route out of your home.,
Decide on family meeting places.,
Figure out where you will take your pets.",How to Evaluate if You Are Prepared for Emergencies3," For some emergency situations, you will need to stay in your home to keep safe. You should practice staying safe in your home during different kinds of disasters.Announce that you’re having an earthquake drill and instruct all family members to drop to the ground, cover themselves, and hold on tight.
Announce that you’re having a tornado drill and instruct all family members to get to the bathroom in the basement quickly, shut the door, and sit on the floor.

, You should make a floor plan of your home that indicates all of the ways to exit the building. For each room, you should try to find as many escape routes as possible, such as a window and a door that could be used to escape. You should mark the main exits out of the building, such as the front and rear doors of a house., In the event of an emergency, you and your family should have meeting places identified for different types of disasters. For example, you might want to find a meeting place on your street or in your neighborhood, a meeting place outside your neighborhood, and a meeting place outside your city.If your house burns down but the rest of the neighborhood is fine, you could meet at the neighbourhood meeting place.
In the event of a hurricane incapacitating your whole city, you could meet each other at a place outside of the city.

, Since most emergency shelters will have a hard time accepting animals, you should find a pet boarding facility in your region that could accept your pet in the event of an emergency. It is probably best to identify a few possible locations and write down relevant contact information, since these kinds of boarding facilities will be busy in the event of an emergency."
"
Check to make sure you have all of the essentials.,
Add extra items to your emergency kit.,
Consider the types of disasters in your region.,
See if your emergency kit is accessible and easy to carry.",How to Evaluate if You Are Prepared for Emergencies4," In your emergency preparedness kit, you will need water, food, medicine and basic supplies. Check to make sure you have the essentials:A three-day evacuation supply and two-week home supply of non-perishable food.
A flashlight, in good working order
Extra batteries for your flashlight and radio
A simple, hand-crank or battery-powered radio (NOAA weather radio)
A first aid kit
A seven-day supply of medications, at a minimum
A multi purpose tool
Sanitation items, such as soap and toilet paper
Personal hygiene items, such as toothpaste and deodorant
Copies of all your personal documents, such as insurance policies, birth certificates, passports, deeds, leases, medical information and proof of address
A cell phone and charger
Cash
And emergency blanket
Maps of your region and state or country
A manual can opener
An extra set of keys for your car and house

, You will thank yourself later if you add a few useful, non-essential items to your kit. Consider adding baby supplies if you have a little one, games for your kids, pet supplies, two-way radios and medical supplies for your specific medical conditions. Depending on your situation, these items may end up being essential., If you live in an area that gets a lot of blizzards and power outages, you might want to keep an electric blanket and extra sleeping bags in your emergency kit. However, if you live in an area that gets hurricanes, you might need rain gear and working gloves to remove branches and debris from your yard after the storm passes. Depending on your region, add disaster specific items to your emergency kit:Surgical masks
A whistle
Matches
Rain gear
Towels
Work gloves
Tools and supplies for protecting your home
Plastic sheeting
Duct tape
Work boots
Extra clothes
Scissors
Household bleach
Entertainment, such as books or movies
Blankets
Sleeping bags

, Make sure you have all of your supplies easily accessible in an emergency preparedness bag, such as a duffel bag or a backpack. The kit should be accessible and close to one of the exits, such as a hallway closet near a front or rear door. It should be easy to carry and all of the straps or wheels should be in good working order.Depending on the size of your kit, you may need multiple bags to hold all of the items.
You may want to distribute the kit into two or more bags, so that it is easier to carry.

Go to the emergency room.,
Ask for a sedative or a painkiller (if needed).,
Allow access the operation site.,
Ask for a local anesthesia.,
Ask to cover the area with mineral oil.,
Allow the doctor to release the skin from the zipper.,
Talk to the doctor if an elliptical skin incision or emergency circumcision is needed (only if necessary).",How to Free a Penis from a Stuck Zipper2," If you cannot release the skin from the zipper at home or if you feel unqualified to do so, seek medical attention.

, If the patient is hysterical, ask the doctor to provide adequate sedation or pain medication to calm the patient enough that the injury can be treated.If the patient is calm enough, sedation may not be needed and local anesthesia may be enough (see below).

, In order to treat the injury, the doctor may need to cut off the pants, leaving only the zipper around the skin.


This will allow a better view of the entrapment and minimizes further injury, such as the weight of the pants pulling on the skin.

, A local anesthetic (such as lidocaine) or a topical anesthetic (such as EMLA cream) may be applied to numb the skin locally and facilitate its release from the zipper.Dorsal penile block can also be used but is typically saved for difficult entrapments only or those involving a large area of skin.
Note: the benefits of a local anesthetic should be weighed against the injection itself and any additional pain resulting from that.

, This helps reduce friction and can ease the release of the skin. Let the oil soak for about 15 minutes.

, The skin may be removed in a few different ways depending on where the skin is entrapped.When skin is caught between the teeth, the doctor may cut the zipper above or below the site where the entrapment is and gently pull the teeth apart to release the skin.
If the entrapment is within the sliding part of the zipper, the skin is released by cutting the median bar (the small bridge between the anterior and posterior faceplates) to allow the faceplates to fall apart and the entrapped skin to be released.

, If the skin cannot be freed otherwise, the use of an elliptical skin incision or an emergency circumcision will be performed by an urologist under general anesthesia."

Decide on the right size for the kit.,
Choose the appropriate container material.,
Make sure the container can be locked.,
Label the box as a children’s first-aid kit.,
Affix emergency numbers to the kit.,
Create a checklist of item to include in the kit.,
Include a variety of bandages.,
Add basic medical tools.,
Consider including additional first aid items.,
Include medications depending on your child’s age.,
Show your child where the kit is located.,
Go over each item in the kit with your child.,
Include a pictogram for each item in the kit.,
Practice with your child.,
Update the kit after each use.",How to Make a First Aid Kit for Kids," When deciding on a container for your child’s first aid kit, you want to consider how and when the kit will most likely be used and where it will be stored. If you are making a first aid kit for your child to bring to school, make sure it will fit in their locker or cubby. If you are making a kit to keep at home, be sure it won’t be too big or cumbersome for your child to pull the kit from wherever it is stored. A manageable size for a container that would still be able to contain the necessary items for your kid is a case the size of a shoebox., First aid kits can come in a variety of sizes and are built from a variety of materials. Choosing the right material for your first aid kit should again be based on how the kit will be used by your child. If you want them to keep the kit with them at all times, you might want to consider a durable plastic container so it is malleable enough to fit inside a crowded backpack or sleepover bag. If you intend for the kit to stay at home, go for a more sturdy material like metal, tin, or hard plastic. Some additional considerations:Make sure the container is waterproof so that none of the items inside get damaged.
Consider using a container that has a handle to make it easier for the child to transport it from one place to another.
Make sure the container is not made of anything that will be too heavy for the child to lift once it is full of first aid items.
Translucent containers will make it easier to keep track of items that need to be replaced.

, When not in use, you want to make sure that the contents of the first aid kit are unable to be tampered with by any younger children in the house. This is why it is essential for the box to have a clasp on it. A clasp or lock will also ensure that the kit does not open easily during transportation. You want to be sure that the clasp is one that the child can open quickly in case of an emergency. Try to find a container that has the same type of clasp found on children’s lunch boxes. Since the kit will probably not be used very often, it is also a good idea to practice opening this lock with your child so that they remember how to open it in an emergency., The kit should be labeled clearly as a first aid kit for kids. Using a bright color to paint the box, especially red, will make the kit stand out within a crowded locker or cabinet. You should also paint or affix a symbol to show that it should be used for first aid, which is typically designated by a medical emblem or a cross (usually in white against a red background or vice versa).It is important for the label the children’s kit so it is distinct from that of the adults’ first aid kit. For example, also label the kit with the child’s name (e.g., KATIE’S FIRST AID KIT).
Consider keeping the adult first aid kit high up where it can’t be accessed by the children in the house, and be sure it has a more advanced lock or clasp on it so it is childproof.

, In addition to stocking the kit with first aid items, it is also a great idea to include any emergency numbers your child might need in an emergency. Collect the telephone numbers for the local emergency room, 9-1-1, Poison Control, your contact information, and the number for a trusted neighbor, family member, or friend. Each number should be clearly printed underneath the name of the location or person.


Consider including a small icon or picture for each location or person. This will help your child easily locate the number they need in a stressful emergency situation.
Review the icons and the list of numbers with the children who will use the kit so that they are aware of which contact is which, and how to dial the numbers, and who to call in certain situations.

, A list should be made that includes all of the items you wish to include in the first aid box. This list will not only help you stock the new kit initially, it will also help you keep track of what items have been used and need to be replaced, expiration dates, and whether or not any items or medications are missing. You should also review this list with your child as you stock the first aid kit, explaining to them what each item is, what is for, and how to use it.

, Keep all of your bandages together in a section of the kit. If your kit does not already have dividers built in, put all of the bandages in a clear plastic bag labeled “BANDAGES” with permanent marker. You can also purchase smaller plastic containers to stack within the first aid kit, also labeling the container for bandages with permanent marker. The Red Cross recommends including the following types of bandages and dressings in first aid kits:2 absorbent compress dressings (5 x 9 inches)
25 adhesive bandages of various sizes
5 sterile gauze pads (3 x 3”)
5 sterile gauze pads (4 x 4”)
Gauze roll
Roll of cloth adhesive tape
One 3” wide and one 4” wide roller bandages (“ACE bandage”) for wrapping wrist, elbow, ankle, and knee injuries
2 triangular bandages
Sterile cotton balls and cotton-tipped swabs

, Since this kit is for a child, you don’t want to include any tools that would further endanger them. Because of this, you may need to revise the suggested tools depending on the age or ability of your child. These tools will help them remove debris and prepare the wound to be dressed and bandaged. Again, keep these tools in the same area within your kit, keeping them within a separate, labeled clear plastic bag or container for ease of use. Some suggested medical tools to include:Small, sharp scissors with rounded, child-safe tips
Tweezers
2 pairs of non-latex gloves
Non-mercury oral thermometer
CPR breathing barrier mask (with one-way valve)
Instant cold compress
Instant hot pack
Hand sanitizer
5 antiseptic wipe packets or antiseptic spray (for external cleaning only)
Zip-close plastic bags (to dispose of medical waste)

, Depending on the size of your container and where the kit will be used, there are additional items that are recommended to include in a first aid kit. These are more applicable for use with older children, since many of these items might not be safe for young children to handle. Some additional kit items to include:


Sterile drinking water
Eye protection
Sterile eyewash
Prepackaged space (warming) blanket
Aluminum finger splint
Safety pins (to easily fasten splints and bandages)
Turkey baster or other suction device (for flushing out wounds)
Antibiotic ointment (ones containing ingredients such as bacitracin or mupirocin)
Calamine lotion (for stings or poison ivy)
Hydrocortisone cream, ointment, or lotion (for itching)
Flashlight and extra batteries

, Depending on the age of the kid(s) using the kit, you may or may not include medicine within the first aid kit. If you do choose to include medications, be sure to keep these separate from the bandages and tools, and make sure the smaller container or bag for medicine is clearly labeled as such. You should also include a measuring cup for any liquid medication, and consider labeling each medicine with the required dosages. Recommended medications to include:


Pain and fever medicines, such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen
Antihistamine medicine to treat allergies and swelling
Decongestants to treat nasal congestion
Anti-nausea medicine to treat motion sickness and other types of nausea
Anti-diarrhea medicine
Antacids to treat upset stomach
Laxatives to treat constipation
Small doses of any prescription medications taken by the child/children
Epinephrine autoinjector (if necessary)

, You want to make sure that your child knows where the kit is located in case of an emergency. You want to make you kit easily accessible so that they don’t have to rummage around trying to find it. Designate a spot that is clearly defined, visible, and consistent so that locating the kit becomes routine. You also want to be sure to establish a location for the kit that is safely out of reach for any younger children in the house., As you stock the kit with first aid items, go over each item with your child one at a time. Explain to them what the item is and how it should be used. Do this calmly and try to avoid scaring your child. Remember that empowering them with this knowledge will help make emergency situations less scary. To avoid overwhelming younger children, only review 1 - 3 items per day., Even with careful review and instruction, the anxiety of the situation may cause your child to forget how to use each item in an emergency. To help them remember how to use each item, create a booklet with pictures depicting each item. A pictogram can be printed out from images found online to show how each item in the kit should be used, in picture form. Go through each pictogram with your child in detail before putting it in the first aid kit. Consider creating separate pictogram booklets for each section of items within the kit (e.g., bandages, tools, medications, etc.).

, In order to make sure your child understands the kit and its items, role-play a few scenarios to get your child to demonstrate their understanding. Ask your child to do a demonstration of how each item in the kit should be used. Be sure to do this in a relaxed setting that does not have any interruptions. Make it fun by pretending your child is the doctor and you are their patient!

, Using the checklist within the kit, regularly monitor the contents of the kit. Be sure to review the kit’s contents after each use to take stock of what is depleted and needs to be replaced. Also be sure to check the medications and ointments to make sure they are still within their use-by date. If they have expired, remove the item, properly discard it, and restock the kit with a fresh item. Any items that are reusable should be inspected thoroughly to ensure that they are in good working condition and that they were not damaged during use."

Lift your ankle off the ground.,
Keep your foot at a 90-degree angle.,
Place adhesive pads on the front and back of your ankle to prevent blisters.,
Wrap your foot and ankle with pre-wrap.,
Adhere a small piece of tape to the ends of the pre-wrap to keep it in place.",How to Tape an Ankle1," It will be much easier to complete the tape job with your foot off the ground. Rest it on a short stool or a chair, or sit on a table and hang your foot off the edge.


It is usually easier to have someone else tape your leg, as they can focus on taping and you can focus on keeping your ankle still.;
, Taping your foot protects it from moving too quickly and furthering any injuries. You want to tape it at a 90-degree angle so that you can move your foot up and down slightly, but still protect you ankle and ligaments from extreme movements

, These pads, often sold in outdoor stores to prevent blisters while hiking, will keep the tape from rubbing against your skin and causing painful blisters. Place a 2-4 inch pad on the front and back of you ankle – roughly at the places where your foot meets the edge of a pair of sneakers.


Two 2x2 inch squares of gauze work well if you do not have pads.
You can buy large adhesive pads, like Moleskins, and use kitchen scissors to cut them into the right shape.

, Pre-wrap is stretchy, soft gauze that protects your skin and hair from tape. Starting near the ball of your foot (the pads of skin right before your toes), wrap around your foot in pre-wrap, working towards your ankle so that every layer slightly overlaps the last one. Stop wrapping just under your calf muscle, 4-5 inches above your ankle bone. Think about ""mummifying"" your foot.


Aim to cover up most of your skin to protect it from the tape so that it cannot pull out hair when you need to remove it.
Your heel will often be uncovered, but that’s okay – there is no hair to pull off and your skin is tough.

, If you wrapped it tightly enough you can also tuck the ends of the strip into the wrap around your ankle. Use 3-4 pieces of 1-1/4 inch athletic tape to keep the pre-wrap in place.


Athletic tape looks like masking tape, with small holes in the surface to help your skin breathe. It is available at most sporting good stores.

",How to Pack an Outdoor Camping First Aid Kit," These may include venomous animals and internal injuries. Not knowing about these hazards can even lead to death, so don't forget to call your campsite and inquire about them! For example, if there were venomous animals, you would need an anti-venom, firearm that launches flares, etc. to take with you.;
, Your container should be labeled as a first aid kit so it can be easily recognizable. It should also be roomy, light, waterproof, watertight, and small enough to easily fit in your backpack.

, This includes Band-Aids in various sizes, neosporin, gauze, medical tape, gloves, a triangle bandage, and small scissors.

, This includes moleskins for blisters, an ice pack (the kind that starts up with a shake is best), anti-itch cream for bug bites, and sunburn ointment.

, Advil and any inhalers, allergy medicine or other medicine you and your companions may need. You can also pack any over-the-counter medications, just in case anyone gets hurt or sick.

Continue taping in a figure eight motion, alternating around your foot and ankle 3 times.,
Wrap up your lower leg.,
Create a “heel cap” by covering your heel with 1-2 pieces of tape.,
Flex your ankle to every side to make sure you can move it.,
Keep practicing your tape job so your ankle feels comfortable and stable.,
Remove the tape carefully with scissors when done.",How to Tape an Ankle2," If you feel tingling or pins in your toes, remove the tape and try again. The tape should feel firm and secure when you are done so that you can move your ankle from side to side and up and down.


Use 1-1/4 inch athletic tape for the best results.

, Take a long piece of athletic tape and attach it just above your interior ankle bone, the knob of bone on the inside of your foot. Wrap the piece of tape under your heel and then connect it to your opposite ankle bone, ending it just above the ankle bone. The tape should form a “U” shape around your foot.You should feel the tape pull down on your inside ankle bone, and then up on the outside ankle bone.

, Make a few more of these U-shaped tape stirrups to keep your ankle secure, overlapping each piece of tape by roughly a half inch.

, For the following steps, do not cut out a lot of long pieces of tape and attach them to each other. Take one piece of tape and leave it on the roll. Wrap 6-12 inches of tape, then pull more off the role, cutting the tape off only when you are done.

, Adhere your tape under the arch of your foot, and then bring it up and over the top of your foot. Continue this wrap around your arch 2-3 times, overlapping each layer of tape, for added stability, as you move towards your heel.

, This is the key motion for stability. Coming from the bottom of your foot, wrap up and over the top of your foot. The tape will cross over the curve where your foot meets your lower leg and then continue around the back of your lower leg.


This will look a little like the beginning of a figure eight.

, Your tape should now be around the back of your lower leg. Cross it down around the front of your foot, coming diagonally back down around towards your arch. Bring it under your arch and back to your ankle joint, the back around your lower leg. Repeat 2-3 times, overlapping half of the tape each time., After coming around the back of your lower leg the third time, continue taping up past your ankle, overlapping the tape up to the edge of your pre-wrap. The entire stirrup should be covered with tape, roughly 3-4 inches above your ankle bone.

, Cut off a few small pieces of tape to cover your heel with a “C” shaped brace, coming around the back of your foot and bottom of your heel. Cover any last bits of exposed skin., You want a limited range-of-motion in your ankle. You should be able to move up and down and to both sides, but you shouldn’t be able to move as far as you would without the tape. Jog lightly on it to make sure you can run comfortably without pain., While the basics of taping an ankle are easy, perfecting your work takes some practice. Focus on applying the tape with even pressure, using as few pieces of tape as possible to wrap your foot. It can help to ask a friend to be a “dummy,” allowing you to tape their ankle as practice.


Apply gauze or protective pads on the front and back of your ankle to prevent blisters.
Wrap your foot and ankle with pre-wrap to protect your skin.
Wrap 2-3 long pieces of tape from the inside of your ankle to the outside as U-shaped stirrup straps.
Cover your ankle bone with tape from front to bottom, back to top.
Overlap the tape by half an inch as you cover your foot and lower leg., The easiest way to remove the tape is with a tape removal blade, but ordinary scissors will work if you do not have one. Insert one of the blades between your skin and the pre-wrap and then carefully cut around your ankle bone to remove the tape. It should come off in one piece."
"
Know that an ankle sprains happen when you damage ligaments.,
Tape your ankle before practices and games to prevent injury.,
Consider buying an ankle brace if you have chronic pain.,
See a sports medicine professional to diagnose chronic or extreme pain.",How to Tape an Ankle3," A ligament holds together joints by attaching two pieces of bone together.They allow your joints to hinge, but when they hinge too far they can tear, causing ankle sprains. Taping your ankle prevents these ligaments from moving too far, which keeps them from suffering further damage.

, Taping your ankle can be done to mitigate an injury as well as prevent damage. For example, if you are playing a soccer game on a wet, slippery surface, you might tape your ankle ahead of time to protect your foot from slipping or rolling. You do not have to have a pre-existing injury to benefit from taping your ankle., Ankle braces function the same way as a good tape job, but you do not have to apply the tape before every practice or game. They may even be more cost effective then taping if you need to tape your ankle every day throughout an entire sports season.

, Taping your ankle is only effective for minor injuries or preventing future injuries. It is not a cure-all for ankle pain or major ligament damage. If you have constant or shooting pain, it is time to take a break from athletic activity and see an athletic trainer or orthopedic specialist."

Purchase a bag or container that will hold your first aid items.,
Remember the basics when packing your kit, such as:


an assortment of adhesive bandages
gauze pads
safety pins
adhesive tape
antibiotic
antiseptic and hydrocortisone creams
insect sting relief pads
cotton balls
cotton swabs
Vaseline
pain relievers
digital thermometer
tweezers
scissors
a needle

saline solution.

,
Include children's versions of the above, if applicable.,
Don't forget the items for more concerning injuries.,
Consider adding an easy to comprehend first aid manual to the items in your car's first response kit.

,
Add personal items that your family is bound to need.,
Pack an emergency blanket and water close to your first aid kit, if you have the room.

,
Make room for a lite stick, flashlight, and call police flag, just in case you get stranded on the side of the road.,
Arrange all your items in an organized fashion.,
Finished.

",How to Pack a First Aid Kit for Your Car," Select something that has clear compartments so you can see what you need and easily access smaller items. You may even want to mark some of the pockets to remind you where items are stored. Additionally, choosing a waterproof bag or container would be ideal.;
,, Such as baby and children's pain relievers, prescribed medications, Benadryl spray, a syringe or medicine cup for administering medications, and baby wipes.

, These items should include hot and cold packs, disposable synthetic gloves, a disposable mask, a suction bulb, anti-diarrheal medication, eye wash, and plastic bags for disposing unhygienic items.

,, Examples include baby products, allergy and asthma medications, motion sickness medication, and an Epi-Pen.

,, A prepaid emergency cell phone can also be included.

, Put small items in accessible pockets around the edges of the bag or box. Pack the larger items in the center of the container, but stand them up side by side so you can see them immediately. Slide the manual in an outside compartment.

"
Pack all prescription medications.,
Include over-the-counter medications in pill or powder form.,
Include a small tube of sunscreen and bug repellant.,
Pack a source of electrolytes.,
Make a space for topical medications.,
Include a small vial of iodine.,
Pack a type of protective lubricant.,
Choose a type of adhesive or tape.,
Include a form of liquid bandage.,
Pack gauze pads, bandages, and Band-Aids.,
Add alcohol prep swabs or wipes to your kit.,
Include scissors and tweezers.,
Consider adding an irrigation syringe.,
Include a pair of medical gloves.,

Bring medical items for your dog.,
Include a weather blanket.,
Heed location-specific medical warnings.,
Add a primary care instruction booklet.,
Choose a container for your kit.,
Purchase travel sized or sample-sized medications.,
Place similar items together when packing.,
Personalize your pre-packaged kit.,
Add locks, if needed.",How to Pack a First Aid Kit for a Hike," Any medications that you require on a regular basis should go with you on your hike. These items will not be available in the wilderness, or usually even in a general store, so it is better to be safe than sorry. This even applies if you anticipate being back from your hike in time.


Prescription pill packaging can often be bulky. To save space and weight, take out the dosage that you will need (and maybe one extra) and place it in a pill bag. Label the outside of the bag with the medication name, dosage, and expiration date. If you have multiple medications, make sure to put them into separate bags to avoid confusion.;
, You may suffer from a variety of health complaints or injuries when hiking, so you want to pack medications that cover a wide spectrum of potential ills. Buy travel sized versions of medications or place the pills in separate, labeled pill bags.


Pack a pain relief and anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Use whatever brand has worked well for you in the past, like Advil or Motrin. These will help to dull the pain and minimize inflammation in the case of injury.
Pack an anti-diarrheal medication, such as Loperamide (sold under the brand name of Immodium, etc.). Choose the pill version of all medications when possible. Diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which can be life-threatening.Pack a couple antacid tablets, such as Pepcid. These will help with any indigestion that you may experience. This is especially important if you will be eating food mid-hike.
Pack an antihistamine, such as Benadryl. This can minimize the effects of allergies and other breathing conditions. It can also lessen the severity of a skin rash.

, Choose a high SPF sunscreen (50+) that is also water and sweat resistant. You will want to include this even if you are hiking in a shady locale. A sunburn can present a serious health hazard.Bug repellant lotion or wipes will keep you from getting bitten, reducing the risk of bug-borne diseases.

, These come in a variety of forms: tablets, gels, powders. Choose one that you prefer and include it in your pack. You will most likely sweat when you hike and electrolytes can help to replace that moisture in your system. It is also a good hydration option if you get sick and cannot tolerate standard food., Include packets of antibiotic cream, such as Neosporin, in your kit. You can use this ointment for sanitary wound care. It also doubles as a petroleum-based lubricant if you need to apply it to areas being chafed by backpack straps.Zinc oxide cream is another option to treat spots being rubbed raw.If you start to feel a burning in your feet, lightly applying antibiotic cream can help to fight off a possible fungal infection. This can be a particular problem when hiking in humid locations.
Packing a small tube or packet of hydrocortisone cream is also a good idea. It will help to treat skin irritations.

, A 1 oz. bottle is sufficient for a single hike. Read the instructions carefully to see if you need to dilute the iodine with water in order to treat wounds. Iodine’s antiseptic qualities help prevent infection.Iodine can also be used to purify water. The rule is generally ten drops per quart of cloudy water. Let it sit for 30 minutes and it should be safe to drink.Be aware that not all people react well to iodine. Days before you leave, you might want to test it on a small patch of skin. Iodine is also not generally recommended for use by pregnant women or those with compromised immune systems.

, Chapstick or a lip lotion is great for any type of hike. If your lips crack open, they can be prone to infection. Vaseline is also helpful. You can use it to moisten wounds. You can also apply it to your skin to prevent chafing.

, You need a tape that can serve many purposes. It needs to be durable and it should maintain its stickiness in varying conditions. You can always go with standard medical tape, but it is not very versatile. Duct tape is a good choice. Fold it over on itself until you’ve created a small tape packet that can be unfolded for use.If you don’t want to mess with scissors, paper tape is good as you can tear it by hand. However, it doesn’t always stand up well to wet conditions., Some wounds are so superficial that a bandage is simply a hassle. Other wounds are so deep that you need extra adhesive help prior to receiving stitches. Many different types of liquid bandages are sold over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or grocery store.

, Tightly roll the gauze and it will take up minimal space. Triangular, roll, and ace bandages should all be included. Include an assortment of sizes so that you can respond properly to all medical situations. Two-inch and four-inch pads are the best and can always be cut down if needed.It is best to pack a mix of adhesive and non-adherent bandage options.Butterfly closure strips, the 4-inch variety, are good to pack for small wounds and cuts.Moleskin is a very popular choice amongst hikers. It is particularly useful in shielding blistered skin. Moleskin comes in synthetic skin sheets that can be cut as needed. They adhere to your skin, providing a barrier.Pack 2-3 whole sheets in your kit., These wipes often come in individual sealed packages made for quick and easy use. Rub one of these wipes on your hands before treating yourself or someone else. Use them to clean a wound area as well., Trauma scissors are a good option due to their blunt end. You can cut near a person’s body without injuring the skin. Foldable scissors are preferred by some people as they take up less space. When choosing your tweezers, look for metal ones with a good sturdy tip., This is an unusual item to pack but it can be very helpful when cleaning out a wound. It’s small and can make a significant difference in infection prevention., Barrier gloves are an essential if you need to render assistance or if you require care. Surgical rubber or non-latex gloves are the best option. Try on the gloves to make sure that they fit well before you include them in your kit., Bring medical items to assist you in the event that your medical condition worsens. For example, if you are diabetic, it is a good idea to pack extra insulin.Or, if you’ve suffered from ankle injuries in the past you may want to pack extra gauze in case of a sprain., An EpiPen is useful to bring even if you do not have any known allergies. You may be able to save someone else. You also may discover that you are allergic to a bite or plant., If you are hiking with a dog, you may want to pack a few animal-specific treatment items. Check with your vet for specific instructions as to dosage, etc. For example, dogs can use certain types of aspirin.It is also a good idea to pack activated charcoal. It will be helpful in the event that your dog ingests toxic plants or materials.Due to their anatomy, dogs are particularly prone to eye injuries. Pack a small bottle of saline to flush out your dog’s eyes if needed., If an emergency occurs, you may be stuck outdoors far longer than intended. An emergency blanket, often made of a mylar material, can help you maintain a healthy body temperature and avoid hypothermia. This is especially important if you are hiking in an area that experiences cold temperatures., If you are hiking in a foreign country or a location that you are unfamiliar with, browse online to see if there are any medical or wildlife warnings available. The World Health Organization (WHO) website posts many of these warnings. In some situations an antibiotic, such as Ciprofloxacin, is a good addition to your first aid kit., Some people feel better knowing that they have a booklet to reference in case of an emergency. However, the best option is to familiarize yourself with field medicine beforehand via an in-person or online class offered by many nature agencies and outdoors stores., Use a container that is large enough for your items, yet small enough to not present a weight burden. It needs to be self-contained and waterproof. A travel micro-organizer works well and contains zip pockets to make organizing easier. Or, you can use a generic plastic container with a sealable lid.


A money deposit bag is another option. It has a zip opening and is sturdy. You can purchase one at your local office supply store. Other people prefer using a coffee can that can double as a water boiler.A one or two-gallon plastic freezer bag is another option. You can use quart baggies or pill baggies for smaller items, such as medications. However, be careful as this system can get disorganized quickly and the bags can puncture., Go to the travel aisle in your local drugstore or grocery store. Look for small container versions of the medications that you need. If a package is larger, but smaller pieces can be taken out, like with Band-Aid boxes, that is okay too. Weight is always a consideration when hiking so, when in doubt, go with the miniature version of items.


If a small version of a particular medication is not available, don’t worry. You can get the standard size and then remove the pills that you want and place them in a pill baggy in your kit.

, Group items according to usage. Medications should all go together. Topical creams should be near to one another. Bandages should be stacked and stored together. This will make it easier to pull out exactly what you need in the event of an emergency.

, There are many great pre-packaged kits available online and in stores. After you receive your kit, take an inventory of what is inside. Discard any items that you feel are not useful for you. Add other items to fit your unique hiking needs and medical situation.For example, if you react badly to Advil, you may want to toss it out and consider another anti-inflammatory medication.

, If you will be hiking with children you want to take care that they do not have access to your kit and the medications contained therein. You may want to purchase a kit bag that will allow you to lock it through the zipper area, or another access hole.

There are two ways which you can obtain a dedicated first aid kit for fishing.,
The other way to create a fishing first aid kit is to get a basic first aid kit and add items specialized towards a fishing trip.

,
A basic first aid kit goes for a range of prices with the top-end ones costing up to $200.,
After obtaining your basic first aid kit, you can add other important components.,
Here are the things which you should obtain:


Tube of antiseptic cream x 1 (For minor cuts in order to prevent infection)
Sunburn lotion (relief cream) x 1
Small bottle of Betadine x 1 (A basic antiseptic for wounds to kill germs and stop infection)
Tweezers x 1 (To remove splinters or foreign matter in a wound)
Instant ice pack (For bruising and surface injuries)
Pack of tissues x 1 (For cleaning generally)
Insect bite cream x 1 (For mosquito bites, or worse)
Pain medication such as Panadol or Nurofen x 1
Cotton balls and tips x 20
If the first aid kit is stored in a soft pack, purchase a sturdy tool-box with compartments in order to organize the items and protect sterile equipment in the messy environment of fishing.

",How to Make a First Aid Kit for Fishing," You can simply buy one pre-made at any decent fishing tackle shop. Prices range from $100-150. There are also some great sites on the internet which sell these kits.;
,, A basic first aid kit should contain:


Adhesive plastic strips x 30
Adhesive dressing tape: 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) x 5 centimeter (2.0 in) x 1
Triangular bandage x 1
Non-adhesive dressings x3
Disposable latex gloves x 1
Sterile tubes of saline solution (minimum 10ml) x 3
Medium combine dressing pads (9 x 20cm) x 1
Gauze bandage 5 centimeter (2.0 in) width x 1
Blunt scissors (for cutting gauze and bandages) x 1

, Most of these you will find at home and the others at a chemist.

Instruct students to keep their 911 programmed cell phones on their desktops.,
Ask students to take a few minutes to familiarize themselves with the layout of the classroom.,
Ask your students if anyone has diabetes or a peanut allergy, then allow students time to respond.,
Prominently display a CPR poster in the classroom and point it out to the students.,
Encourage students to take a basic first aid course.,
Create and maintain the impression that each student is a potential life saver.,
Encourage students to create ""reaction to crisis strategies"".,
Troubleshoot ""reaction to crisis strategies"" with students.,
Show appreciation.",How to Enlist Student Participation in Creating Safer Classrooms," On the first day of class, instruct all students to take out their cell phones and walk them through the process of programming 911 into its one-touch memory.


Instruct them to place the cell phone on their desktop so it is available for use during any potential emergency, first thing, each time they come to class for the remainder of the school year.;
, When they've had adequate time to look around, ask them if anyone sees a potential hazard.


If a serious hazard is brought to your attention, report it immediately and thank the students for bringing the problem to your attention.
Instruct the students to continue to look around the classroom every time they're in it, and notify you immediately if they spot a hazard.
If the issues they point out are minor hazards, discuss this with them, then show them that you are filling out a request for repair form to submit to the school administrators.

, Make a note of any conditions they report having, then remind them to watch out for one another while in your classroom and tell you immediately if they see another student under duress, or apparently suffering an allergic reaction.


Make sure students know where the nearest water fountain is located, but encourage them to bring a bottle of water with them to class. Remind them that the water in the bottles can be used in a variety of ways to ensure greater safety in the classroom.
Encourage diabetics to bring any food item they might need into the classroom and keep it at their desks for easy access.

, Read through the poster instructions aloud to reinforce the information.

, The more students who are trained in CPR and basic first aid, the greater the chances of lives being saved during and after a weather or human-related catastrophe. Having such knowledge fosters self-confidence in students and enables them to offer competent aid both at school, and in their homes, in cases of emergency.

, Clearly explain to the students that each of them is capable of saving the life of another classmate, sibling, stranger, or teacher.


Tell them that by calling 911 on their cell phone during an emergency, they are potentially saving a life and that individual participation is vital to everyone's safety.
Remind students throughout the school year that they are ""walking life-savers"" and encourage them to find ways to improve their life saving skills and the safety of others as they go about their work at school.
Remind them that something as insignificant as picking up discarded trash around the school/school property creates a safer environment for others.

, Periodically, throughout the school year, offer the students an imaginary crisis (such as a fire in the room) and ask them to devise a response strategy that is uniquely suited to their best talents or abilities, and the situation. Have them share their strategies with the class.


Encourage them to entertain themselves by creating such response strategies, any time they are bored. By training them to devise these types of plans, you are empowering them, inspiring them to form independent reasoning skills, and strengthening their sense of self-reliance.

, In a light-hearted manner, encourage students to offer suggestions on how unique ""reaction to crisis strategies"" can be combined, changed, or rejected, to improve the outcome of the imaginary crisis. This will give you and the students the opportunity to discover strengths and weaknesses shared, and help students determine who they trust within the classroom to provide the greatest safety should an actual emergency occur.


This process will also encourage students to voice concerns with each other, freely, and fine tune their planned responses to threats they might encounter outside of your classroom.

, Recognize the tremendous impact students have on your personal safety, and show appreciation for their time and attention to creating a safer school environment. Ask the administrative staff to voice appreciation for the student's efforts and publicly commend individuals who take first aid/CPR training, fire safety courses, and emergency response training.

Identify your needs


Think about what you need your first aid kit for.,
Conduct a risk assessment to identify some of the following factors:


How many people is this kit for?,
Having identified your needs, create a basic kit.,
Personalise your kit to meet the exact needs of your workplace


If you are dealing with a location likely to deal with burns then you will need some form of burns kit e.g.,You should now be able to go out and purchase your equipment sound in the knowledge you have accurately identified your needs

",How to Stock a First Aid Kit,"

Is it for general work?
Is it for a hot work area (kitchen, barbecue pit)?
Is it for travel?

;
,
Do you require burns equipment?
Do you require Exposure equipment?
What sort of injuries are more likely than others to occur?
Do you require food safe materials?
Do you require anti allergen equipment (Latex free gloves etc.)?
Are you likely to have eye injuries?
Are you likely to have to clean up biological accidents (large blood loss, vomit, urine and excrement)?

,


Wallace Cameron advise a basic kit for 1-10 people to contain

Guidance Leaflet
20 Sterile Plasters
2 Eye pads
4 Triangular Bandages
6 Safety Pins
6 Medium Dressings
2 Large Dressings
2 Sets of gloves



,

Alcohol Free Wipes 4

Cotton WOW Bandage 1
Finger Bandage 1
Gloves (pair) 2
Guidance leaflet 1
Non Adherent dressings 3
Saline mini pod 6


If you require exposure equipment then add a few foil blankets
Expand the basic kit by adding to it as required e.g.

Crush injuries more likely add additional large bandages
Finger injuries more likely add finger bobs and stalls
Small cuts and grazes add more cleaning wipes and plasters.


If you require food safe equipment please ensure you purchase the correct types

In Britain for example foodsafe plasters are blue and have metal in them to make them easier to spot/detect via x-ray and prevent entering the food chain


With anti-allergen equipment again please ensure that you purchase the correct type
If eye injuries are likely invest in an eyewash kit.

It is recommended that different sizes of eyewash solution be provided,


To clean up biological equipment invest in body fluid kits e.g.

Absorbent powder 1
Apron 1
Bonded wipes 2
Disinfectant Spray 1
Disinfectant wipes 1
Disposable bag 1
Gloves (pair) 1
Oversleeves 1
Scraper 1
Consider the distance that will be between each kit you don't want one central kit that can take 10 minutes to retrieve, several smaller kits are better and will allow faster response

Obtain new crutches or used ones that are in very good condition.,
Adjust the crutches to a comfortable height.,
Hold the crutches correctly.,
Use the crutches to help you walk.,
Use the crutches to help you sit.,
Lead with your good foot when you go up stairs.,
Go down stairs with your injured foot in front of you.",How to Use Crutches," Make sure the crutches are sturdy, and that the rubber padding, where your armpit rests, is still springy. Inspect the the bolts or pins that adjust the crutch length. Make sure the crutches have the rubber tips at the bottom.;
, Stand up straight and place your palms on the hand grips. When adjusted to the correct position, the top of the crutches should reach between 1 1/2 and 2 inches below your armpits. The hand grips should be even with the top of your hip line.When the crutches are properly adjusted, your arms should be comfortably bent while you stand up straight.
When you adjust the crutches, wear the shoes you'll be most frequently wearing when you use the crutches. They should have low heels and good support.

, The crutches should be held tightly to your side for maximum control. The cushions at the tops of the crutches should not actually touch your armpits; rather, your hands should absorb the weight of your body as you start to use the crutches., Lean forward and place both crutches about a foot in front of your body. Move as though you are taking a step with your injured foot, but place your weight instead on the hand grips of the crutches. Swing your body forward and rest your non-injured foot on the ground. Repeat to continue moving forward.Hold your injured foot cocked slightly behind your body, several inches from the floor so that it does not drag.
Practice walking this way with your head forward, rather than looking at your feet. The motion will begin to feel more natural with practice.
Practice walking backward, too. Look behind you to make sure no furniture or other items are in your way.

, Locate a sturdy chair that won't slide backward when you sit down. Back up to it and put both crutches in one hand, leaning on them slightly and placing your injured foot in front of you. Use the other hand to steady yourself against the chair and lower yourself into the seat.


Lean the crutches against the wall or a sturdy table with the armpit rests down. They may topple over if you lean them tip-down.When you're ready to stand up, turn the crutches right side up and hold them in the hand on your non-injured side. Hoist yourself up and place your weight on your healthy foot, then pass one crutch to the injured side and balance using the hand grips.

, Face the stairs and hold the handrail with one hand. Tuck the crutches beneath your armpit on the other side. Step up with your good foot and keep your injured foot behind you. Lean on the crutches as you take the next step with your good fit and again bring your injured foot up from behind.


You may want to ask a partner to help you the first few times you take the stairs, since it can be tricky to keep your balance.
If you go up stairs without a railing, place a crutch under each arm. Step up with your good foot, bring your injured foot up, then put your weight on the crutches.

, Hold the crutches under one armpit and grasp the handrail with your other hand. Carefully hop down to the next step. Hop down one step at a time until you reach the bottom.


If the steps don't have a handrail, lower your crutches to the stair below, move your injured leg down, then step down with your other foot with your weight on the hand grips.
To reduce the risk of accidentally taking a topple, you can also seat yourself on the top step, holding your injured foot in front of you, and use your hands to support yourself as you scoot down the steps one stair at a time. You'll have to ask someone to bring the crutches down for you.

"
Be sure that both you and the patient are in a safe location before continuing.,
Check the patient.,
If there is no response, contact emergency services immediately!

,
Check the CABS.",How to Use an AED and Do CPR1," If an AED is available, also check to ensure that the patient is not in standing water and is not located near flammable materials. Do not make yourself another patient!;
, Tap the ground and shout.

,,


C-Chest Compressions- If the patient does not appear to be breathing normally, place your hands in the middle of their chest, between the nipples, and push down at least 2 inches, at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute.
A-Airway- Tilt the patients head back to open the airway.
B-Breathing- Give 2 ventilations, just enough to make the chest rise. This should take no more than 10 seconds.

"
"
Look around your immediate area for an AED (Automated External Defibrillator) such as the one seen above this paragraph.,
If you cannot locate an AED, proceed with CPR.,
Turn on the AED unit.,
Follow the AED's voice prompts.

,
Remove all clothing from the chest, abdomen, and arms (male or female).

,
Peel the pads off and place them exactly as shown.,
Usually the AED will start to immediately analyze the patient's heart rhythm.,
If the AED has a shock advised prompt, push the button.",How to Use an AED and Do CPR2," The location of AEDs may be marked with the symbol shown in the image in the introduction of this article.

, You should instruct bystanders to call emergency services and search for an AED. Staff members in public places such as railway stations or airports will be able to provide instructions and alert any emergency response units or first aid teams that may be present to assist with CPR and Defibrillation.

, Depending on the model of the AED you may have to pull a handle or push the on button.

,,, Accuracy is more important than speed when placing pads.

, If it does not, you might have to push the analyze button. Do not touch the patient during this or any other part of the defibrillation process.

, When you shock, make sure no one is touching the patient. Also, the patient must not be touching metal and there must not be large amounts of water on the chest (sweat is okay). The patient must not be wearing a nitro patch. If the patient has a pacemaker, try not to place the pads directly on the unit.


The AED will shock up to 3 times. Usually one shock is needed. Newer AEDs following recent guidelines will shock only once on the highest energy setting, after which they should prompt you to immediately perform two minutes of CPR.
Some pulse-less heart rhythms cannot be treated by defibrillation. If the AED does not advise a shock, check the pulse, and if there is none, continue CPR.

"
"
Determine what is needed.,
If the person only needs ventilations, blow every 5 seconds.,
If the person needs both treatments, blow 2 times (each breath for 2 seconds)while holding nose shut, then follow up the rib cage and find the top of the rib cage and place down two fingers and start your compressions.",How to Use an AED and Do CPR3," If there is no breathing and no pulse, start chest compressions. If there is a pulse but no breathing, just give ventilation. A person will always have a pulse if he or she is breathing, but one can have a pulse and not be breathing.

, After 2 minutes, check for breathing. If there is no breathing, continue breathing treatment (rescue breathing). If there is breathing, put the patient in the recovery position.

Remove the cap.,
Inspect the inhaler.,
Hold the inhaler upright and shake it 5-10 times.,
Prepare your spacer if you’re using one.,
Take a deep breath.,
Tilt your head back.,
Exhale slowly.,
Place the inhaler or the inhaler with the spacer in your mouth.,
Breathe in as you press down on the canister.,
Hold your breath and count to 10.,
Remove the mouthpiece from your mouth.",How to Use an Inhaler1," The cap is a small covering located over the mouthpiece of the inhaler to prevent foreign objects from getting in the inhaler. Pull the cap to remove it and set it in a safe place.An uncapped inhaler can pick up germs and debris, which you will then pump into your lungs.
Make sure that you don’t lose your cap while you’re using your inhaler.;
, The inhaler should be clean, especially the mouthpiece. Remove the cap and check the inside and outside of the mouthpiece. Check the expiration date to make sure that it can still be used. Wipe any grime or debris off the inhaler with a dry tissue or cotton swab.If the mouthpiece is dirty, wipe it down with rubbing alcohol, and let it dry.

, Hold the inhaler in your hand with your index finger on top of the canister. The mouthpiece should be on the bottom with the top of the canister pointing up. Quickly move your inhaler up and down by pumping your forearm or wrist.If you haven’t used it in a while, make sure that you prime it by pumping it until it sprays at full force. Don’t worry about wasting medicine because an unprimed inhaler will not provide you a full dose, putting your breathing at risk. Instructions for priming vary, so know how many pumps it takes to prime yours.

, Take off the cap and look inside to make sure that there is no grime or debris inside the spacer. If there is, then try blowing it out. If you can’t clear out the debris, you may need to wash your spacer.Don’t wipe your spacer with a cloth because it will create static cling that attracts your medicine.Clean your spacer by dismantling and washing it in mild dish detergent. Allow it to air dry before putting it back together., Breathe in through your mouth. Open your lungs to their maximum capacity, then hold the breath for just a second., You only need to slightly tilt your head back. This will open your airways so that the medicine can easily flow into your lungs. If you bend your head too far back, you may cut off your throat instead of opening it, however., Release the air from your lungs in preparation for inhaling your medicine from the inhaler., The mouthpiece should sit above your tongue and between your teeth. Close your lips around it, and aim the spray hole at the back of your throat.If you’re using a spacer, the mouthpiece on the spacer goes in your mouth, and the mouthpiece of the inhaler fits in the other end of the spacer.If you don’t have a spacer and don’t want to put the inhaler in your mouth, then you can hold it 1-2 inches in front of your mouth.

, Begin inhaling slowly through your mouth as you press down on your inhaler. This will release a dose of your medicine. Keep the mouthpiece in your mouth to help keep the medicine in your mouth. Continue to breathe in for about three to five seconds. Try to push the medication back towards your lungs as you inhale.This movement is known as a ""puff.""


Only press the canister down once.
If you’re holding your inhaler 1-2 inches in front of your mouth, then close your mouth as soon as the dose is delivered.
If you’re using a spacer, some spacers have a whistle on them. Listen for the whistle. If you hear it, you are breathing in too rapidly. If you don’t hear it, you are breathing in at an acceptable rate., Your medicine needs time to work, and exhaling too quickly can allow the medicine to escape. You should aim to hold the medicine in your mouth for at least ten seconds, but try to see if you can wait up to a minute.You only have to count to ten on breaths you take from your inhaler.

, Exhale slowly and deeply through your mouth, and then resume breathing normally. Rinse your mouth with water thoroughly after using the inhaler. Gargle, then spit the water out. If you’re supposed to take two puffs from your inhaler, wait one minute before repeating the process.
Continue to use your inhaler as directed by your doctor. In general, most people take one or two puffs every four to six hours or as needed.
It’s especially important to rinse your mouth if your medication is steroid-based because the medicine can cause a secondary yeast infection in the mouth called thrush. Rinsing your mouth after use will help prevent this."

Select a rectal thermometer for newborns.,
Use an ear thermometer cautiously with toddlers.,
Choose any thermometer for children three years or older.,
Clean the ear first.,
Put a sterile cover on the thermometer's tip.,
Pull the ear back and insert the thermometer.,
Take a reading.,
Understand normal body temperature differences.,
Determine if a fever exists.,
Know when to see your doctor.",How to Use an Ear Thermometer," The best or most appropriate type of thermometer to use to measure body temperature depends mainly on age. From birth to about six months of age, using a regular digital thermometer to take a rectal (anal) temperature is recommended because it's considered the most accurate.Earwax, ear infections, and small, curved ear canals interfere with the accuracy of ear thermometers, so they are not the best types to use for newborns.


Some medical research suggests that temporal artery thermometers are also good options for newborns due to accuracy and reproducibility.
Newborns have lower than normal body temperatures — typically less than 97°F (36 °C), versus a normal of 98.6°F (37°C) in adults.Babies may not regulate their body temperature very well when they're sick, and they may become cooler rather than warmer and feverish.;
, Up to an age of about three years, a rectal thermometer still provides the most accurate readings for core body temperature.You can use an ear thermometer at a younger age to get a general reading (which is better than no reading at all), but until about the age of 3, readings from the rectum, armpit, and temporal artery (in the temple region of the head) are considered more accurate. Mild-to-moderate fevers in toddlers can be more dangerous than in adults, so accuracy during the younger years is especially important.


Ear infections are quite common and occur with regular frequency in babies and toddlers, and that affects the readings of ear thermometers due to the inflammation within the ear. As such, an ear thermometer typically gives too high of a reading with ear infections, so check both ears in the case that one is infected.
Regular digital thermometers can record temperatures from the mouth (under the tongue), armpit or rectum and are appropriate for newborns, toddlers, older kids and adults.

, Beyond the age of three years, kids tend to get fewer ear infections and it's much easier to clean their ears and remove wax build up. Wax in the ear canal prevents ear thermometers from accurately reading the infrared radiation coming off the eardrum.Furthermore, the child's ear canal has grown by this age and become less curved. As such, beyond the age of three years, all types of thermometers used in all parts of the body are pretty comparable in terms of accuracy.


If you use an ear thermometer to take a child's temperature and you're skeptical of the results, then take a rectal temperature with a regular thermometer and compare the results.
Ear thermometers have become much more affordable over the last decade and can be widely found in pharmacies and medical supply stores.

, Because wax build up and other debris in the ear canal can reduce the accuracy of ear thermometers, be sure to clean the ear you're taking a reading from thoroughly. Avoid using a Q-tip or similar method, because the wax or other debris can easily become impacted against the eardrum. The safest and most effective way to clean ears is by using a few drops of warm olive oil, almond oil, mineral oil, or special ear drops to soften the earwax, then rinse it all out (irrigate it) with some squirts of water from a little rubber device made for ear cleaning.Allow the ear canal to dry before proceeding with your reading.


Ear thermometers will give too low of a temperature reading if there is earwax or debris in the ear canal.
Do not use an ear thermometer on an ear that is sore, infected, injured or recovering from surgery.

, Once you take the ear thermometer out of its box and read the instructions, put a disposable sterile cover over the tip. Because you're inserting the tip into the ear canal, you want to make sure it's clean so there's much less risk of causing an ear infection — something that young kids are predisposed to already. If, for some reason, your ear thermometer doesn't include sterile covers or you've run out, then clean the tip with an antiseptic solution such as rubbing alcohol, white vinegar, or hydrogen peroxide.Colloidal silver is an excellent antiseptic and something you can learn to make at home, making it much more economically friendly.
You can re-use thermometer tip covers only if you thoroughly sanitize them. Make sure to clean them after and before each use.

, After turning the hand-held ear thermometer on, try not to move your head (or hold your child's head still) and pull back on the top part of the ear in order to help straighten out the ear canal a little bit and make it easier to insert the tip. More specifically, if it's an adult ear, then gently pull it up and then back; if it's a child's ear, then gently pull it straight back.Straightening the ear canal will help prevent injuring or irritating it with the tip of the thermometer and allow for the most accurate reading.


Follow the directions to ensure that you insert the thermometer the correct distance into the ear canal — there's no need to touch the eardrum (tympanic membrane) because the thermometer is designed to take a remote reading.
The ear thermometer bounces an infrared signal off of the eardrum to read the temperature, so creating a seal around the thermometer by placing it far enough into the canal is important also.

, Once the thermometer has been gently inserted into the ear canal, hold it firmly in place until the thermometer signals that it's taken a reading — typically with a beeping sound. Then slowly and carefully remove the ear thermometer from the ear canal and read the number that's displayed digitally. Write down the temperature reading and don't rely on your memory, because a caregiver or health professional may want or need that information.


It also makes it easier to compare readings over a specific period of time if you're monitoring a fever.
An advantage of using an ear thermometer is that, when positioned properly, they are quick and fairly accurate., Not every area in the body is supposed to have the same temperature at all times. For example, while the average normal oral (under the tongue) temperature of an adult is 98.6 °F (37 °C), ear (tympanic) temperature is typically 0.5 to 1 °F higher and can hover close to 100 °F (37.8 °C) and be considered normal. Furthermore, normal body temperature varies depending on gender, activity levels, food and beverage consumption, time of day, and stage of menstruation.So consider these factors if trying to determine if you or someone else has a fever.


For an adult, in reality, normal body temperature ranges from 97.8 °F (36.6 °C) to slightly under 100 °F (37.8 °C).
Research indicates that temperature discrepancies as much as 1 °F in either direction can occur with ear thermometers when compared with rectal readings, the most accurate way of measuring., Due to all the factors mentioned above, and the fact that there may be some thermometer error and/or poor measuring technique, try to take multiple readings, ideally with different types of thermometers in different parts of the body. Compare all the readings and average them out. Furthermore, understand the other common indicators of mild-to-moderate fevers, such as: sweating while inactive, headache, achy muscles, weakness, loss of appetite and increased thirst.A single ear reading from a thermometer should not be used to determine the course of action or treatment.
Children can be very ill without a fever, or appear normal with a temperature a little over 100 °F (37.8 °C) — don't make conclusions just based on numbers; look for other symptoms.

, Fevers are common symptoms of illness, but that's not usually a bad thing as they seem to play a key role in fighting infections.Although an ear temperature of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or greater is considered a fever, if your child is older than one year and is drinking lots of fluids, playful and sleeping normally, there's usually no reason or need to treat it. However, temperatures of around 102 °F (38.9 °C) or greater combined with symptoms such as unusual irritability, discomfort, lethargy, and moderate-to-severe coughing and/or diarrhea, then a trip to the doctor is certainly warranted.Symptoms of high fevers (103 °F – 106 °F or 39.4 °C – 41.1 °C) often include: hallucinations, confusion, severe irritability and convulsions, and are usually considered medical emergencies.Your doctor may recommend acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Children's Motrin, others) to help reduce a fever. However, ibuprofen can't be given before 6 months of age and aspirin should not be given to anyone younger than 18 years due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.

Take a deep breath to inhale the medicine.,
Hold your breath to keep in the medicine.,
Remove the inhaler from your mouth.,
Close the inhaler.,
Rinse out your mouth.",How to Use an Inhaler2," Your DPI may get ruined in a humid or moist environment because the medicine becomes clumpy, clogging the inhaler. To prevent your medicine from clumping, don’t store your DPI in the bathroom or in an area without air conditioning. Your breath also contains moisture, so it’s also important that you don’t exhale into the inhaler., The cap protects your inhaler from becoming dirty or contaminated. When you’re using the inhaler, make sure to put your cap down somewhere safe so that you don’t lose it. Depending on what kind of inhaler you have, the cap will look different.If your inhaler looks like an upright tube - called a “rocket” inhaler - then the cap will cover the length of the inhaler. It may be a different color than the base.If you have a diskus inhaler - called a “flying saucer” inhaler - you will remove the cap by placing your thumb on the thumb grip and pressing away from you. The cap will slide away to remove the mouthpiece., The medicine is already in the inhaler, but with a DPI you must release it into the delivery chamber before you can use it. This keeps your medicine dry. Depending on whether you have a rocket or a diskus, how you load the inhaler will differ.

Do not shake your inhaler.
If you have a rocket inhaler, twist the base as far to the right as it will go, and then as far to the left as it will go. You will hear a click when the medicine is loaded.If you have a diskus inhaler, slide the lever away from you until it clicks. The click tells you that your medicine has properly loaded.If your model is a twisthaler inhaler, then the medicine will load when you take off the cap. There is no need to do anything else.If you’re still having trouble, then check with the directions for your model because DPIs vary more in how they’re used compared with other inhalers.

, Stand up or sit up straight with your head tilted slightly back., While holding your inhaler away from your mouth, inhale deeply. Then exhale, completely emptying your lungs.Make sure that you do not exhale into the inhaler as this can ruin your dose.

, The mouthpiece should be between your teeth and your tongue. Close your lips around the mouthpiece to create a seal., You do not need to press anything because the medicine is ready to be inhaled. Inhale as deeply as you can so that the medicine is able to get into your lungs., Leave the inhaler in your mouth while you count to ten., Before you exhale, remove the inhaler and turn your face away from it. Let out your breath and then breath normally., Put the cap back on your rocket or twisthaler inhaler or slide the cap shut if you’re using a diskus inhaler.If you are supposed to take a second dose, repeat steps 3-10 to deliver a second dose.

, Gargle with water to remove any excess medicine that might remain in your mouth to prevent an infection from developing."

Talk to your healthcare provider about your needs.,
Choose a cool mist humidifier instead of a warm steam vaporizer if you have concerns about safety.,
Evaluate your household needs.,
Review the various types of steam vaporizers.",How to Use a Vaporizer1," Your doctor will discuss your symptoms, if any, as well as any environmental concerns about your home. They will also offer advice about appropriate next steps, like a vaporizer or humidifier.


Sufferers of acute (short-term) respiratory illnesses, such as cold, flu, or bronchitis, might find temporary relief of symptoms while using a vaporizer.Those with chronic respiratory diseases may find a vaporizer useful, though your healthcare provider may recommend more specialized devices.
Vaporizers may also be useful in homes with very dry air or in very cold/dry climates, as they add moisture to the air for greater general comfort.
Be sure to ask your doctor about potential side effects of steam use, such as increased bacterial growth or other problems with humid air.;
, The two devices work in similar fashion, but offer slightly different benefits for your health and home environment. You'll need to consider for whom and for what purpose you're purchasing one of these devices.


Warm steam vaporizers use heat to turn water into steam to add moisture to the environment.
Cool mist humidifiers emit a light mist of cool water into the air, also adding moisture.
Note that the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advises against using steam vaporizers in children’s rooms., Determining in which room you will place the device will help you to decide on the device type and size you will purchase.


If the vaporizer is for a child, make sure you have space in his/her room that will keep the machine out of reach.
If you're purchasing the vaporizer to improve the atmosphere in your home in general, choose which room will mostly likely offer the most benefit for you and your family.

, Taking some time to read the package information and, possibly, looking at the actual vaporizer, will help you make a more informed decision about your health and comfort.


Consider the amount of space that you have to keep and store the vaporizer. Larger varieties may be difficult to keep out of the reach of children, although smaller machines may not provide enough steam to be useful.
Read the packaging and, if purchasing online, device reviews, to get a sense of how easy the vaporizer is to use and to clean. If you have a busy schedule or have health issues that make strenuous cleaning difficult, choose a machine with simpler operating instructions.

Check the ABC's: Airway, breathing and circulation.,
Apply traction and maintain traction through the entire process.,
Find two long branches or sticks.,
Put the forked end of the sticks at the top near the chest or armpit and the crotch or groin.,
Cut or dig out notches in the bottom of the sticks to make a groove for a short stick that you will need to find to become a cross member that will be used later.,
Take some rope or anything else that you can use as a tie, and start securing the long branches to the body.,
Find one last piece of rope and starting in the middle, wrap it around the ankle, so the tag ends of this rope will be dangling.,
Locate a short stubby stick that you can put in between the ""V"" of the rope from the ankle to the cross member.,
Stop twisting once the legs are equal length, and then secure the short winching stick to the cross member so that it does not twist back and reverse what you just did.

,
Continue to monitor your work and make sure that traction is maintained.",How to Make a Traction Splint for a Fractured Femur," Trauma significant enough to snap a femur is likely strong enough to cause other issues, possibly even rendering the victim unconscious. If this is the case, you must make sure he has an open airway, is breathing (with or without intervention) and he has a pulse.;
, This is going to require an additional rescuer. Grab the ankle, straighten the foot and pull, keeping this traction until the traction splint is done.

, It would be preferable to find them forked on one end, each of them. One of the branches should be considerably longer than the other, as the longer one will run the outside of the leg from the chest area down. The shorter stick will run from the groin or crotch down. They should both end at the same point below the foot. These branches should be significant, about 1.5 - 2 inches (4 - 5 cm) thick.

, These areas need to be heavily padded with whatever padding you have available. There will be a lot of pressure exerted in these areas.

, Use some cloth or rope and tie this shorter stick between the two and securely in the groove you cut out.

, Obviously, a lot longer material will be needed at the chest and everywhere above the waist. Be sure to not tie on the knee, but well above and below it, and not on the site of the break either, but above and below it as well.

, You will take these two tag ends and tie them securely to the cross member. You now have a ""V"" shape from the cross member to the ankle.

, Start twisting this stick, causing the ropes to start winding around each other, thereby pulling the ankle down closer to the cross member. You will notice that the injured leg is starting to become as long as the uninjured one.

,, It is likely that some traction will be lost, so you will want to add another twist or two in order to maintain proper traction. You also need to periodically check for swelling or discoloration, feeling and pulse in the toes and foot to make sure that circulation is not being cut off.

Read the manufacturer's instructions.,
Use the vaporizer at night.,
Fill the container with distilled water.,
Place the vaporizer on a flat surface at a safe distance from human contact.,
Plug the vaporizer in and turn it on.,
Air the room out in between uses.While a warm, moist environment can work wonders for congestion, bacteria and mold can start growing in a room that stays moist for too long.",How to Use a Vaporizer2," While the machines may be similar in many ways, care and use requirements may differ. The instructions should also tell you how to disassemble and clean the vaporizer.

, While you may use a vaporizer at any time, most users prefer to run the machine at night. As the machines ease dryness or stuffiness in nasal passages, users may experience a more comfortable sleep.


Avoid running the vaporizer all day since you will fill the air with too much moisture doing so, which may cause increased mold or fungus growth in your home. These problems may lead to further respiratory issues.
Never allow your home's interior humidity exceed 50%.Purchase an interior hygrometer to measure the humidity in your home's air.

, Tap water contains minerals, and some of these minerals can clog up the machine or spread dust and contaminants through the air in your home.Most vaporizers have a ""fill line"" marking how high the water level should be. Don't overfill the tank, as doing so may cause spills.
Some vaporizers will automatically shut off once the tank is empty, but you should plan to fill it each time you plan to begin using the device, such as at bedtime.

, You should place the vaporizer about 4 feet (122 cm) away from direct contact with anyone’s skin.The hot mist from a steam vaporizer can cause scalding if it comes into contact with skin, especially for an extended length of time.


If using the vaporizer in a child's room or in a home with children, place it high up on a surface that the child cannot reach to prevent accidental scalding. You should also make sure that the surface is sturdy enough to withstand vibrations that might dislodge the vaporizer.
Do not use or place the vaporizer in an area that would allow bedding, curtain, carpeting, or other fabric materials to get wet. You may want to spread towels out beneath the machine to prevent dripping water or condensation from damaging the surface of your furniture.

, Some vaporizers turn on as soon as they are plugged in. For the most part, though, there will be a switch, button, or dial that you will need to flip in order to turn the machine on.

,


If bacteria or mold starts to grow, you and your family will probably experience more respiratory problems.
Leave doors and, if possible, windows open during the day when the steam vaporizer is not in use. Run an electric fan, if necessary, to keep the air circulating inside the room.

"
"
Read the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions.,
Clean the vaporizer regularly.,
Create or purchase a cleaning solution.,
Take the vaporizer apart.,
Scrub the inside of the tank with a soft brush or cloth.,
Rinse the inside of the tank.,
Dry the inside of the tank with a clean microfiber cloth or paper towel.",How to Use a Vaporizer3," These instructions should indicate how often you should clean the device, as well as list the chemicals safe to use for cleaning.


To clean most vaporizers, you will need cleaning solution, a bottle or vegetable brush, clean water, and a microfiber cloth or paper towels.
Consider purchasing rubber gloves to protect your skin as you clean.

, Bacteria grow in moist environments, and if the vaporizer is not cleaned and dried properly, bacteria can actually begin growing inside the machine. If bacteria grow inside the vaporizer, it will be transferred into the air as the machine creates steam.Change the distilled water every day and clean the machine at least once every three days.Clean more often if you use the device during the day as well as at night.

, A few squirts of antibacterial soap or mild dish detergent mixed into hot water is usually sufficient. For something stronger, use three percent hydrogen peroxide.If the particular vaporizer you use specifies a cleaning solution you should use, follow the manufacturer's instructions and use the recommended type.
For an especially deep cleaning, use 1% bleach solution: one part bleach to nine parts water.
Wear rubber gloves to protect your skin when cleaning with any variety of bleach.

, Follow the manufacturer's instructions on disassembling the machine. Usually, the only part of the machine you need to take apart for cleaning purposes is the tank.


Check the tank and base for signs of mold growth. If you need to clean the base, use care not to submerge any mechanical parts; use a wet brush dipped in cleaning solution and dry with a cloth instead.
On some models, the machine is not designed to be disassembled. For these steam humidifiers, you will only need to open the lid or cover of the water tank and attempt to clean it while it is still connected to the rest of the machine.
Use only gentle pressure to disassemble the machine. Use of too much force may damage the locking components and make the machine unsafe for use.

, A baby bottle brush or vegetable brush should suffice, but a clean, microfiber cloth works just as well. Dip the brush or cloth into the cleaning solution and thoroughly scrub the inside of the water tank, re-soaking the cloth in solution as necessary until the entire tank has been scrubbed clean.

, You can either use tap water or distilled water. Pour a little water into the water tank, swish it around, and dump it immediately to rid the tank of any soap or detergent.


Rinse the tank thoroughly, then soak the components in white vinegar to fully disinfect the device.
Use a toothpick to clean any visible mold from the narrower tubes and valves, as necessary.

, The tank should be completely dry in order to prevent contamination of the machine with germs or minerals from the water. This is especially important when you are preparing to put the vaporizer back into storage.


Paper towels are the most hygienic option, as they are fresh with each use, unlike towels, which can trap and spread germs.
Let the tank fully air dry before reattaching to the base.

Collect all the components to aquire an ultrasound image.,
Turn the machine on and load the software.,
Connect the transducer to the machine.,
Prepare the probe.,
Lightly press the transducer onto the surface of the tissue.,
Adjust the image.,
Freeze the image.,
Save the image.,
Interpret the image.,
Wipe the gel off of the transducer.,
Put the plastic cover back onto the transducer.,
Store in a safe place.",How to Use an Ultrasound Transducer," This includes a transducer, computer, ultrasound gel and the object to image.


Gather all of your items at first so that you will not have to run around trying to find things.
Wash your hands if they are dirty.;
, This might be on a PC, laptop or a medical imaging computer. The software is where you will see the image.


Different machines have different techniques. Get to know your machine and where things are placed.
There are many different softwares to run an ultrasound. For research purposes, MATLAB is very common.

, Insert the transducer into the transducer port and lock it by turning the knob vertically. This locks the transducer into place. In order to remove the transducer, simply turn the knob horizontally and remove.


Freeze the screen on your program before you do this.
Push a little harder or wiggle it around if the transducer does not go into the port perfectly.

, Ultrasound gel is always used between the head of the probe and the object being imaged. The gel makes it easier to see the image.


Apply a gracious, half a centimeter thick layer over the top surface.
There is never too much gel, only too little.

, The gel might feel cold to the patient but does not do any harm. Unfreeze the frame on the computer once the transducer is touching the object.


Move the transducer around while looking at the image on the computer.
Locate the place you want to take the image. Zeroing in on your focal point might take some time. Be sure to practice so that you can find what you are looking for faster.

, Increase or decrease the brightness or contrast in order to obtain a clearer picture. Play around with the settings on your device. Some settings might be better to use than others; it really depends on what you are imaging.


You know that it is a good image if the focal point is in the middle of the frame and there is a good contrast between light and dark areas.

, This is the same button you used to freeze the image before firing the transducer. Congrats! You created an ultrasound image!

, In order to save the image you took, find the save button and save the image onto a certain place on your computer for easy access later.


Patients might want a copy of their ultrasound. To to this, find the print button and send the image to a printer.

, Look at the color differences.


Ultrasound is usually black and white.
The white is solid tissues like bones because they reflect more light.
The blacker area is less dense and can be liquids or lumen like a uterus.

, Use a delicate wipe such as a tissue.


There are ultrasound tissues that you may buy which will provide minimal scratching on the head of the transducer.
Wipe softly but firmly.
Make sure all the gel is off before getting ready to store it.

, This will help to protect anything that may accidentally fall on the head.


The top surface of the transducer is very soft and any scratch or spill might damage the quality of the image.

, This includes a place that is safe from knocking the probe down.


The probe should always be cool and dry.
If other people are sharing the probe, make sure they also know safe storage protocols.

Read books, articles, websites and blogs about electricity and safety measures to take when working with electricity.In basic terms, electricity naturally tries to flow to the earth or ground through any and all materials that will conduct an electrical current.Certain compounds, like wood and glass, are poor conductors of electricity. Other materials, like seawater and many metals, conduct very well. The human body is able to conduct a current largely due to the amount of sodium and water in the body, and an electric shock happens when electricity flows through parts of the body.This happens most often when a direct source of electricity is exposed to human contact. It may also flow into a person through another conductor, like a pool of water or a metal pole.To learn more about electricity and the cause of electric shock, read about it here or ask a trusted electrician.;

However, any time you are having serious or major electrical issues, you should hire a professional electrician. It may be expensive, but it is cheaper than a stint in the hospital.There are essentially two types of electricians you can hire, “master” electricians and “journeyman” electricians. Both types are usually licensed by the state - but not always. Master electricians generally own businesses and can employ other licensed electricians and helpers or apprentices, while journeyman electricians can work for a master electrician or be self-employed and hire a single helper or apprentice. The rules of what each type of electrician may do and may not do varies by state, county or locality.

, The items and appliances in your household all have their own electrical requirements. Know the specific types of circuit breakers, fuses, and even lightbulbs that are required in your home. Make sure to replace them with the right parts when needed. Using incompatible parts could cause the equipment to function improperly, create an unsafe condition that may result in fire, injury or death., The first step that you need to take before attempting to fix any electrical problems yourself is to turn the electricity off in your home. This helps to ensure that, even if you make a mistake, you won’t be electrocuted.There will be a main electrical panel somewhere in your home (usually in a basement or garage). This panel has a simple on/off switch that allows you to cut the flow of electricity to your entire house. Make sure the switch on this panel is flipped to “off” before attempting any repairs., Covering outlets with wall panels is crucial for preventing accidental contact with wires, and is required by code. If you live with small children, it is also wise to use socket safety plugs to keep curious fingers safe from injury., GFCI, or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter, devices are able to detect imbalances in the amount of electricity flowing through an appliance and will cut off power at the GFCI device. GFCI receptacles are required in most new construction homes, and can typically be installed in older homes for a low cost., There are a handful of common mistakes people make when attempting to make electrical fixes in their homes. You need to be aware of these mistakes and take all the necessary precautions to avoid them. Some things to avoid are:


Avoid touching a bare wire that may be conducting a current.
Avoid overloading power strips and other receptacles with multiple plugs. Using only two plugs per outlet lessens the risk of shock and fire.Utilize three-prong plugs whenever possible. The third prong, which grounds the electrical current, should never be removed.
Never assume that someone else turned off the power source. Always check for yourself!

, Store and use electric devices away from water. Water and electricity do not mix well and appliances should always be kept away from any moisture. This will prevent any accidental shocks from occurring.


Never use an electrical appliance while in the bath or shower.If your toaster or another electric appliance is near your kitchen sink, never use the running water and the appliance at the same time. Keep it unplugged when not in use.Store outdoor electrical equipment in a place where it will be kept dry, like a garage shelf.If a plugged-in appliance falls into water, do not attempt to retrieve it until you turn off power to the corresponding circuit. Once the power is off, you may retrieve the device. Once it is dry, it can be evaluated by an electrician to see if it is suitable for future use., Pay attention to the condition of your electric devices, and maintain them regularly. Some signs that indicate a need for repair are:Sparking
Issuing of small shocks
Frayed or damaged cords
Heat from electrical outlets
Recurrent short-circuiting
These are only a few signs of wear and tear. If something else seems strange, contact an electrician. It's always better to be safe than sorry!

, Once you have made the necessary repairs and are ready to test the appliance or outlet you have fixed, turn the power switch on your main panel back to the “on” position. You may need to reset your circuit breakers as well. To do this, flip the switch on each individual breaker to “off”, then flip it back to “on”., Whenever a project involves exposure to electrical equipment or electricity, check and double-check that the power is off before beginning your work.Again, there should be a main electric panel for the entire facility. Find this panel and flip the switch to off., Rubber soled shoes and non-conductive gloves provide a barrier. Putting a rubber mat on the floor is another effective precaution. Rubber does not conduct electricity and will help you avoid getting shocked., Make sure that all of your tools have a three-pronged plug, and inspect all equipment for signs of damage. It is also important to turn off power tools before connecting them to electricity. Always keep power tools away from water, and clear the work area of flammable gasses, vapors, and solvents when tools are in use., It is always wise to have a second person around to assist you when working with electricity. This second person can double check to ensure you have followed all necessary precautions. Also, if something does go wrong and you do get shocked, this second person can immediately get you the help you need.Make sure you communicate well with this other person. Many electrical accidents occur because of miscommunication. You need to be able to trust that when this person says the power is off, it is actually off.Even if you trust this other person with your life, it is probably a good idea to double check and make sure the power is off for yourself. Never assume anything when dealing with electricity., Working with electricity is inherently dangerous and complicated. If you are not completely confident in your skills, bring in a trusted electrician to complete the job., It may sound obvious, but making sure you have a clear forecast for your outdoor adventure is crucial to avoid getting caught in an electrical storm. Even if you're just gone for an afternoon, weather can change quickly and the best prevention is preparedness. Know the chance of a thunderstorm in the outdoor area you plan to visit, and plan to head in long before the lightning is due to start., Pay attention to changes in temperature, increases in wind, or darkening of the sky. Listen for thunder. If it looks like a storm is rolling in, stop what you are doing and take shelter immediately. , If you are outside and a storm approaches, quickly heading indoors is the only real way to be protected from lightning. Look for a completely enclosed shelter with its own electricity and plumbing, like a house or business. If that option is not available, hiding out in a car with the doors closed and windows up is also a safe bet. Covered picnic areas, stand-alone restroom facilities, tents, and other small structures will not keep you safe. No reliable shelter in sight? Reduce your risk with these preventive guidelines:Stay lowAvoid open areasAvoid metal and water, Whether indoors or out, do not leave your chosen safety area for at least half an hour after the last clap of thunder is heard. If you have any doubts about whether or not the storm has passed, stay inside. , Keep a fire extinguisher ready to go in areas where you work with electrical equipment. Fire extinguishers for use on electrical fires will have a ""C,"" ""BC,"" or ""ABC"" on the label., No matter how many precautions are in place, electric shock is always a risk when electricity is in use. If shock occurs, it is important to be prepared in order to handle the situation safely., In the case of an electric emergency, always call the Emergency Services. It is unwise to try to treat the victim yourself when an electrical shock has occurred., Shock victims usually don’t hold the electricity in their bodies for very long. However, you must always use caution, as the victim could potentially still be conducting electricity. Use a non-conductive barrier, like rubber gloves, if at all possible, to touch or move the victim., If you can do so without being shocked yourself, turn off the power. If this is not possible, move the victim away from the source with a non-conductive material, like a piece of wood.You should only try to move an electrical shock victim if the person is in immediate danger., Once you are certain the victim is no longer conducting electricity, check to see if the person is breathing. If the victim is not breathing, begin CPR immediately while someone else alerts emergency medical services.OSHA’s safety rules for working around electricity state that you have about 4 minutes to get help for an electric shock victim, so move quickly., Stay calm and keep the victim lying horizontally, with his legs slightly elevated until medical help can arrive. Once help arrives, stay out of the paramedics’ way. If the paramedics ask for any assistance, follow their instructions."

Be gentle with the patient.,
Handle the otoscope properly.,
Straighten the ear canal.,
Choose the right speculum size.,
Insert the otoscope slowly into the ear canal.,
Push the speculum 1 to 2 centimeters into the canal.,
Angle the otoscope.,
Remove the otoscope.,
Throw away the speculum.,
Recognize the signs of a healthy ear.,
Detect abnormalities.,
Seek medical attention.",How to Use an Otoscope," The ear is a very sensitive organ and can injure easily if improperly examined. Avoid pulling, pushing, or generally being rough with the patient you are examining. This can calm your patient and minimize the risk of injury from sudden movements.Ask your patient if the pressure is acceptable to them. For example, “Is the pressure I’m using ok, Mr. Neumaier? Let me know if you have any discomfort.”;
, Hold your otoscope between your thumb and pointer finger like a pen or pencil. Use your thumb as a fulcrum to aid your examination of the various parts of the ear.Hold the otoscope in the right hand to examine the right ear and the left hand for the left ear.Practice using your otoscope with both hands. It may make examinations easier since you need to keep the otoscope in one hand and hold the ear with the other., Use your opposite hand to gently pull the outer ear up and back on patients older than 12 months. Straightening your patient’s ear canal can make it easier to examine the ears.Pull the outer ear down and back for babies under 12 months.
Grasp the ear at the 10 o’clock position when examining the right ear and the 2 o’clock position for the left., Put a new speculum, or pointed end, onto your otoscope before each patient. Select the largest possible speculum that your patient’s ear will accommodate. When inserted, the speculum should fit snugly into the outer third of the ear canal. Speculums that are too small can cause discomfort and reduce how much of the ear you can examine. Use the following guidelines for speculum size:Adults: 4 to 6 millimeters
Children: 3 to 4 millimeters
Infants: as small as 2 millimeters

, Place the otoscope at your patients ear, not in it.Look into your otoscope and then slowly insert the pointed end of it into the ear canal. Steady your hand on the side of the individuals face if necessary. Slow and gentle insertion can prevent unwanted movement in your patient. It also keeps your hand and scope in line with the ear and minimizes the risk of injury.Avoid putting too much pressure on the otoscope, which can cause the patient discomfort.

, Avoid ramming the speculum into the ear canal. Insert it at most 1 to 2 centimeters and then use the light to view beyond the tip of the speculum. Stop the examination immediately if the patient expresses any pain or discomfort., Angle the tip of the otoscope towards the person’s nose. This follows the normal angle of the ear canal. From here, move the otoscope gently at different angles. This allows you to view the person’s eardrum and canal walls. Stop the exam at any sign of increased pain or discomfort., Return the otoscope back to your starting position. As you watch through the speculum, gentle take the speculum and scope out of the person’s ear canal and outer ear. Release the person’s ear from your grasp., Remove the speculum from the otoscope. Throw it away in a certified medical waste container to minimize the spread of disease or infection to other patients.If you don’t have disposable speculums, scrub each tip with hot water to remove excess wax. Then soak the speculum in a covered dish of rubbing alcohol for 10 minutes.

, Ears can vary in size, shape, and color. However, healthy ears have the same general characteristics. Recognizing these signs can help you quickly examine your patient and identity potential problem areas. The following are signs of a healthy ear canal and eardrum:The ear canal should be the color of skin with tiny hairs. It may have some yellowish brown or reddish brown earwax, which is normal.
The eardrum should be pearly white or grey and translucent. You should see tiny bones pushing on the eardrum and a cone of light visible at the 5 o'clock position in the right ear and the 7 o'clock position in the left

, Infected or diseased ears also exhibit a variety of general symptoms. Identify abnormalities during your examination. This can help you get prompt treatment for potential problems. Look for the following abnormalities in the ear canal and eardrum that may signal a problem:Wiggling or pulling on the outer ear cases pain or discomfort. The ear canal may also be red, tender, swollen or filled with pus.
The eardrum may have little or no light reflection. You may also see redness bulging, visible amber liquid or bubbles behind the eardrum. There may also be visible hole(s), whitish scars on the surface of the eardrum, wax blockage, and blockage with an object such as a bean or bug.

, Schedule an appointment with a medical doctor if you are performing an exam and are not trained to diagnose medical conditions. This can ensure that you or your patients get a proper diagnosis and prompt treatment for infections or other conditions that can affect your ear. Seek medical attention for any of the following visible abnormalities in the ear:Inflammation
Pus
A dull or red eardrum
Fluid or bubbles behind the eardrum
A hole in the eardrum
Foreign objects or impacted wax

Don’t pick your nose.,
Blow your nose rarely and gently.,
Avoid non-prescription nasal sprays and certain oral medicines.,
Cut down on your use of aspirin.",How to Prevent Nose Bleeds1," By far the most common type of nosebleeds are anterior nosebleeds, when the bleeding comes from the lower septum, the wall between the two channels of your nose. This area has a lot of sensitive blood vessels that can bleed profusely when irritated. Picking your nose is one of the prime irritations that can cause these kinds of nosebleeds.


You should generally avoid picking your nose if you want to lower your chance of nosebleeds.
Ensure you trim your nails regularly, so if you do happen to pick your nose, you are less likely to irritate it.;
, You can irritate your nose by picking it, but blowing your nose hard can also lead to nosebleeds. Blow your nose sparingly, and when you do blow it, be gentle and avoid using a lot of force.If you are suffering from a cold or allergies, and are blowing your nose more frequently than usual, this might provoke a nosebleed.Vigorously rubbing your nose, or any other kind of physical irritation, or trauma, can also lead to nosebleeds., Antihistamines, decongestants, and other medical but non-prescribed nasal sprays can be a cause of nosebleeds. Excessive use of these products can dry out the inside of your nose, leading to cracking and bleeding.In addition, many oral antihistamines and decongestants can lead to dryness of your nasal passages and may increase nosebleeds. If these medicines help you deal with allergies, try to moderate your use if they are contributing to nosebleeds, or talk to your doctor about other options.

, If you are regularly taking aspirin, and begin to suffer nosebleeds there could be a connection. Medicines, such as aspirin and anticoagulants, cause you to bleed more easily, and this can heighten the risk of a nosebleed occurring.If you have been prescribed something and think it may be causing nosebleeds, talk to your doctor.
Do not stop taking prescribed medication unless your doctor tells you to. Stopping these medications could lead to serious health complications. If you can't avoid taking aspirin or anticoagulants, talk to your doctor about the best ways to prevent and treat nosebleeds.

Assess the situation.,
Determine what the child needs.,
Position the child for CPR.,
Position the head for rescue breathing.,
Provide rescue breaths.,
Clear the airway if necessary.,
Continue rescue breathing.",How to Provide Rescue Breathing for a Child," This stage is critical for determining what kind of assistance the child needs and if the assistance can be provided safely. You should:Check the area to make sure it is safe to provide rescue breathing. Make sure you are not in an area where you and the child are in danger of being hit by a car or coming in contact with live electrical wires.
Check the child. Gently touch the child and ask loudly if the child is ok. Do not shake or move the child because if she has a neck or spinal injury, this could cause more damage.
If the child does not respond shout for a bystander to call emergency responders. If people are standing around watching you, point to someone specifically and tell that person to call for help. If you are alone, perform rescue breathing for two minutes and then call 911.;
, At this point it is critical to assess whether the child is breathing and has a pulse:Check for breathing. Lean over the child so that your ear is near the child’s nose and mouth. Watch the child’s chest for breathing movements, listen for sounds of breathing, and notice whether you feel the child’s breath on your cheek. Check for breathing for no more than 10 seconds.
Feel for a pulse. Press your index and middle finger on the side of the child’s neck, under the jaw.

, It is important that this step be done carefully, especially if there is the possibility that the child might have a spinal or neck injury. Avoid causing the child’s neck or body to twist. Position the child so he is lying flat on her back.


If necessary, ask someone to help you gently roll the child onto his back. Coordinate your movements so that the spine is not twisted during the movement.

, The head should be straight and not tilted to either side. Perform the following movements to open the airway and make the rescue breaths as effective as possible:Put one hand under the child’s chin and the other on the top of the head. Gently tilt the head back and lift the chin.
Use your thumb and forefinger to close the child’s nose. If the child is younger than one year, you don’t need to do this because you will breathe into both the child’s nose and mouth.
Do not move the head more than necessary if you think the child may have a spinal cord injury.

, Take breath and lean over the child so that your lips are over her mouth and form an airtight seal. If the child is younger than one year, cover both the nose and the mouth with your mouth. Breathe gently and steadily into the child’s mouth for one to one and a half seconds, watching for the chest to rise.After exhaling into the child’s mouth turn your head and watch to see if the chest deflates as it would during natural breathing. If so, this suggests that the breath was effective and the airway is not blocked.
If you have a barrier mask with a one-way valve, wear it while providing breathing assistance. This will protect you from any infections that the child may have.

, If the airway is obstructed, you may see that the breath you exhale doesn’t inflate the lungs. You may also feel that it blows back in your face instead of going into the child’s body. If this is the case, you need to check for an obstruction.Open the child’s mouth. Look inside to see if you see any pieces of food or objects that the child may have choked on. If so, remove them.
Do not poke your fingers or any other object deep into the child’s throat. If you do, you run the risk of pushing an object further in.
If you don't see an object, reposition the child's head and try another rescue breath. Consider performing maneuvers for possible choking or foreign bodies if you cannot get air in.

, Continue rescue breathing, giving one breath every three seconds for the child. Check for a pulse every two minutes while doing rescue breathing, and to perform regular CPR with chest compressions if the child loses her pulse. Continue with rescue breathing until one of the following occurs:The child begins breathing on her own. You will notice that she is improving if she starts coughing or moving.
Emergency responders arrive. At that point, they will take over.

Call emergency services.,
Take care of the injured person first.,
Control bleeding.,
Take steps to prevent shock.,
Be aware of how the type of injury affects the potential for reattachment.,
Act quickly but carefully.,
Gently wash the severed limb with sterile water or saline solution.Rinse, but do not scrub.,
Wrap the limb in a moist, clean material.Sterile gauze moistened with sterile saline solution or sterile water is best.,
Wrap the limb again, this time in a watertight material.,
Keep the limb cold.,
Get to a hospital immediately.",How to Preserve a Severed Limb," You must immediately call emergency services if someone has suffered the loss of a limb. If an injury has occurred where there is no phone service, or emergency services cannot be contacted or will be unable to reach the victim, do everything you can to get the victim somewhere where you can get them additional help.;
, Do not expend any attention, energy, or time on a severed limb until the injured person has been tended to. Only once breathing and circulation have been stabilized should you turn your attention to an amputated body part.Attending to the injured person must take complete precedence. The rest of this section provides some basic advice on emergency medical services.


If it is only you and the injured person, abandon the limb and focus all of your attention on the injury. The chances of reattachment are small, and the limb should be forgotten entirely if retrieving it in any way jeopardizes the safety of the injured person.
Do not overlook injuries that are less apparent than the amputation.Most importantly, the victim must be treated for any airway or breathing issues, shock, bleeding, and infection prevention.Do not attempt to push any body part back into place., Apply direct pressure on the wound. Raise the injured area above the heart by laying the patient down if possible. Adjust and reapply pressure if bleeding continues. If substantial bleeding continues, a tight bandage or tourniquet can be used to apply the necessary amounts of direct pressure to close the wound.


Be aware that using a tight bandage or tourniquet may ultimately damage tissue and prevent reattachment but must be employed if necessary to prevent persistent bleeding and keep the injured person alive.Apply a direct pressure dressing firmly over the site and watch for it to bleed through. If it does, then apply a tourniquet immediately.
If you apply a tourniquet, apply it within two to four inches of the injury site.
Be advised that an amputated limb may not bleed profusely early in the incident, as blood vessels retract into the body as a self-defense mechanism. This DOES NOT mean there is no need to apply direct pressure, position the injury or the patient, etc. Bleeding will commence and be severe.

, Keep the injured person warm by covering them with a coat or blanket. Lay the injured person down on flat ground. Raise the feet about 12 inches to maintain circulation and blood flow to vital organs.Do not place the person in this position if a head, neck, back, or leg injury is suspected, as moving them may injure them further.Do not place the injured victim in any position that increases their discomfort or impedes their breathing.
Attempt to calm and reassure the injured person. While this may seem trite, it can have a significant effect on preventing the person from going into shock.
Keep in mind that patients suffering this sort of traumatic injury can be susceptible to fast mood swings, anger, panic, etc. Do not take these things personally. Do not engage with the patient in discussing the situation. Just make general comments about the fact EMS has been called and you are with them. Try to avoid saying things like ""You're ok,"" as this can trigger more panic.

, If the injury was caused by heavy machinery or a vehicular accident, it is extremely unlikely that the limb can be reattached, as substantial tissue damage has likely occurred.If the limb is severely damaged or contaminated, know that it will almost certainly not be re-attachable. Reattachment is more likely if the injury occurred via a sharp, clean cut, such as that from a guillotine or sharp industrial blade.

, Proper preservation is absolutely vital. Know that no body part is too small to be potentially reattached., If you do not have clean water or if washing the limb is not possible for another reason, skip this step.


Do not submerge a severed limb in water, as this may cause damage that could hinder reattachment., If you do not have gauze, compromise by wrapping the limb in the cleanest absorbent material available.


A clean t-shirt is a good second-best option. A blanket can work too, but do not use anything that is unclean. Clean maxi pads or adult diapers are also quite effective for larger amputations
Do not moisten the material with anything other than saline solution or clean water. Wrapping the limb in a clean, dry material is better than using any unclean liquid to moisten the material.
Paper towel will work if you do not have gauze or a clean cloth.
A strip of tent material, sleeping bag, or hammock can be used if nothing else is available. The goal of this step (in combination with the next step) is to protect the limb from damage from the ice bath you will use to cool the limb.

, A watertight plastic container or resealable plastic bag are ideal. If you need to, compromise by using whatever you have available.


Use a plastic shopping bag. Be sure to wrap the limb entirely and tie the handles of the bag tightly together. If you have tape or string, use it to ensure the seal.
Use a tarp. While a tarp is waterproof, creating a reliable seal will be a challenge. Don't wrap the limb with too many layers of tarp, or you will not be able to cool the limb. Use tape and rope or whatever is available to tie the tarp snugly around the limb with as best a seal as you can create.
Use plastic wrap. An initial layer of plastic wrap around the gauze or cloth is great, but another method of creating a water seal should be used if possible.
Remember not to wrap the limb too tightly, as this may damage the tissue.
Label the limb with the patient’s name and the time it was removed from the injured person's body. Skip this step if it costs significant time to do so.

, Ideally, place the container in an iced saline bath. Use a cooler or a refrigerator if possible. Do not let the limb make direct contact with ice. If you were able to cleanly protect and wrap the limb in gauze or cloth and a watertight material, the limb will be adequately protected and can be placed in the bath safely.


If the wrap is not watertight, do not submerge the limb in an ice bath or cold water. Instead, place the limb on ice in a cooler or other vessel, making sure that some sort of material insulates the limb from direct contact with the ice.Never use dry ice.
Cold water can be used in lieu of an ice bath, but cleanliness is extremely important. Do not use water from a natural source for a cold bath unless you are sure you have a watertight seal around the limb.
If a cold source is unavailable, keep the part away from any source of heat. This includes keeping it out of direct sunlight and out of places that might get hit, such as the trunk of a car on a hot day.

, If the injured person is stable, and reattachment is viable, get the limb to the hospital (ideally traveling with the patient), as quickly as possible.


In ideal conditions, digits can be reattached up to eight hours after detachment, while limbs will only maintain suitability for reattachment for four to six hours max."

Apply petroleum jelly to the inside of your nose.,
Use a saline or water-based nasal gel.,
Wear a head guard during sports.,
Know when to visit the doctor.",How to Prevent Nose Bleeds2," If the inside of your nose if dry and irritated you have a heightened risk of nosebleeds. You can help to negate this risk by carefully applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the inside of your nose. This will keep your nasal passage moist and reduce the chance of dryness and irritation.You can re-apply the jelly two, three of four times a day., An alternative to petroleum jelly is a nasal gel that is especially designed to keep the inside of your nose moist. You can buy these gels over-the-counter from your local pharmacy or drug store. Be sure to apply the gel carefully, and according to the instructions on the packaging.You can also try nasal saline sprays to keep the nasal passages moist.

, If you are participating in sports that are likely to result in your head being knocked around, such as rugby, football, or martial arts, you should consider wearing a head guard. A head guard can help protect your head and reduce the impact of bangs to the head, which may in turn lower your chances of suffering a nosebleed., If you experience nosebleeds frequently, and you are not able to prevent them you should make an appointment to see your doctor. If a child under the age of two has a nosebleed, call your doctor. You should also speak to a doctor if you are taking blood-thinning medication, have a clotting disorder, or have high blood pressure, and if your nosebleeds are coupled with symptoms of anaemia, such as heart palpitations or a rapid heart rate, dizziness, a pale complexion, and shortness of breath. Seek immediate medical help if:


The bleeding continues for more than twenty minutes.
You have lost a lot of blood and the bleeding is heavy.
You are having trouble breathing.
You have swallowed a lot of blood, which is making you vomit.
The nosebleed developed after a serious injury."
"
Humidify your home.,
Lower the heat where you sleep.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Prevent Nose Bleeds3," Low humidity can be a common cause of nosebleeds, so if your house has a low level of humidity and you suffer frequent nosebleeds, increase the humidity at home. You can increase humidity levels across your entire house, but is especially important to make this change to your bedroom.Dry air can be a major contributor to nosebleeds, which can be countered with a humidifier.If you find that your nose has become very dry, breathe in some moist air. You could do this by turning on the shower and staying in the bathroom with the steam from the shower for 15-20 minutes at a time.You could also consider using a cold mist vaporizer in your bedroom., You can help to limit your chances of having frequent nosebleeds by turning down the heating in your bedroom. A lower temperature and cooler air will reduce the risk of drying out your nasal passages. Try to keep the temperature between around 60°F (16°C) to 70°F (21°C) where you sleep at night. However, using the air conditioner too much will lower humidity, and cause nosebleeds.


Elevating your head when you sleep, by using an extra pillow, may also help you avoid nosebleeds., When your nasal membranes dry out, they will be more susceptible to cracking and bleeding. Keeping your home humidified is one when to prevent this, but you should also be sure that you keep your body well hydrated by drinking plenty of water. If you suffer from serious and recurring nosebleeds, drink at least the recommended eight glasses a day. In particularly dry air, try to have a little water every fifteen minutes."

It could feel like pressure is being put on your chest, that it is being squeezed, or that it feels particularly full. It might go away only to come back shortly thereafter.While we imagine that a heart attack comes on as an instant, intense pain, often it is a duller pain that slowly grows into a feeling of discomfort more than pain.
Sometimes you might feel very little at all. This is particularly common for people who suffer from diabetes but can occur in other patients as well.;
, A heart attack will often be accompanied by a numbness, aching, or tingling in your arm. This occurs most commonly in the left arm, but it can appear in the right arm as well., Being unable to breath well is also a very common symptom of a heart attack. Sometimes heart attack victims will even experience shortness of breath without numbness or chest discomfort., Heart attacks are major events that disrupt a number of biological processes. That means that there is an array of symptoms, some of which are shared with more common ailments. Don’t assume that because you feel like you have a case of the flu, something worse isn’t happening to your body. Other symptoms include:


Cold sweatsNausea
Unusually pale complexionVomiting
Lightheadedness
Anxiety
Indigestion
Dizziness
Fainting
Pain in your back, shoulder, arms, neck, or jaw
Feelings of dreadSudden fatigue (especially in women and older men), It can be difficult to distinguish between heartburn and a heart attack. If the pain persists for at least three minutes or is accompanied by some of the other side effects listed, assume that you are having a heart attack. It is better to be safe and take action., People often do not want to worry their loved ones, but it is imperative that they know what is going on if you suspect that you are having a heart attack. The situation could worsen to the point that you are unable to respond effectively. Inform them at the first signs of a heart attack so they can begin caring for you.


If you are not around friends or family, try to inform anyone else who is around of your condition. It is important that someone knows what is happening to you.

, Aspirin is a blood thinner and can help in case of a heart attack. You should chew it, instead of swallowing it, because chewing it will cause it to reach your bloodstream more rapidly. Do not substitute the Aspirin for another painkiller.A standard dose of approximately 325 mg should be sufficient.
Evidence suggests that coated, enteric aspirin, which allows for slow absorption of the drug, is still beneficial to those suffering from a heart attack. There is reason to suspect, however, that un-coated aspirin are probably more effective.Do not take aspirin if you are allergic to it, have stomach ulcers, recent bleeding or surgery, or another reason for which your doctor has told you not to take aspirin.
Other painkillers like Ibuprofen, opioids, and Acetaminophen do not share the same properties and should not be administered in case of a heart attack., To increase your chances of survival, call 911 within 5 minutes of when you first develop symptoms. Three minutes of even light chest pain is a good indication that what you are experiencing is, in fact, a heart attack and that you should seek emergency medical attention.If you are also experiencing shortness of breath, numbness, or severe pain, call immediately. The sooner you call the better., If you are behind the wheel, get off the road. You could lose consciousness and endanger the lives of others. If there are other people around you, do not ask them to drive you to the hospital. It is best to be taken by the EMTs.


Response teams can get you to the hospital more rapidly than your family. They also have equipment in the ambulance that will allow them to treat you before you make it to the hospital.
The only instance when you should drive to the hospital is when you are unable to reach emergency support through 911., If you have been prescribed nitroglycerin, take it when you feel symptoms of a heart attack. It will open up blood vessels and reduce chest pain., Anxiety will increase the amount of oxygen that your heart demands. This will make it more likely that you will experience severe complications. Lie down and try to rest.


Take full, deep breaths to improve oxygen flow and calm yourself down. Do not take short, quick breaths or hyperventilate. Breathe in slowly and comfortably.
Remind yourself that help is on the way.Repeat soothing phrases like “Help is on the way,” or, “Everything will be alright” in your head.
Loosen tight or restrictive clothing., CPR is imperative if you lose your pulse. Ask around for someone who is willing to perform CPR. If no one knows it, find someone who is willing to be coached on by the 911 operator.


If the person giving you CPR does not know proper form, it is generally best that they refrain from giving mouth to mouth. They should stick to chest compressions, pushing down on your chest at a rate of about 100 compressions per minute.There is no evidence that self administered CPR during a heart attack is effective. By the point that CPR is imperative, you will already be unconscious., Exercise is a great way to increase lower bad cholesterol and improve heart health. Focus on cardiovascular exercise, like running, biking, and circuits.


You should aim for 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise 5 times days a week.
Alternatively, you can do 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise 3 days a week with two additional days of strength training., Olive oil, nuts, and fish are sources of good cholesterol that will help protect your heart. Alternatively, avoid foods that are high in saturated and trans fats. Processed foods are a major source of trans fats., Smoking tobacco strains your heart and puts you at greater risk of heart attack. If you have heart problems, you should aim to quit smoking altogether., There are now a variety of medications that can help to manage bad cholesterol and protect your heart. Have your cholesterol checked regularly and, if you are at risk, ask about medications that can help protect you.


There are several class of drugs that help with heart health. These include Niacin, Fibrates, and Statins., If you have experienced a heart attack, your doctor will typically recommend that you take a daily dose of aspirin. Your doctor might recommend a dose of anywhere from 81 mg to 325 mg, though lower doses can be effective. It is important to follow your doctor's suggestions precisely.


If you sudden stop your aspirin treatment, it is possible that you will experience a rebound effect that will significantly worsen your condition. Do not suddenly stop treatment without being told to do so by your doctor."

Inquire about medicines.",How to Respond to a Stroke," There are two types of strokes. The most common, which comprise over 90% of strokes, are ischemic strokes. These are due to a lack of blood flow to the brain, most commonly caused when plaque in the carotid arteries break off and flow downstream. It moves along until it obstructs a blood vessel and blood flow to parts of the brain. Depending on what the affected part of the brain is responsible for, such as speech, walking, or moving one half of the body, that will give the specific constellation of symptoms experienced when having a stroke.


The other, much less common, type of stroke is from a bleeding in the brain, a hemorrhagic stroke. This results from a blood vessel or collection of vessels called an aneurysm, which cause a stroke when they grow in size and about to burst. These strokes, though rare, cause the worst headache you have every experienced.
It is important to differentiate because the vast majority of stroke victims you may encounter are in no pain. This lack of pain can cause delay in recognition and treatment which in turn can cause devastating, long-term neurologic damage or death.;
, It is important to recognize the symptoms of a stroke early to insure a positive outcome. The medical profession uses the acronym FAST to remember what to look for in a stroke and how quickly to respond. F stands for face, which means you need to look for facial drooping. Notice if one side of the face is drooped or hanging. Ask the victim to smile. The affected side will not be able to turn up like the other.


You can also ask them to raise their eyebrows and the affected side will not respond., The A in FAST stands for arms, which means you need to check for arm weakness. Ask the person to raise his arms out in front of him, bringing to them to shoulder level. Push gently down on his arms and ask him to push back against the resistance. He might be able to move his arms even if he is having a stroke, but the affected arm should fall down when you push against is due to weakness.


If he can't raise his other arm, or if his arm is dropping below where he is trying to keep it, he is suffering from arm weakness., The S stands for speech, which means you need to listen for slurred speech. Notice if he is having trouble speaking, if his words are slurred, or if he is having trouble getting his words out. Ask him to repeat a word or say his name. If it is slurred, this is called dysarthria and he is likely having a stroke.If he can say his name but you are still worried, have him try to repeat a simple sentence, such as ""Roses are red."" See if he can repeat it and listen for slurring., The T stands for time, which means you need to respond in a timely manner when the symptoms appear. Time is of the essence with a stroke because the longer you wait, the more damage is done to his vital organs. Respond as quickly as possible to make sure he gets treated quickly enough to lower the chances of damage., Although FAST is a great way to check for a stroke, there are a few other symptoms you can look for when assessing the patient. The victim may be confused or have trouble understanding you. He may also have trouble seeing in one or both eyes, may have trouble walking, be dizzy, or have loss of balance or coordination., A TIA, or a ""mini stroke,"" only differs from a stroke in that the clot is ""transient"" — the blockage will pass and there is usually no permanent damage.TIA symptoms occur rapidly and last about a minute. If you experience a TIA, you should consider this a very serious warning sign about your risk for a permanent stroke. Roughly 1/3 of people who experience TIA have a stroke within a year.The signs of TIA are the same as a permanent stroke, but they pass in less than five minutes.Never wait to see if the signs of a stroke will pass. Even if it might be TIA, you should call 911 as soon as you notice any indication of a stroke.If you do experience TIA, talk to your doctor to figure out what changes you need to make to ensure you don't experience a permanent stroke down the road.

, As soon as you determine the person is having a stroke (or if you even think the person is having a stroke), you need to call 911 immediately. Let them know that you have a stroke victim, which will allow them to get the necessary equipment and know what to expect when they arrive. Do not hesitate for fear of overreacting or being incorrect. Every minute the brain goes without oxygen increases the chances that the neurological deficit will be permanent.


If the area of the stroke is expanding or affects areas of the brain that control breathing, the stroke could be lethal if you wait too long.
The goal is for the patient to receive tPA , which is the life-saving clot busting medication, within 60 minutes or less from the time the patient is picked up until the medication is delivered. This leaves no time for hesitation. Stroke victims who were able to receive tPA within 60 minutes or less had the highest percentage of being discharged home as opposed to a long term care facility due to severe neurological damage or death while in the hospital., While you are on the phone with 911, you need to ask the patient when he first started having symptoms. You need to gather information about when the symptoms started. Relate this information to 911 dispatcher. The dispatcher will likely stay on the line with you while you gather information about symptoms and time frames.


Also ask him if he has a severe headache and let the responder know. This is a symptom of a different kind of stroke.

, You need to ask the victim a series of questions about his medical history. Ask him if he has had a stroke in the past. Also ask if he has had heart problems in the past, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, or artery disease. Check to see if he has diabetes, bleeding disorders, any recent surgeries, or liver disease.


Do this as well as you can if they are suffering from slurred speech. You just need to collect as much information for emergency services as possible., While you wait for emergency services to arrive, you need to make sure you know what medications the victim in on. Ask the victim if he takes aspirin, anticoagulants, and anti-platelet agents. Also check to see if he takes insulin, anti-hypertensives, or any other prescription medication for chronic conditions.


You can also ask if he takes any illegal street drugs and how much alcohol he consumes.
If you can, try to grab medicine bottles from his possession. These will give the providers and treating physicians important information about any contraindication between medications that might arise when giving clot busting medication.
Keep him talking and focused on you until the paramedics arrive."

Rest your ankle.,
Ice your ankle to prevent swelling and pain.,
Compress your ankle joint.,
Elevate your ankle above the level of your heart.",How to Treat a Sprained Ankle1," Skip any activities that cause pain or limping.


If you have a severe sprain, then you should walk with crutches or a cane so that you don't cause further injury.
Vary your exercise routine. If you're used to running on a treadmill, try swimming or using a rowing machine instead. Just make sure that you don't completely avoid physical activity. You still need to keep your other muscles conditioned.;
,


Apply ice to your ankle even if you plan to go to the doctor. Ice will keep your ligaments from becoming inflamed and will stop any bleeding if you've torn a ligament.
Place a plastic bag with ice on your ankle for 15 to 20 minutes. Do this 3 to 5 times daily for the first 3 days. Alternatively, you can fill a bucket with ice water and immerse your foot and ankle.
Leave the ice off at least 30 minutes between applications. The latest recommendation from athletic trainers is to apply ice for the first 48 to 72 hours.
If your foot or ankle looks white, remove the ice immediately so that you don't develop a cold injury.
If you have diabetes or inhibited circulation, make sure that you talk to your doctor before applying ice.

,


Wrap an elastic bandage from your toes to your mid-calf, using even pressure. Keep the bandage on until the swelling subsides.
Loosen the wraps if your toes turn blue, feel cold or begin to feel numb. You don't want the wrap to be too loose, but you don't want it to be too tight, either.

, Elevation will help to drain fluid from the injury.

, Try some of the following exercises to help your ankle ligaments to recover:


Perform ankle circles or write the alphabet with your toes to start to increase the mobility at the ankle. If your ankle is swollen and still painful, the ligaments are still at risk of being further injured. So continue resting.
Sit in a chair with your injured foot flat on the floor. Slowly move your knee from side to side for about 2 to 3 minutes, keeping your foot flat on the floor the whole time.

, After an ankle sprain, the calf muscles often get tight. It is important to stretch these to get your normal range of motion back. If you don't, it could lead to further injuries.


Sit on the floor with your leg extended out in front of you. Wrap a towel around the ball of your foot and pull the towel toward you while keeping your knee straight. Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. If the stretch is too painful, start by holding it for just a couple of seconds and gradually increasing your time as the injury subsides. Repeat the stretch 2 to 4 times.
Stand with your hands on a wall and place your injured foot about a step behind your other foot. Keep your heel on the floor and slowly bend your knee until you feel a stretch in your calf. Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds, and repeat it 2 to 4 times.

, When you can stand without feeling increased pain or noticing increased swelling, then you can start some strengthening exercises.


Place your foot flat on the floor. Push your foot toward a wall or other immovable object, and hold the position for 6 seconds.
Sit with your feet on the floor. Wrap an exercise band or other stretchy tubing around the outsides of both of your ankles. Keep your uninjured foot on the floor, and gently push your injured ankle away from the uninjured foot, stretching the band as you go.
Sit down and place your feet together on the floor. Push your injured foot toward your uninjured foot and hold the position for about 6 seconds.
Place your uninjured foot on top of your injured foot. While pushing down with your top foot, simultaneously push the bottom foot upward. Hold for 6 seconds.

, Balance is often affected following an ankle sprain, so you'll need to concentrate on improving your balance so that you don't repeat the injury.


Purchase a wobble board or stand on a cushion. Make sure that you position yourself near a wall in case you lose your balance, or have someone else spot you while you're working on keeping steady.
If you don't have a cushion or a wobble board, then you can stand on your injured foot and lift your other foot off of the floor. Extend your arms out to your side for balance."
"
Warm up before you play sports or perform exercise.,
Use caution on uneven surfaces.,
Wear appropriate shoes.,
Try physical therapy.",How to Treat a Sprained Ankle3," If you jog, for instance, start with a leisurely walk to warm up your ankle joint before you start to pound the pavement. Wear a brace if you need to while you are exercising to stabilize your ankle joint. Also, if you're learning a new sport, be careful not to play at full intensity until you're fully conditioned for the activity.

, Because your ankle is weakened by the sprain, you could turn it again if you aren't cautious while you're walking on a rough surface.

, Some people find that high-top sneakers help to stabilize their ankles while they are exercising. No matter what your activity, wear shoes that fit well and are comfortable. Make sure that the soles aren't so slick that you risk falling, and avoid high heels for a while.

, A physical therapist can give you exercises that will strengthen your ankles and the surrounding muscles so that you are less likely to injure your ligaments again."

Your doctor will examine your leg and calf muscles, ask questions about your lifestyle and how you might have injured it, and maybe even take X-rays of your lower leg (to rule out a fracture of the tibia and fibula bones). If necessary, your doctor will refer you to a musculoskeletal specialist, who has more specialized training.


Other types of healthcare professionals who could help diagnose and treat musculoskeletal injuries include osteopaths, chiropractors, physiotherapists and massage therapists. However, you should always start with your doctor, as he can also rule out other, potentially serious causes of pain, such as blood clots, vascular injury, baker's cysts, or a potential surgical emergency like compartment syndrome.;
, Calf muscle injuries are usually just mild Grade I strains, but sometimes surgery is required if the muscles are badly torn. Furthermore, some serious medical conditions can cause calf pain or refer pain to that region, such as a bone fracture, bone cancer, bone infection (osteomyelitis), venous insufficiency, sciatica from a lumbar disc herniation or complications related to diabetes.As such, medical specialists such as an orthopedist (bone and joint specialist), neurologist (nerve specialist) or physiatrist (muscle and bone specialist) may be needed to rule out the most serious causes of your calf pain.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and ultrasound are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your lower leg pain.
Calf muscle injuries are relatively common among those who play tennis, basketball, football, soccer and volleyball, as well as those who run track and field.

, Make sure you get the doctor to clearly explain the diagnosis, especially the cause (if possible), and provide you with various treatment options for your condition. Rest and home care modalities (such as ice) are appropriate for mild-to-moderate calf muscle strains.


Research calf injuries on the internet (only medically reputable sites) in order to flesh out your understanding of the condition and learn more about treatments and their expected outcomes.
Factors that can predispose someone to a muscle strain (or ""pull"") include older age, previous muscle injury, less flexibility, lack of strength in the muscle and fatigue., Most calf strains are minor injuries and self-heal within a week -- the degree of pain, disability and bruising are good indicators of seriousness. Grade I muscle strains involve micro-tears of up to 10% of the muscle fibers.They're characterized by mild pain twinges at the back of the lower leg, usually in the mid to proximal (closer to the knee) region of the leg. Minimal loss of strength and motion is experienced. You may still be able to walk, run or play your sport, albeit with discomfort and tightness.


Muscle strains occur when the force in the muscle is so great that the tissue tears, most commonly at the junction between where the muscles taper into tendons.
Most Grade I lower leg strains cause discomfort for between two to five days post injury, but may take a few weeks to fully heal, depending on proportion of muscle fibers involved and the type of treatment sought.

, treatment protocol. The most effective treatment protocol for most sprain / strain injuries is abbreviated R.I.C.E. and stands for rest, ice, compression and elevation.The first step is rest — temporarily stop all activity in order to address your injury. Next, cold therapy (ice wrapped in a thin towel or frozen gel packs) should be applied to the injury as soon as possible in order to stop any internal bleeding and reduce inflammation, preferably while your leg is elevated on a chair or stack of pillows (which also combats inflammation). Ice should be applied for 10 –15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside over the course of a few days. Compressing the ice against your injury with a compression bandage or elastic support will also help stop the bleeding from the torn muscle fibers and associated inflammation.


Don't tie the compression bandage too tight or leave it on for more than 15 minutes at a time because complete restriction of blood flow could cause more damage to your leg.

, Your family doctor may recommend anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin, or possibly regular analgesics (pain killers) such as acetaminophen to help combat the inflammation and pain associated with your calf injury.Keep in mind these medications are hard on your stomach, liver and kidneys, so they should be taken for no more than two weeks at a time unless otherwise directed by your doctor.

, Mild muscle strains respond well to some light stretching because it relieves muscle tension and promotes blood flow. Following the inflammatory phase of a muscle strain injury, some scar tissue forms, which is not as flexible as muscle fiber. Stretching helps the scar tissue remodel and become more flexible. Thus, take a towel or compression bandage and wrap it underneath your foot nearer the toes. Then grab each end with your hands and slowly pull back while slowly extending your leg and noting the deep stretch in your calf muscles — hold for 20-30 seconds and then slowly release. Practice this stretch three to five times daily for one week, as long as your calf pain isn't exacerbated by it.

,


Warming up then stretching your calf muscles prior to any athletic activity may help prevent injuries such as strains, sprains and muscle cramps., With a more serious strain, it's important to distinguish which muscle is involved to the greater extent: the deeper soleus or the more superficial ""heads"" of the gastrocnemius. MRI or diagnostic ultrasound may be needed to best diagnose the location and degree of the injury. Grade II strains involve more extensive damage, up to 90% of the muscle fibers may be torn. These injuries present with more pain (described as sharp in nature), significant loss of muscle strength and range of motion. Swelling is more severe and bruising quickly develops because of the internal bleeding from the torn muscle fibers.


With Grade II strains, there's limited ability to perform activities, especially jumping and running, so you'll be sidelined for a while (a few weeks or more).
The gastrocnemius muscle is considered at high risk for strains because it crosses two joints (knee and ankle) and has a high proportion of type-2 fast twitch muscle fibersThe medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle is strained more often than the lateral head., treatment protocol. This protocol is still appropriate for Grade II strains, although you may have to keep the ice on your calf for a little longer (up to 20 minutes at a time) if the deeper soleus muscle is the primary site of injury. Instead of using R.I.C.E for a few days as is the case with a mild strain, more severe strains will likely require attention for a week or more.


Most Grade II lower leg strains cause significant discomfort for between one to two weeks post injury, depending on proportion of muscle fibers involved and the type of treatment sought. These types of muscle injuries may require one to two months before a complete return to athletics occurs.For moderate to severe muscle strains, the use of anti-inflammatories should be restricted in the first 24 – 72 hours due to increased risk of bleeding from the anti-platelet (blood thinning) effect., A Grade II strain is a relatively serious musculoskeletal injury that most likely involves significant scar tissue formation, as well as noticeably reduced range of motion and strength. As such, after the swelling, bruising and pain have mostly subsided, ask your doctor for a referral to a sports medicine specialist or physiotherapist who can offer a variety of tailored strengthening exercises, stretches, massage techniques and therapies such as therapeutic ultrasound (to reduce inflammation and break down scar tissue adhesions) and electronic muscle stimulation (to strengthen muscle fibers and promote blood flow).


Return to full activity is usually allowed when you're pain free, have full range of motion of your lower leg and full strength of your calf muscles, which may take a few weeks or more.Calf strains are most common in men between the ages of 30 and 50 years., A Grade III strain is a complete rupture of the muscle body or tendon. It involves significant pain (burning and/or sharp in nature), immediately severe inflammation and bruising, muscle spasms and sometimes an audible ""pop"" as the muscle is severed.There is also a palpable bulging defect in the calf as the larger severed portion strongly contracts. An inability to walk is characteristic of a Grade III calf strain, so assistance is usually needed to get to a hospital or clinic. The muscle fibers cannot reattach on their own, even with the help of scar tissue, so emergency intervention is required.


A sudden tendon rupture (such as the Achilles tendon) is often excruciating and feels like someone has shot you from behind or struck you with something sharp.
A severely strained calf will likely cause bruising, which will settle into your foot and turn it black and blue.

, Grade III (and some Grade II) strains may require surgery to repair and reattach the damaged calf muscle and/or tendon. Time is of the essence because the longer a muscle is ruptured and severely contracted, the more difficult it is to stretch out and achieve normal muscle tone. Furthermore, internal bleeding can cause local necrosis (surrounding tissue death) and possibly (though very rarely) even lead to anemia from blood loss. Ruptures within the belly of a muscle heal quicker because of the better blood supply, whereas tendon ruptures don't receive as much blood and take longer to heal. Revert to the R.I.C.E. protocol following surgery.


In the case of complete ruptures, the calf muscles take about 3 months or so to heal following surgery and rehabilitation.Post surgery, you'll likely wear a supportive compression boot and have to use crutches over the short term before progressing to physical therapy exercises.

, Much like a Grade II strain, physical therapy is needed to heal a Grade III sprain, especially if surgery is needed. Under the guidance of a physiotherapist or physiatrist, tailored isometric, isotonic, and then dynamic training exercises can be added in a consecutive manner as each type of exercise is completed without pain.These exercises will strengthen the calf muscles and return them to form. Return to athletic activity can resume slowly within 3-4 months, although there will always be a greater risk of re-injury in the future.


Poor biomechanics or foot posture contribute to calf injuries, so you may be fit with custom foot orthotics after your rehabilitation to prevent further problems.

Begin with back blows and chest thrusts if the infant is conscious while choking.",How to Provide Rescue Breathing for an Infant During First Aid," Determine if your baby is conscious and responsive. Try to get your baby's attention so that she makes eye contact with you. One of the best ways to check a baby for responsiveness is to tap or flick the bottom of her foot. The baby should flinch, kick, or move the foot as a response.If the baby doesn't respond, you'll need to immediately determine if the baby is breathing.;
, Set the baby on a firm surface. The baby should be on his back so you can easily check breathing. Open the baby's airway by gently tilting his head back with one hand. Avoid twisting the baby's neck while you do this. Use your other hand to lift the baby's chin. This will open the airway and you can see if the baby's chest is rising and falling (because of breathing). You should also get right next to the baby's mouth so you can listen and feel for breathing.Do this step quickly. You should only spend about 10 seconds figuring out whether or not the infant is breathing.If the baby is coughing or making sounds, he is breathing, but may be having trouble. The baby may need help because he is choking or having other difficulties with breathing.

, If the baby isn't responsive or is having trouble breathing, call for emergency medical help. If there are other people around you, shout for help and get someone to call 911 or a local emergency number while you stay with the baby. If you're alone, give two minutes of rescue breathing and care. Then you should call for emergency medical help.If the baby is unresponsive and not breathing, you'll need to do two minutes of modified CPR before you can call for help.

, If the baby isn't breathing, you'll need to immediately give two rescue breaths. Make sure the airway is open by tilting the head back and lifting the chin up. Cover the baby's nose and mouth with your mouth so you make a complete seal. Breathe one breath lasting one second into the baby's mouth. Pause a second and breathe into her again.


If the baby's nose and mouth are too large for you to cover with your mouth, pinch the baby's nose while covering her mouth with yours. This will create a seal.

, After giving two rescue breaths, you should see the baby's chest raise. Hopefully, the baby will begin breathing on his own. If you don't see the chest move with the rescue breaths, there is probably something lodged in the baby's airway. You'll need to respond to choking in an unconscious infant. If you successfully perform the rescue breathing (and see the chest rise), but the baby does not breathe on his own, you'll need to do CPR modified for an infant.If the baby breathes on his own, hold him in recovery position and continue to monitor the baby closely until help arrives. Cradle the baby while tilting his head downwards. This prevents choking and keeps the airway open.
If you suspect the infant has a head or neck injury, move him onto his side while keeping the head, neck, and back in a straight line., If the baby still isn't breathing after giving rescue breaths, open or remove the baby's shirt and place her on a firm surface. Place two or three fingers near the middle of the chest below the nipple line. Press straight down about 1 1/2 inches. Do 30 compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute.Try to keep the compressions smooth, not jerky. Don't worry about pressing too hard. In an emergency situation, it's more important to press hard so that the blood pumps through the body or the heart restarts.
To keep rhythm with the compressions, try saying and counting ""one and two and one and two and..."" Press down while saying the number and release while saying ""and.""

, After doing 30 chest compressions, pause and give the baby more oxygen. Tilt the baby's head back while lifting the chin up. Completely seal the baby's nose and mouth with your mouth and gently blow in for one second. Give one more rescue breath.You should see the baby's chest rise with each rescue breath.

, Do another 30 chest compressions, followed by two more breaths, and continue alternating between the compressions and rescue breaths. Do not stop doing CPR on the baby unless:The baby begins breathing on his own
A trained responder or emergency medical services take over
The surrounding area becomes unsafe
You become too exhausted to keep doing it

, If the baby recovers and begins breathing before medical help arrives, you should stop giving chest compressions and rescue breaths. You'll still want the baby to be examined by emergency help if it arrives. Or, you should immediately take your baby to the nearest doctor or hospital. This way, a doctor will ensure that the baby's airway is open and that the baby is ok. The doctor will want to watch the baby for a while to make sure she is ok.If you're unsure why the infant stopped breathing, the doctor will want to run tests to determine the cause of respiratory problems.

, If the initial rescue breaths weren't successful (you didn't see the chest rise with each breath), re-tilt the baby's head and try again. Be sure to lift the chin up and cover the baby's nose and mouth with your mouth so you make a complete seal. Breathe one breath lasting one second into the baby's mouth. Pause a second and breathe into it again.Avoid blowing forcefully into the baby. Since a baby's lungs are smaller, they only need regular breaths. Blowing forcefully could damage the baby's lungs.

, If the baby still isn't breathing after giving rescue breaths, open or remove the baby's shirt and place him on a firm surface. Place two or three fingers near the middle of the chest below the nipple line. Press straight down about 1 1/2 inches. Do 30 compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute.If you were using a clear plastic CPR barrier, you should remove while doing compressions.

, Make sure the baby's head is tilted back and look inside her mouth for an obstruction. If you see an object lodged in your baby's mouth, remove it quickly. Give two more rescue breaths.Avoid sticking your finger in the baby's mouth and sweeping it around blindly. You don't want to push the foreign object further down the baby's throat.

, If you've removed the foreign object or it's passed on its own, the baby should begin breathing on his own (following the rescue breaths). But if the baby still isn't breathing on his own, you'll need to do 30 more chest compressions. Look again for a foreign object and give two more rescue breaths.Continue the cycle of compressions, checking for an object, and rescue breaths until the infant breaths on his own or medical help arrives.

, If emergency medical help comes, let them take over. If you manage to dislodge the object blocking the baby's airway, you should still get medical attention. A doctor will want to make sure that the baby's airway is completely open.The doctor may want to run tests to make sure the infant doesn't have any internal injuries.

, Use the heel of one hand to give five back blows between the infant's shoulder blades. Turn the infant over and give five chest compressions by pushing two fingers about 1 1/2 inches into the chest just under the nipple line. Keep alternating between back blows and chest thrusts until the object comes out, the infant loses consciousness, or the infant begins coughing, breathing or crying.Be sure to support the baby's head while giving back blows and chest compressions. The head should be lower than the chest.

Some workplaces, such as laboratories, have eyewash stations or kits available for workers in case of an accident.If you work somewhere with an eyewash kit or station, make sure you know where it is so that you can find it in an emergency.
Eyewash should be at a comfortable temperature for use. It shouldn’t be too hot or too cold.
If eyewash isn’t available, clean, pure water should be used.
Flush the eye for several minutes to make sure all debris is removed.;
, If there’s a fairly large particle in the eye, lift the upper eyelid over the lashes of the lower eyelid. The person should then blink several times. The person will start to tear up and the tears should flush the eye naturally.If possible, the person with the eye injury should do this for themselves, though it’s possible they may need help, depending on the nature of the injury.

, Once the debris has been flushed out of the eye, the person should keep their eye shut as much as possible. This protects the eye from further damage. Meanwhile, get the person to a hospital or an eye doctor immediately."
"
Apply a cold compress.,
Look for blood.,
Apply heat compresses.",How to Treat an Eye Injury2," Do this as soon after the injury as possible. Hold the compress against the eye with gentle pressure. The compress should be cold, which will help reduce swelling if applied very soon after the injury.The compress can be made of a cold pack or a cloth filled with ice.
Put pressure near and around the eye, but not on the eyeball itself.
Leave the compress on until it’s no longer cold. Repeat this several times a day for a few days.

, If the colored or white part of the eye has blood in it, the person should see an eye specialist immediately. This should happen even if the person isn’t in severe pain. Blood in the eye could lead to or be a sign of serious complications. The person should also seek immediate medical care if they have:Vision problems (such as double vision or blurry vision)
Severe pain
Bruising around both eyes
Bleeding from the nose

, After the swelling has stabilized (usually after a couple of days), heat will be more effective than ice. Create a compress with a hot water bottle, a heating pad, or a washcloth soaked in hot water.A heat compress should be warm to hot; however, don’t make it so hot that it is uncomfortable or will burn you.
Keep the compress on for as long as you like. A minimum of 10 minutes is good, but you can feel free to leave it on much longer than that.
Repeat this several times a day until the injury is healed.

Seek immediate medical help.,
Avoid applying any kind of pressure.,
Do not remove the object.,
Avoid anti-inflammatory medications.,
Shield the eye until a doctor sees it.",How to Treat an Eye Injury3," A puncture or cut in the eye can be very serious. Do everything you can to get the person to a hospital or eye specialist immediately. Do not attempt to treat a cut or puncture on your own.Call 911 if necessary.
Even if the cut or puncture seems minor, seek help. It may be worse than it looks or feels.

, Pressure in this instance can make the injury worse. Try to cover the eye without putting any pressure on it or potentially pushing the object farther into it., It may be tempting and seem natural to try to remove the object from the eye, especially if the person is in a lot of pain; however, this can potentially do a lot of damage.Wait to remove the object until a medical professional can do so. They will be able to protect the eye from further damage or infection.

, The pain from an eye injury may lead the person to want to take over-the-counter pain killers; however, a lot of pain killers such as ibuprofen are anti-inflammatory, which thins blood and can increase bleeding. These can be dangerous when an eye has been punctured and should be avoided.If the person is in serious need of pain medication, ask a medical professional which medications would be safe to take.

, An eye that has been cut or punctured is particularly vulnerable to infection or to further damage. Keep the eye covered until the person is able to be seen by a doctor.Use something such as a light cloth, or even the person’s hand to keep the eye protected. Just make sure it’s clean and isn’t putting pressure on the eye.

"
"
Flush the eye immediately with water.,
Continue running water on the eye for 15 minutes.,
Seek emergency medical help.,
Keep a moist compress on the eye.",How to Treat an Eye Injury4," Use fresh, clean water to immediately dilute the chemicals and get them out of the eye as fast as possible. Ideally the person should be able to simply hold their eye under a faucet of running water for as long as necessary.There should be enough pressure to thoroughly flush the eye, but not so much as to cause painful pressure.

, This may seem excessive, but it’s important to make sure the eye is completely clean and free from chemicals. Depending on the type of chemical and how much the eye was exposed to, the eye may continue to burn or feel painful for a while., Once the immediate task of flushing the eye has been taken care of, get the person to a hospital or an eye specialist. This is important to make sure that no serious damage has been done and that flushing the eye was effective.Even if the person feels that flushing the eye was effective, it’s still advisable to seek a professional opinion, just to be safe.

, A moist compress will help keep an eye from drying out while waiting for medical care. It will also help keep it protected by covering the eye until a doctor can treat it."

Wait for the emergency services.",How to Treat a Victim of Electrical Shock," Rushing in to save someone might be your first impulse, but if the danger of electrical shock remains you will only injure yourself as well. Take a moment to assess the scene and look for any obvious dangers.Check for the source of the electrical shock. Look to see if the victim is still in contact with the source. Remember that electricity can flow through the victim and into you.
Never use water, even if there is a fire, as water can conduct electricity.
Never enter an area where electrical equipment is used if the floor is wet.
Use a fire extinguisher made for electrical fires. Fire extinguishers for use on electrical fires will be labelled as a C, BC, or ABC extinguisher.;
, It is very important that you call as quickly as possible for help. The sooner you call, the sooner help will arrive. Explain your situation as calmly and clearly as you can when you make the call.Explain that the emergency involves and electrical shock so the responders can be best prepared.
Try not to panic. Keeping as calm as you can will help you relay the proper information.
Speak clearly. Emergency services will need accurate and clear information. Speaking too quickly might lead to misunderstanding, which can waste valuable time.Provide your address and phone number accurately.
Most countries have made emergency service numbers easy to remember. Here are a few examples:

USA-911
UK – 999
Australia – 000
Canada - 911



, If you can do so safely, turn off the electrical current. Don’t attempt to rescue someone near a high-voltage line.Shutting off the current at the power box, the circuit breaker or the fuse box is the preferred option. Follow these steps to turn the power off with a circuit breaker box:


Open the circuit breaker box. Look for a rectangular block, with a handle, at the top of the fuse box.
Grab the handle and flip it to the other side, just like a light switch.
Try turning on a light or other electrical device to double check the power is off.

, Don’t touch the victim, even with a non-conducting instrument, if the electricity hasn’t been shut off. Once you’re sure there is no current, use a rubber or wooden stick, or any other non-conducting tool, to separate the victim from the source.Examples of non-conducting materials include glass, porcelain, plastic and paper. Cardboard is another common, non-conducting material that you may use.Conductors, which allow electricity to flow, include copper, aluminium, gold and silver. If the victim has been hit by lightning, he or she is safe to touch.

, Placing the victim of electrical shock in the recovery position will ensure that her airway remains clear.Follow these steps to properly put the victim in the recovery position:


Place the arm nearest to you at a right angle with her body.
Place the other hand under the side of her head. The back of the hand should touch the cheek.
Bend the farthest knee at a right angle.
Roll the victim on the side. The top arm will support the head.
Lift the chin of the victim and check the airway.
Stay with the victim and monitor her breathing. Once in recovery position, don’t move the victim, as this can cause further injury.

, The victim will quickly cool down. You should try to wrap her in a thermal blanket to keep the body temperature regulated.Wait for the emergency services with the victim.


Don’t cover the body if there are large wounds or untreated burns.
Be gentle when you place the blanket over them.
When the emergency services arrive, give them what details you have. Explain very quickly the source of the danger. Notify them of any wounds you've noticed and the time of the accident. Don't try to interfere once they take over.

, Try talking with the victim to learn more about her state. You will be able to better help by learning as much as you can. Pay careful attention to any responses and be ready to relay them to emergency services when they arrive.Identify yourself and ask the victim what happened. Ask whether the victim has trouble breathing and if she is experiencing any pain.
Ask where sources of pain are located. This may identify any wounds or burns.
If the victim is unconscious, check the airway and listen for breathing.

, Check the victim’s body, starting with the head and moving down to the neck, chest, arms, stomach and legs. Look for any burns or other injuries that are immediately noticeable. Report injuries to emergency responders when they arrive.Don't manipulate or move any painful or wounded areas and don't touch any burns. Moving the victim can cause further injury.

, If the victim is bleeding, try to stop or slow blood loss. Use a clean cloth to apply direct pressure. Continue pressing until the bleeding stops.Do not remove the cloth if soaked with blood, add more layers to it.
Elevate the bleeding limb higher than the heart. Do not move the limb if you suspect a fracture.
Once bleeding stops, wrap the cloth in a bandage to secure it in place.
Wait for emergency services to arrive and inform them of the injury and what you have done to treat it.

, If you notice any change in the victim’s condition or if you spot any new wounds, call emergency services again for further instructions. Keeping emergency services up to date will help them respond better.If the condition worsens, the operator might prioritize your situation.
If the victim stops breathing, the operator might tell you how to perform CPR. Don’t panic, follow any instructions you are given.

, In an emergency situation, it is important to assess the victim’s airways, breathing and circulatory system before performing CPR. This procedure is also known as ABC. You can assess these things by doing the following:Check the victim’s airway. Look for any obstructions or signs of damage.
Watch to see if the victim is taking spontaneous breaths. Observe the victim to see if he or she is breathing normally. To do this, put your ear close to the victim’s nose and mouth and listen for any breathing.Never perform CPR if the victim is breathing or coughing.
Start CPR if the victim is not breathing. If the patient is not breathing, then you will have to start CPR right away., Although medical professionals will assess the victim for signs of disability, you may find it helpful to identify the victim’s level of responsiveness and pass this information on to the emergency response team. Disability is often graded as one of four categories:A for alert. This means that the victim is awake, able to talk, and aware of his or her surroundings.

V for voice responsive. This means that the victim can respond to questions, but he or she may not seem too alert or aware of what is going on.

P for pain responsive. This means that the victim is showing some sort of response to the pain.

U for unresponsive. This means that the patient is unconscious and not responding to questions or reacting to pain. If the victim is unconscious, you may proceed with the application of CPR. Do not apply CPR techniques to a person who is already breathing and conscious., You, and the victim, will need to be in the proper position to perform CPR. Follow these steps to ensure you are both in the right position for compression:Put the person on her back and tilt the head back.
Kneel down next to the victims shoulders.
Place the heel of one hand over the center of the person's chest, between the nipples.
Place your other hand on top of the first hand. Keep your elbows straight and position your shoulders directly above your hands.

, After positioning yourself properly you may now begin compressions. Compressions can help keep the person alive, keeping oxygenated blood flowing to the brain. Use your upper body weight , not just your arms, as you push straight down on the chest.
Push at least 2 inches (approximately 5 centimeters).
Push hard, at a rate of about 100 compressions a minute. Continue until the victim is breathing again or emergency services arrive.

, Someone who has suffered even a mild burn from an electrical shock will require medical treatment. Do not attempt to treat the victim on your own. Call emergency services or take the victim to the nearest hospital.

, Burn wounds have certain characteristics that can help you identify them. Look for any injuries on the victim that have one or more the following qualities:Red skin.
Peeling skin.
Blisters.
Swelling.
White or charred skin.

, Electricity will usually enter the body in one place and leave in another. Inspect as much of the victim as you are able. Once you have identified injuries, cool the burns with cool water for ten minutes. Make sure that the water is clean to avoid any bacterial infection.
Don’t use ice, either cold or hot water, or any creams or greasy liquids on the burn. Burned skin is sensitive to extreme temperatures and creams may cause issues with healing.

, It’s important to remove clothes and the jewellery near the burn to avoid further damage. Some clothing or jewellery may still be hot from the electrical shock and can continue to damage the victim..Don’t try to remove melted clothes or pieces of tissue stuck in a wound.
Don’t cover the victim with a regular blanket if burned, as this may cause infection.

, Covering the burn will help protect the area from any further damage and lower the risk of infection. Try using the following materials to cover a burn:Sterilized gauze bandage
Clean cloth
Avoid towels or blankets.Do not apply adhesive bandages.

, Once the victim is stabilized, you should stay with her and try to offer reassurance. Don’t forget to keep the emergency services updated if you’ve treated a burn.


Keep your phone with you in case you need to call anyone quickly. Monitor the victim's state as best you can and do not leave them alone.

Use the RICE approach recommended by first aid professionals.,
Rest the injured joint by not using it, unless absolutely necessary.,
Ice the injured area as quickly as possible.,
Compress the sprain with a bandage or wrap.,
Elevate the sprained joint above your heart, if possible.,
Treat your injury with over-the-counter pain relievers.,
Handle your pain through homeopathic treatments.,
Avoid certain activities than can cause further problems.",How to Treat a Sprain During First Aid1," RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compress, and Elevate. Incorporate all aspects of this treatment to recover in a timely manner and reduce initial pain and swelling.;
, Rest is essential to the healing process and to avoid unnecessary pain from the injury. If you must use the joint (e.g., walking), do so with caution and extra support.


Use crutches to walk if you sprained an ankle or knee.
Wear a sling for wrist or arm sprains.
Wrap a splint around a sprained finger or toe and attach it to the digit next to it.
Don’t avoid all physical activity because of the sprain, but avoid direct use of the injured joint for at least 48 hours or until the pain subsides.
If you are involved in sports, talk to your coach, trainer or doctor about when you can return to sports.

, Using an ice pack or cold compress, apply pressure to the injury for up to 3 days until the swelling goes down.


Use any form of frozen compress such as ice cubes in a plastic bag, reusable chemical ice packs, a frozen towel, or even bags of frozen vegetables in a pinch.
Administer ice treatment within 30 minutes of your injury if possible.
Do not apply ice directly to the skin—use a towel or cloth to protect your tissues.
Reapply the ice or cold compress every 20–30 minutes throughout the day.
Remove the ice or cold compress after treatment and let your skin return to its normal temperature before the next round.
Apply the ice or cold compress long enough that you begin to feel the area ache and become slightly numb—this may be 15–20 minutes—which will help reduce pain., This will keep the injured area protected and supported.


Wrap the joint tightly but not so tight that your limb becomes numb or tingly.
Use a brace for ankles, which may be more effective than a bandage or wrap.
Look for elastic bandages or wraps to provide the best support and flexibility.
Find supportive athletic tape as an alternative to bandages if necessary.
Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure what type of wrap to use or how to use it.

, Elevation helps minimize or prevent swelling. Try to keep the injured body part elevated for 2 to 3 hours each day.


Sit or lie down with the injured knee or ankle propped up on a cushion.
Use a sling for wrist or arm sprains to bring the limb above the heart.
Sleep with your injured arm or leg propped on 1-2 pillows if you are able to.
Raise the injured part to the same level as your heart if more elevation is impossible.
Beware of any feelings of numbness or tingling and reposition your injured joint if you do; consult a doctor if this continues.

, These can help with pain and inflammation caused by your sprain. However, avoid aspirin, as this promotes bleeding and can therefore cause complications and extreme discoloration of the skin. Look for NSAIDS including ibuprofen (e.g., Advil) or Aleve, which are usually recommended for sprains due to their anti-inflammatory properties. You can also take acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) products for pain.Consult a doctor or pharmacist for dosage and the most effective product for you.
Ask a doctor or pharmacist about taking these pain relievers if you already take other prescription medications.
Follow the product label for dosage and frequency.
Be aware of the potential side effects of over-the-counter pain relievers. >.Use pain relievers together with all aspects of the RICE therapy.

, Although these therapies are not scientifically proven to help ease pain, many people find them helpful.


The spice called turmeric is known for its anti-inflammatory properties—mix 2 tablespoons with 1 tablespoon of lime juice and some water into a paste and apply it to the injured joint, then wrap with a bandage for several hours.
Find epsom salts at your pharmacy—mix a cup of salts with warm water in a tub or bucket, let them dissolve, and soak the injured joint for 30 minutes up to several times of day.
Spread the herbal arnica salve or cream (available at pharmacies) on the injured joint to reduce inflammation and swelling as well as increase circulation; wrap with a bandage after application.

, For the first 72 hours after your injury, it’s essential to be especially cautious. Keep out of hot water—no hot baths, hot tubs, saunas, or hot compresses.
Abstain from drinking alcohol, as it increases swelling and bleeding and slows healing.
Take a break from strenuous exercise like running, cycling, and other similar sports.
Save the massages until the healing phase, as it can promote swelling and bleeding.

Visit a doctor if the injury does not improve within 72 hours or if you experience symptoms of a broken bone.,
Make note of the symptoms of broken bones.,
Observe the injury for signs of infection.",How to Treat a Sprain During First Aid2," Anything beyond a simple sprain should be evaluated by medical professionals.


Call for medical assistance if you cannot put any weight on the injured limb, as it may be a sign of an especially bad sprain or a broken bone.
Avoid trying to tough it out—it’s not worth the risk if the injury is worse than you think.
Don’t attempt to diagnose your injury yourself.
Seek medical advice to avoid prolonged suffering and/or more injuries and pain resulting from the original sprain.

, Several characteristics are possible symptoms of a break and the injured party and/or their caretaker should consider them. If you have any of these symptoms, you should seek medical attention.


Notice any inability to move the injured joint or limb.Be aware of numbness, tingling, or extreme swelling in the injured joint.
Look for open wounds associated with the injury.
Recall whether you heard a popping sound when you were injured.
Observe the joint or limb for deformity.
Note any tenderness to a specific bone in the joint (point tenderness) or significant bruising to the area.

, Any hint of infection needs to be treated immediately to keep it from spreading and making you ill.


Look for open cuts or skin abrasions around the injury that could introduce infection.
Beware of having a fever within the first hours to first few days of your injury.
Examine the injured joint or limb for signs of redness or red streaks branching out from the injured spot.
Feel the injured area for warmth or an increase in swelling, a typical sign of infection."
"
Treat anyone with a head injury as if they have a spinal injury.,
Do NOT move the victim.,
Call for emergency services.,
Give CPR if necessary.,
Note the cause of the injury.,
Recognize symptoms of spinal injury.,
Stabilize the victim until help arrives.",How to Treat a Spinal Injury Victim1," The best rule about assessing whether a victim has a spinal injury is to assume that they do. This is because the consequences of spinal injury are severe and usually permanent, and mistreating someone with a spinal injury – even if you have the best intentions – can seriously worsen the injury and outcome. Any victim with an injury to their head, neck or back should automatically be treated as if they have a spinal injury.Recognize that head wounds can come from many types of injuries, and you will not always see blood or an open wound when someone has hit their head. Diving into shallow water, for instance, may be an unsuspected source of spinal injury.;
, Any movement of the injured person can cause worse damage to their spinal cord. The only time you should ever move a potential spinal injury victim is if they are in immediate danger, such as in a burning house or car.If you are both in a safe environment, leave them exactly where they are and allow medical professionals to move them.


If the victim was wearing a helmet at the time of injury, such as during sports or in a motorcycle accident, do not remove the helmet. This should be done by professionals., Medical professionals will be better able to assess and manage potential spinal injuries, and will have backboards and special equipment for moving people with these injuries. Contacting emergency medical personnel should be done immediately, assuming you and the victim are in no immediate danger.


When calling for medical aid, inform staff that you are dealing with a victim of a spinal injury. They will be able to give you more advice on how to take care of the victim.

, Observe whether the victim is breathing on their own, as spinal injury can sometimes affect ability to breathe spontaneously. Look to see if their chest is rising with breath, or feel under their nose for air. The only time you should move the victim’s head – short of being in immediate peril – is if you have to provide the rescue breathing or chest compressions of CPR. This can be a life-saving measure until emergency medical care arrives.


If the victim’s heart is beating but they are not breathing, provide rescue breaths; if they have no pulse, focus on high-quality chest compressions.
To give rescue breaths, do NOT lift the victim’s chin to open an airway if you can avoid it. Instead perform what is called the Jaw Thrust maneuver: Kneel at the top of the victim’s head, use both hands one on each side to hold the angles of their lower jaw, and lift upward with both hands.This technique may be slightly safer for spinal injury victims. Unfortunately, this requires a second person present to perform the rescue breathing while you hold the jaw upward.
If they do not need CPR, you can then – without moving the victim – look them over to see if they have any other obvious severe injuries. Apply pressure to wounds that are heavily bleeding., The most common cause of spinal injury in persons under age 65 is vehicular accidents. Other common causes are falls, gunshot and knife wounds, playing sports without appropriate safety equipment (especially American football), and injury sustained while under the influence of alcohol.Be on high alert for potential spinal damage with any of these injuries, and treat the victim accordingly. It may also help medical staff if you can tell them what caused the injury.

, If no healthcare professional is on site, you can evaluate the victim for signs and symptoms of spinal injury. First observe the victim – if they are unconscious or only somewhat conscious, their neck or back is at a strange angle, or they have lost control of their bladder or bowels and soiled themselves, assume spinal injury. Also treat them as if they have spinal injury if they won’t or can’t move their neck, seem to have trouble breathing, or they tell you they have intense pain in their neck, back or head. Another tell-tale sign of spinal injury is change in strength or sensation in their limbs.Spinal injury can cause weakness in any part of the body, as well as paralysis – the inability to move at all, or move part of the body. Depending on the location of the injury, the patient will be affected in all four limbs, only on one side of the body, or in some or only one limb.Limbs can experience a number of sensation including numbness, tingling, pain, or a strong stinging.Loss of sensation can involve inability to distinguish temperature or feel touch.

, Keep the victim totally still until professional help arrives. Hold their head and neck to prevent them from moving until emergency care arrives.Attempt to calm the victim by assuring them that help is on the way, and encourage them in a calming voice to stay completely still.


Tell them gently but firmly, “You may be badly injured. I’m here and professional help is on the way, but I need you to stay nice and still right now.”

"
"
Pull the victim by their clothing.,
Pull the victim by their arms or legs.,
Keep their neck and torso straight and pull them in a straight line.,
Use at least two people if you must roll the victim over.",How to Treat a Spinal Injury Victim2," In a situation that absolutely requires you to move the victim, do it in the least damaging way possible. Grab their shirt collar and use your forearms to support their head while pulling the body in a straight line. This is a preferred method as the victim's head is braced while moving.

, Alternately, hold the victim and pull them by both feet, both shoulders, or both arms pulled over their shoulders. Do NOT pull by one arm or leg, as this will twist the body.

, Do not pull the body sideways! Emergency medical staff immobilize the spine with a rigid neck collar and a carrying board.If you must move the body, simulate this type of support by pulling the body only straight. The goal is to minimize movement in the neck and spine as much as possible.


If injury occurs in the water, keep the victim afloat until someone can obtain a rigid board to slide under their head and torso as far down as their buttocks. If you can’t get a board, get help from other people to get the victim out of the water by moving them as one unit. Support their head and body, as if on a stiff board, and don’t let their neck bend or rotate., If you must roll a spinal injury victim over to prevent choking on blood or vomit, get a second person to help you. Coordinate your timing so that you roll the victim over in such a way that the neck, back, and torso move as one unit. Do not allow the body to twist."
"
Monitor injured victims for late signs of spinal injury.,
Obtain diagnostic imaging.,
Participate in ongoing rehabilitation.",How to Treat a Spinal Injury Victim3," Though many victims of head or neck trauma experience immediate symptoms of spinal injury, this is not always the case. Sometimes there are no immediate signs but as bleeding and swelling put pressure on the spinal cord, symptoms develop.Victims of potential injury should be monitored closely. It’s best to go to the hospital right after injury, but if not then seek immediate medical care if the injured person develops late symptoms of:


Changes in sensory perception, like numbness and paralysis, which may worsen gradually.Gradual inability to control bladder or bowel, such as “leaking” urine or becoming incontinent.
New onset of erectile dysfunction or changes in genital sensitivity.Increased or new difficulty with walking, balance or coordination., If you or a loved one are at risk of spinal injury after an accident, go to the emergency room or at least see your doctor for testing. Your family doctor can perform sensorineural testing, manually testing muscle strength and ability to feel light touch. More definitive tests are CT scans, X-rays, and MRIs., The injury victim of spinal trauma will initially be stabilized in the hospital. After the hospital stay, however, long-term rehabilitation will begin. The rehabilitation team can involve physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, nutritionists, and social workers.This can be a physically and emotionally challenging time for the victim.


Provide emotional support and help however you can, whether that’s making frequent visits to play cards, walk the victim’s dog, preparing meals, or just being available to talk about their struggles.

"
Secure your environment.,
Call for help.,
Assess the hand burn.",How to Treat a Hand Burn1," As soon as a burn occurs, stop what you are doing. Make the scene safe by shutting off any open flame or burner so no one else gets hurt. If there is a fire that is out of control, get out of the area as soon as possible and call emergency services.


If it is a chemical burn, stop and clear the area for safety. Remove the chemical from your skin if possible. Use a dry brush for dry chemicals, or rinse the burn under cool water.If it is an electrical burn, turn off the source of the electricity and move away from any wires.;
, If the fire is out of control in your home, call 911 to get the fire department to your area. Call poison control if you are unsure whether the chemical could cause other side effects. For an electrical burn, call 911 if the wire is still live, or if the burn was caused by a high-voltage wire or a lightning strike.If you are unsure if the wire is still live, do not touch it directly. Touch it with a dry, nonconducting source like a dry piece of wood or plastic.People who have suffered electrical burns should always seek medical attention, as the electricity can interfere with your body's natural electrical impulses and cause severe side effects., Look at the burned area of the hand to assess the damage. Note the placement of the burn on the hand. Look at the appearance of the burn and note specific characteristics. This will help you decide which type of burn you have. Burns are classified as first-, second-, or third-degree, depending on how deeply they have burned the skin. First-degree burns are the mildest type, while third-degree burns are the worst. Different methods are used to treat burns depending on their degree.If the hand burn is on the palm, you should seek prompt medical attention. Burns on the palm could cause long-term disability.If you have circumferential burns on your fingers (meaning the burns wrap around any or several fingers), seek prompt medical attention. This type of burn can restrict blood flow and in severe cases could require amputation of the finger if left untreated."
"
Recognize a first-degree burn.,
Treat first-degree burns.,
Remove jewelry.,
Apply aloe or burn ointment.,
Take pain medication if needed.,
Monitor the burn.",How to Treat a Hand Burn2," First-degree burns only affect the top layer of skin, the epidermis. First-degree burns are a little bit swollen and red. They also are painful. When you press on the skin, they might turn white for a few moments after you release the pressure. If the burn has not blistered or opened but has just reddened the skin, you have a first-degree burn.If a mild burn covers the hand as well as the face or airway, most of the hands, feet, groin, buttocks, or over major joints, a trip to the doctor is recommended.
Sunburns are common first degree burns, unless there is blistering involved., If you determine that the burn is first-degree based on the way it looks and feels, quickly but calmly get to a sink. Put your hand or arm under the faucet and run cool water over it for 15-20 minutes. This will help pull heat away from the skin, which will help reduce inflammation.You can also take a bowl of cold water and place the affected area in it for a few minutes. This will also help pull heat away from the skin, reduce inflammation, and prevent as much scarring.
Do not use ice because it can lead to frostbite on the burned skin if it is left on the skin for too long. Also, if the skin around the burn has ice on it, it too can be damaged.You should also not apply butter or blow air on the burn. This will not help and can increase your likelihood of infection., Burns can cause swelling, which could cause jewelry on the burned hand to become uncomfortably tight, cut off proper circulation, or dig into the skin. Remove any jewelry on the burned hand, such as rings or bracelets., If you have an aloe vera plant, break off one of the lower leaves near the center of the stalk. Slice off the spines, split the leaf lengthwise, and apply the gel directly to the burn. It will immediately provide a cooling relief. This is a good relief for a first-degree burn.If you don't have an aloe vera plant, you can use store bought 100% aloe vera gel.
Do not apply aloe to an open wound.

, Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), naproxen (Aleve), or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are all considered safe for short-term use., Burns can become worse over the course of a few hours. After rinsing and treating your burn, monitor your burn to make sure that it does not develop into a second-degree burn. If it does, consider seeking medical treatment."

Recognize second-degree burns.,
Remove jewelry.,
Rinse the burn.,
Apply an antibiotic cream.,
Clean a popped blister.,
Apply a new bandage daily.,
Make a homemade honey ointment.,
Monitor the burn.",How to Treat a Hand Burn3," Second-degree burns are more severe than first-degree burns because they extend past the epidermis and into the lower layer of skin (the dermis).This doesn't necessarily mean they need medical care. The burns will be a dark red and will produce blisters on the skin. They are more swollen and splotchy than first-degree, with more reddened skin, which may look wet or shiny. The burned area itself may look white or discolored.If the burn is larger than 3 inches, treat as third-degree and seek medical attention immediately.Common causes of second-degree burns including scalding, flame, contact with a very hot object, bad sunburn, chemical burns, and electrical burns., Burns can cause swelling, which could cause jewelry on the burned hand to become uncomfortably tight, cut off proper circulation, or dig into the skin. Remove any jewelry on the burned hand, such as rings or bracelets., Treatment for second-degree burns is almost the same as first degree burns. When the burn occurs, quickly but calmly get to a sink and put your hand or arm under the cold water for 15-20 minutes. This will help pull heat away from the skin and reduce inflammation. If blisters are present, do not pop them. They help the skin heal. Popping them can introduce infection and delay healing time.Don’t apply butter or ice to the burn. Also, do not blow on the burn because it can increase your likelihood of infection., Because second-degree burns extend further into the skin, the potential for infection is greater.Apply an antibiotic cream to the burned area before bandaging it.


Silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene) is a popular antibiotic ointment for burns. It is often available over-the-counter without a prescription.Use a lot of the cream so that it will soak into the skin for a long time., If a blister does pop on its own or by accident, do not panic. Clean it with a mild soap and clean water. Apply an antibiotic ointment and cover the burn with a new bandage.

, Burn dressings should be changed daily to help prevent infection. Remove the old bandage and throw it away. Rinse the burn in cool water, avoiding soap. Do not scrub the skin. Let the water run on it for a few minutes. Pat dry with a clean towel. Apply burn cream, antibiotic ointment, or aloe vera to the burn to help it heal. Cover with a new sterile bandage.


When the wound is gone or mostly gone you won't need the bandage anymore.

, The use of honey to treat burns is supported by several studies, although doctors consider it an alternative treatment. Take a teaspoon of honey to cover the burn. Dab it on your wound. Honey is naturally antiseptic and keeps bacteria out of the wound, but causes no damage the outside healthy skin. The honey's low PH and high osmolarity helps the healing. Medicinal honey is recommended instead of the kind you bake with.Studies have suggested that honey may be a better alternative than regular silver sulfadiazine prescription ointment.Dressing changes should happen daily. If the wound drains more often, change the dressing more often.
If the burn cannot be covered, then reapply the honey every 6 hours. It helps cool the burn as well., Burns can become worse over the course of a few hours. After rinsing and treating your burn, monitor your burn to make sure that it does not develop into a third-degree burn. If it does, seek medical treatment immediately.While healing, look for signs and symptoms of infection, such as pus-like oozing from the burn, fevers, swelling, or increased redness on the skin. If these signs occur, seek medical treatment.

Recognize major burns.,
Recognize third-degree burns.,
Respond to the situation.,
Take care of the burn victim.,
Cover the burn.,
Get treatment at the hospital.",How to Treat a Hand Burn4," Any burn can be a major burn if it is over the joints or covering the majority of the body. It is also major if the burned person is having complications with vital signs or difficulty with normal activities because of the burn. These should be treated the same as third-degree burns, with immediate medical attention., If your burn is bleeding or looks a little bit black, you may have a third-degree burn. Third-degree burns burn through all layers of skin: the epidermis, dermis, and the underlying fat. These burns may appear white, brown, yellow, or blackened. The skin may look dry or leathery. They are not as painful as first or second because the nerves have been either damaged or destroyed.These burns require immediate medical attention. Call for emergency services or get to an emergency room.


These burns can become infected and your skin may not grow back correctly.
If your clothes are sticking to this burn, do not pull the clothes away. Get help right away.

, If you or someone near you gets a third degree burn, call 911 immediately. While waiting for EMS to arrive, check to see if the person is responsive. Responsiveness is established by gently shaking the victim. If there is no response, look for signs of movement or breathing. If they are not breathing, start CPR if you have been trained to do so.If you do not know how to perform CPR, you can ask the emergency dispatcher to talk you through it.Do not attempt to clear the airway or breathe for the other person if you do not know CPR. Instead, focus only on chest compressions.Lie the person on her back. Kneel next to her shoulders. Place your hands over the center of her chest, and move your shoulders so that they are right above your hands with your arms and elbows straight. Push straight down on her chest for about 100 compressions per minute., While you are waiting on emergency personnel to arrive, remove any constrictive clothing and jewelry. Do not do this if the clothing or jewelry is stuck in the burn. If this happens, leave it as is and wait for help to arrive. Removing it will pull off skin and cause further injury. You should also keep yourself (or the patient) warm, as these severe burns can cause you to go into shock.Do not soak the burn in water, as you would with minor burns. This can lead to hypothermia. If possible, elevate the burn above heart level to help reduce swelling.
Do not give any pain medication. You do not want to give anything that could interfere with the emergency medical treatment.
Do not pop blisters, scrape dead skin, or apply aloe or salve., If it is possible, you should try to cover the burn so it does not become infected. You need to use something that will not stick to it, such as lightweight gauze or a moistened bandage. If the bandage will stick due to the severity of the burn, wait for EMS.You might be able to use plastic wrap. If used for a very temporary amount of time, plastic wrap has been shown to be effective as a dressing. It protects while maintaining a low level of transmission of outside organisms to the burn., When you arrive at the hospital, the staff will move quickly to be sure to treat the burn effectively. They may start an IV to replace any lost electrolytes from your body. They will also clean the burn, which can be very painful. They may give you pain medication. They will apply ointments or creams to the burn, and cover it with a sterile dressing. If needed, they might create a warm, humid environment to help the burn heal.They might have a nutritionist suggest a high protein diet to aid with healing.
If necessary, the physician may talk to you about follow-up skin grafting. Skin grafting is when you take a piece of skin from another part of the body to cover the burnt area.
Expect the hospital staff to teach you how to do dressing changes at home. After discharge, dressings will need to be changed. Follow-up will continue with the physician to assure adequate healing."

Cover the wound.,
Change the dressing regularly.,
Watch for indications of infection.",How to Treat a Skin Flap or Abrasion During First Aid," Before you take action to address an abrasion or a skin flap, you need to ensure that you are lowering any potential risk of infection. The abrasion itself is unlikely to be serious, but if it becomes infected you could become very ill. Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water, before you turn your attention to the wound.If you have access sterile latex gloves you can wear these as well.;
, Once you have cleaned your hands, you can turn your attention to the abrasion. Depending on the severity of the abrasion you may have to work to stop the bleeding. Generally for a minor abrasion this won’t be a major problem, and small cuts normally stop bleeding on their own. If the wound continues to bleed, press a sterile pad or dressing against it. Apply firm and steady pressure to the wound.


Use Telfa dressings, nonstick gauze that it will not stick to the clotting surface of the wound.
If blood starts to seep through the dressing, hold down more layers against the wound.
Do not remove the dressing until you are sure that the bleeding has stopped.
If the wound is on a limb, raise it and limit and flow of blood to the wound site.
For example, if you have an abrasion on your arm, hold it up while applying pressure to the wound.If it does not stop bleeding, seek immediate medical help., When you have the bleeding under control, you need to clean the wound carefully and thoroughly to avoid any infections. Start by rinsing around the wound with cool water to remove any debris. Be careful not to aggravate the wound and re-start the bleeding.


Clean around the wound with saline if it is available. Using saline to clean the skin flap and wound area helps keep the skin supple and therefore makes it easier to reattach it to the wound border. If you do not have saline, use soap and water, but be careful not to get any soap into the wound itself.
For a minor wound you do not need to use hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or a similar cleanser. These products can irritate the injured tissue. Hydrogen peroxide should not be used on any open wound.
You can carefully remove any remaining debris in the wound with tweezers. Be sure to sterilise the tweezers first with rubbing alcohol., If you have a skin flap, you need to determine whether or not to trim this off before you dress the wound. A flap of skin appears when the skin layers have separated. There are two types of skin flap: full thickness and partial thickness. Full thickness flaps happen most often when the skin is thin and fragile, and are most common for older people.Full thickness skin flaps should not be trimmed off by you, and they should be treated by a doctor.
A partial thickness skin flap can occur on an area of thick skin, such as the palm. A partial thickness skin flap only involves losing the outer layer of your skin.
You may be able to tell if it is a partial thickness flap by looking for fingerprint lines on the underside of the flap.
If you are in any doubt, treat it as a full thickness flap and get it treated by a doctor or nurse., Before you continue and dress the wound, make yourself aware of the circumstances in which you should seek professional medical help. If you have a minor cut or abrasion, this will not normally not be necessary. There are instances when a seemingly minor abrasion will require treatment. These include:


If the skin is torn and you have skin flap.
The wound is large, deep or gaping and may require stitches.
The wound is dirty or there is something in it.
It is a puncture wound, which may have been caused by standing on a nail or an animal bite.
There are signs of infection, such as pus, a bad smell, or you are feeling unwell.
If the wound is large or dirty and you haven’t had a tetanus shot in the last five years.
You are taking medication that may affect your healing., When you are ready to dress the wound, you can begin by applying a thin layer of an antibiotic ointment or cream. This will help keep the surface moist, aiding the body’s natural healing process and limiting the risk of infection.Ensure that whoever is applying the ointment has thoroughly cleaned their hands before they start.


Some ingredients in antibiotic treatments can cause a rash to develop around the wound.
If you experience discomfort and a rash appears, stop using the ointment or cream., Now you can apply a dressing or covering over the wound. This will help you keep the wound clean and free from infection. Ensure that the dressing you apply is sterile, and take care not to irritate the wound as you apply it. Again, use Telfa dressing if you have it.


If your cut or abrasion is minor, you may not need to cover it.Use of soft, silicone-coated dressings have been found to increase the likelihood that skin flaps will reattach to the surrounding tissue with little to no necrosis (tissue death).

, You will need to change the dressing regularly to care for the wound effectively. Change the dressing at least once or day. If the dressing becomes dirty or wet, change it right away. Be careful removing and replacing the dressing, and ensure that you do not irritate the wound and impede the healing process.


Once the wound has healed enough that infection is unlikely, you can remove the dressing.
Leaving the wound uncovered, and exposing it to the air, will speed up the final part of the healing process., It’s important that you keep a close eye on the wound and watch for any signs of infection. If your wound is not healing properly you should contact your doctor. If you observe any of the following indicators of infection, you should see your doctor as soon as possible.


Redness, swelling and warmth around the wound.
You have developed a fever or are feeling generally unwell.
There is pus or discharge from the wound.
There are red streaks on your skin around the wound.
You are experiencing increasing amounts of pain from the wound."

You can call your local 9-1-1 center to see if you can text 9-1-1 in your area. You can find the number for your local 9-1-1 center in the yellow pagers or online.If it's an emergency and you don't have time to check, simply try texting to 9-1-1. You will receive a bounce back text, which is mentioned later, if the technology is not yet available in your area.;
, To start, you'll have to compose your message. Keep your message brief and to the point to avoid going over the standard text message limit, which is usually 160 characters of text. You should also avoid using slang, as this puts you at risk of having your text misunderstood.


Include which service you need, where you need that service, and why you need that service. For example, ""Need ambulance at the corner of Sunset and Western due to car accident.""If you do not know your precise location, list roads, landmarks, and other clues that could help emergency services find you. For example, something like, ""By a theater called Hilton's, somewhere on west side of town.""Try to include all the information right away. A dispatcher will want to get services to you as quickly as possible, so do not withhold necessary information like an address, if you have one., Even in an area where a text can go through, texts to 9-1-1 have certain limitations. Understand these limitations before attempting to text 9-1-1.


You cannot send photos, videos, or other media to 9-1-1 via text. All you can include are letters or numbers.You have to be in range of your cell phone's tower to text 9-1-1 in some situations. Texts to 9-1-1 may not go through if you're roaming., Once you've composed your message, you can send it to 9-1-1. To do so, simply type in ""9-1-1"" in the address line. Then, hit ""send."" You send a text to 9-1-1 as you would send any other text on your phone. You simply have ""9-1-1"" listed as the recipient of the text., If your area is able to respond to texts to 9-1-1, you should get a response from a dispatcher. If you included all necessary information, he or she will alert you emergency services are on the way. If further information is needed, the dispatcher will request it via text. Text back as soon as you receive a response., The FCC requires that all wireless carries and other text message providers send out what are called ""bounce back texts"" if your area is not equipped to respond to 9-1-1 texts. This is to prevent customers from mistakenly thinking emergency services area on the way if a text fails to go through. A bounce back text will come seconds after you text 9-1-1. It will inform you to call emergency services through other means., In the event you receive a bounce back text, calling is always the best option. This is the quickest and easiest way to get in touch with a 9-1-1 dispatcher and receive necessary emergency services. However, if you're texting 9-1-1, you may be unable to call for a variety of reasons. In this case, you have other options.


A voice call is your best option for contacting emergency services. Texts are not always read right away and, if you accidentally leave out information, a back and forth exchange can take awhile. Even if you're in an area where texting 9-1-1 is an option, only use it when calling 9-1-1 is not possible., If possible, ask someone else to call 9-1-1. You could ask a friend or family member to do so if you're hearing impaired, for example. If you're unable to talk due to a medical emergency, try to write down that you need someone to call 9-1-1 if possible.

, You may be texting 9-1-1 because you are in a situation where an aggressor is nearby. You do not want him or her to know you're reaching out to emergency services. In this case, you can text someone else to text 9-1-1.


As you would do when texting 9-1-1, let this other person know the nature of the emergency. Tell them where you are, what services you need, and why you need them.
For example, you could text a friend, ""Uber driver took me way off track, is becoming aggressive, we're on Highway 101 heading north near exit 43, call the police.""

’’Serous drainage:’’ This type of drainage can manifest as a clear colorless drainage or a slightly yellowish discharge. This sort of drainage is not produced enough that it can soak a bandage.
’’Serosanguinous drainage:’’ This type of drainage manifests as a thin, watery discharge that is made of blood and serum. Because there is only a small amount of blood, the discharge may be pinkish.;
, While it is helpful to know what is normal, it is also important to be aware of what to look out for in the event of infection. Types of abnormal wound drainage include:


’’Sanguinous drainage:’’ This type of drainage has a lot of blood in it. It will be bright red.
’’Purulent discharge:’’ This is also known as pus. The color of pus discharge varies— it can be green, yellow, white, gray, pink, or brown. Pus normally smells very bad.

, Washing your hands will limit the amount of bacteria that you expose your wound to. Proper hand washing involves:


Wetting the hands with warm or cold water.
Lathering the hands using soap.
Scrubbing hands for as long as 30 seconds to effectively remove bacteria and dirt.
Rinsing the hands under running water.
Drying the hands using a clean towel.

, While washing your hands is generally enough to keep your wound from becoming infected, water and soap will still leave microbes behind on your hands. Because of this, wearing gloves will serve as a further barrier between bacteria and your wound.


Remove the gloves after you have treated the draining wound.

, Washing and cleaning the draining wound with hydrogen peroxide or povidone iodine will help remove old dead skin cells and wound debris. Antiseptic solution contain germ-killing components can facilitate wound healing.


Cleaning a draining wound should be once a day, or when the bandage over the wound get soiled or wet.
Before cleaning the wound using an antiseptic solution, be sure you have washed it under running water.
When cleaning using hydrogen peroxide or povidone iodine,, pour the solution on a cotton ball or piece of gauze and run it gently over the wound. Clean the wound in a circular motion, starting from the center of the wound and working your way out to the edges of the wound.

, This ointment can both fight off bacteria and help your skin to retain moisture. Commonly used antibacterial ointments include:


Bacitracin (Neosporin). Apply this to the wound 3 times a day.
2% Mupirocin (Bactroban). Apply this to the wound 3 times a day every 8 hours.

, Cover the wound before the ointment you have put on it dries. Your wound should be kept moist, as too much dryness can cause the healing skin to breakdown.


Put a piece of clean gauze over the wound and tape the edges of the gauze down with medical tape. Alternately, some large gauze bandages come with adhesives on the bandage already.

, Keep your dressing dry and clean, as this will help to keep your wound from getting infected. If you notice that the bandage is damp, replace it with a new one.


If your dressing gets soaked, it should be changed immediately to avoid spreading bacteria found in the wound discharges.

, You should monitor the amount and characteristic of your wound’s drainage. Normal wound drainage releases only mild to moderate amounts of discharge.


If the bandage gets soaked several times a day, it indicates that you are experiencing abnormal wound drainage.
You should call you doctor right away and go to the nearest hospital as severe wound bleeding or hemorrhage can potentially be fatal due to excessive blood loss.

Get a tetanus shot if the cut is dirty or deep.",How to Treat a Cut Finger," Doing this will limit the risk of you infecting the cut with bacteria from your hands.If you have access to disposable medical gloves, put one on your uninjured hand to prevent exposing the cut to the bacteria on your hand.;
, Use clear, running water to rinse the wound. Take a clean washcloth, wet it, and dip it in soap. Clean around the wound with the soapy washcloth, but keep soap out of the cut, as it can cause irritation. Pat the cut dry with a clean towel once you have cleaned it.If there is dirt or debris in the cut after you have rinsed it and washed around it, use tweezers to remove the debris. Dip the tweezers in rubbing alcohol to sanitize it before you use it on your cut.
You do not need to use hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, iodine, or an iodine-based cleanser on the cut, as these products can be irritating to the damaged tissue.
If debris still remains the cut, or is hard to remove, you should seek professional medical care at your nearest clinic or hospital.

, If blood is squirting out of the cut, you’ve cut an artery and will require emergency care right away. You likely will not be able to stop the bleeding on your own. Apply pressure to an artery cut with a clean washcloth, towel, or sterile gauze and go to the emergency room. Do not attempt to apply a tourniquet to the cut.


If blood is oozing out of the cut, this means you’ve cut a vein. Vein cuts will stop bleeding after about 10 minutes, with the proper care, and can usually be treated at home.As with any severe bleed, apply pressure using sterile gauze or dressings to the wound.

, A deep wound that goes all the way through your skin and is gaping, with exposed fat or muscle, will need stitches. You should go to emergency care as soon as possible if the cut is deep enough for stitches. If the cut appears to be just below the surface of your skin and has minimal bleeding, you can treat it at home.Properly closing a deep wound within a few hours with stitches will minimize scarring and reduce your risk of infection.
Generally, if the cut is less than 3 cm in length, less than 1/2 cm (1/4 inch) deep, and no lower structures are involved (muscle, tendon, etc.), the cut is considered minor and can be treated without stitches.

, Minor cuts usually stop bleeding after several minutes on their own. If the cut on your finger is oozing blood, use a clean cloth or a sterile bandage to apply gentle pressure to the cut.Elevate the cut by raising your finger over your head, above your heart. Keep the dressing on the cut as you raise it over your head to soak up the blood.

, Once the bleeding is stemmed, applying a thin layer of Neosporin or Polysporin on the cut will help keep the surface of the cut moist. These products will not make your cut heal faster, but they will prevent infection and encourage your body to start the natural healing process.Some people may develop a rash due to the ingredients in these ointments. Stop using the ointment if you develop a rash.

, Cover the cut with a bandage to keep it clean and prevent harmful bacteria from getting into the cut.Use a waterproof band-aid or plaster so you can keep the bandage on while you are in the shower. If the bandage does become wet, remove it, air dry the wound, re-apply any creams you have been using and re-bandage.

, If the cut is painful, take an ibuprofen to help relieve the pain. Only take the suggested amount on the bottle.A minor cut should heal within a few days.
Do not take aspirin as it is a known blood thinner and cause you to bleed more from the cut., You should also change the dressing if the bandage becomes wet or dirty.After the cut has healed enough and there is a scab forming on the cut, you can leave it uncovered. Exposing it to the air will speed up healing.

, These are all symptoms of a possible infection. You should get the cut looked at by a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms.If you lose mobility in your hand or experience numbness of your finger, you may have a more serious infection and should see a doctor right away.Red streaks radiating from the cut are a sign of severe infection and medical attention should be sought immediately.
If your cut was from an animal bite or a human bite, you should get it checked by a doctor. An animal bite, especially from a wild animal like a raccoon or a squirrel, may pose a rabies risk.Domestic animals and humans have bacteria in their mouths that, once embedded in the skin, can greatly increase chance of infection.

, Once the doctor has cleaned the cut and given you stitches for the deep cut, you should ask about getting a tetanus shot to prevent infection.As well, if you haven’t had a tetanus shot in the past five years and the cut is serious, you should get a tetanus shot as soon as possible.

Wash your hands in warm tap water with antibacterial soap.Get your hands wet under clean, running water. Then, lather your hands with soap. Make sure to get between your fingers, under your fingernails, and the backs of your hands.
Make sure to scrub for at least 20 seconds. To help you keep track of time, try humming the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice.
Rinse your hands and dry them with a clean, dry towel.;
, The first thing you want to do with a graze is work on stopping the bleeding. If the graze is minor, bleeding should stop on its own. If the bleeding does not stop within a few minutes, apply pressure to the wound using a sterile bandage or a clean cloth. It can also help to elevate the wound slightly while applying pressure., Once you've stopped the bleeding, clean the graze. This can help prevent infection. To clean the graze, run it under tap water. Do not use antiseptic, as this can irritate the skin. When the wound is cleaned out, gently pat it dry with a clean towel., To prevent infection, it's a good idea to apply an over-the-counter antibacterial cream or ointment. Neosporin or Polysporin would work well. Apply a layer to the wound, following the instructions on the package.In addition to preventing infection, your antibiotic cream can also speed the healing of your wound by keeping it moist and free of bacteria.If you are allergic to any ingredient in a product, don't use it. Discontinue use and consult your doctor if you develop a rash, hives, itching, skin irritation, burning, cracking, peeling, or worsening of your injury.

, You can either use an adhesive bandage with a non-stick pad or a non-stick gauze to cover the graze. Don't use a gauze that lacks a non-stick surface because it can stick to the wound and pull off skin when you remove it, preventing your wound from healing. Make sure the covering is big enough to protect the full graze, and the skin surrounding the graze.If you are allergic to adhesive, apply a non-stick gauze pad and wrap it with paper tape, rolled gauze, or a loosely applied elastic bandage., Use healing ointments such as antibacterial creams to keep your wound moist as it heals. Keeping a wound moist will help it heal faster and will prevent the skin from pulling apart as you move, which delays healing.It's especially important to keep wounds on joints, like your knees, moist because they endure a lot of movement.

, If you grazed your skin when falling outside, there may be foreign objects lodged in the graze. These should be removed before you clean and dress the wound. If left in, they can cause infection. You can usually run water over the wound to remove things like dirt and debris., You should not leave dressing on the wound for too long. This can increase the risk of infection. Make sure to change the graze's dressing at least once a day.Early on, you may have to change the dressing more. If the bandage gets wet from pus or blood, change it.

, Understanding the risk factors for infection is important. You should be more vigilant about checking the graze if it was accrued under certain circumstances.If any dirt or bodily fluids from another person got in the wound, you're at an increased risk for infection.
A wound caused by a human or animal bite is at a greater risk of infection, though these wounds are usually deeper than a graze.If your wound is longer than 5 centimeters, or 2 inches, it's more likely to become infected.

, In rare cases, grazes can appear infected. See a doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms:Pain, redness, or swelling around the graze
Pus around the wound
A feeling of sickness
A high temperature
Swollen glands

, If you need a tetanus shot, you should get one if you have a new graze or wound. Check your vaccination records. You can ask your doctor for your medical records. If you're younger, your parents may have copies of the vaccination records on hand., Most grazes will stop bleeding on their own. If the bleeding does not stop, see a doctor. If blood is coming out in spurts, you may have grazed an artery, which usually occurs with a deep graze called a skin avulsion injury.This will require stitches., While dirt and debris can be removed with water, an x-ray may be needed to remove larger foreign bodies from the wound. If you suspect something like glass may be embedded in the wound, see your doctor. He or she can take an x-ray to check for foreign bodies and have a doctor determine the best method to remove the object., A graze that is deep or wide may require stitches or special adhesive bandages with non-stick pads. See your doctor if your wound is not healing up on its own. He or she can provide you with stitches or special dressing for you wound."

Wash your hands.,
Avoid contaminating the wound.,
Tilt the injured person’s head forward.,
Check for associated injuries.,
Confirm that the person is up to date on vaccines.,

Clean the wound.,
Apply pressure.,
Check the wound after 15 minutes.,
Contact a medical professional if necessary.,
Know what to expect.,

Consider applying a topical antiseptic product or natural alternative.,
Restrict the range of mouth movement.If the injured person opens his mouth too wide—when yawning, laughing hard, or taking large bites of food, for example— this could cause unnecessary discomfort and may reopen the wound.,
Follow a soft diet.The less chewing the injured person has to do, the less chance there is of reopening the wound.,
Report signs of infection to a doctor immediately.",How to Treat a Cut Lip," Before treating any kind of wound, you should always make sure that your hands are as clean as possible, to avoid infecting the wound with anything you may be carrying on your skin. Use warm water and anti-bacterial hand soap, if you have it available. It may be helpful to also use an antibacterial hand sanitizer after washing hands.Use vinyl gloves if you have them available. Latex gloves are also okay, but be sure that the person whose lip you are treating is not allergic to latex. The important thing is to create a barrier of clean, sterile material between your hand and the wound.;
, Try your best to avoid breathing or coughing/sneezing near the site of the wound., Have the person whose lip is bleeding sit up, then forward and tilt his chin down toward his chest. By draining the blood forward, out of the mouth, you’re preventing him from swallowing his own blood, which can cause vomiting and could create a choking hazard., Often when a person's mouth is injured, there are other related injuries that were caused by the initial trauma. Seek medical care immediately if any of these occur. These may include:Loose or missing teeth
Fractures to the face or jaw
Difficulty swallowing or breathing

, If the trauma that caused the wound involved a piece of metal or other dirty items or surfaces, the injured person could be at risk for a tetanus infection.Infants and young children should receive tetanus shots at the age of two months (in the form of the DTaP vaccine), four months, and six months, and again at 15 months through 18 months of age, with a booster given between ages 4 through 6 years of age.If the injured person has a dirty wound, he should make sure he has had a tetanus booster shot within the last 5 years. If he has not, he should receive one.Adolescents and teenagers should be given a booster shot some time between the ages of 11 through 18 years old.Tetanus booster shots should be administered to adults every ten years., Ask the injured person to remove any jewelry that might be around the cut, including tongue or lip rings. Also remove any food or gum that may have been in the mouth when the injury occurred., This step is important in order to prevent infection and reduce the risk of scarring.If there are objects in the wound itself — like dirt particles or pebbles — remove them by having the injured person place the wound under a running faucet until it’s clean of particles.If that’s uncomfortable for the person, fill a glass with water and pour it over the wound. Keep refilling the glass until you’ve washed the matter out of the wound.
Use a cotton swab dipped in hydrogen peroxide to deep clean the wound. Just be sure the injured person does not accidentally swallow any peroxide., It's best if the person who is bleeding applies pressure to his own lip, but if you must assist, be sure to wear clean rubber gloves.Using a clean towel or piece of gauze or a bandage, apply gentle but firm pressure to the cut for a full 15 minutes. If the towel, gauze or bandage becomes completely saturated with blood, apply additional gauze or bandages without removing the first layer., The cut may trickle or spot blood for upwards of 45 minutes, but if there is steady bleeding after the first 15 minutes you may need to seek medical help.The mouth—including gums, tongue, and lips—has a lot of blood vessels and a heavy blood supply, so oral lesions tend to bleed more than cuts on other parts of the body.Apply the pressure inward, toward the teeth, jaw, or gums.
If this is uncomfortable for the injured person, place gauze or clean cloth between the person’s teeth and lip, then resume applying pressure., If the bleeding has not stopped after 15 minutes of steady pressure, if the injured person has problems breathing or swallowing, if he has loose teeth or if his teeth seem out of their usual position, if you are unable to remove all dirt or debris, or you are concerned he may have other injuries to his face, you should contact a doctor to see if the injury needs stitches or other professional treatment. Do this as soon as possible, as the chances of infection increase the longer you leave a wound open and bleeding. If you have any doubt, make sure to contact a doctor.


If the cut goes all the way through the lip, it's important to seek medical assistance immediately.If the cut is on the red part of the lip as well as on the normal colored skin above or below the lip (crosses the vermillion border), the injured person should see a doctor for stitches. Stitches will reduce the risk of infection and help make sure the wound heals in the best cosmetic way.
Doctors recommend stitches if the cut is deep and gaping, meaning that you can place fingers on either side of the cut and gently pry it open with minimal effort.Doctors may also recommend stitches if there is a flap of skin that can easily be sutured.Deep lacerations that require stitches should not wait more than 8 hours, maximum, to receive safe treatment., Small cuts inside the mouth usually heal within three to four days, but more serious injuries or deeper cuts may take longer to heal, especially if the cut is on a part of the lip that encounters a lot of movement during eating and drinking.If the injured person has seen a doctor, he should follow the doctor's instructions for care of the wound, including any medications prescribed such as antibiotics.

, An ice pack or a few ice cubes wrapped up in a clean dish towel or clean sandwich bag can help soothe the pain and reduce inflammation.Apply a cold compress for 20 minutes on, followed by 10 minutes off., After you’ve stemmed the initial bleeding, you need to start treating the wound so it heals cleanly. There is some disagreement in the medical world about whether antiseptic creams are necessary or even helpful, particularly if the creams are used excessively.However, some research does suggest they can be helpful in healing if used correctly and appropriately.


If you do choose to use a topical antiseptic cream, you can buy one over the counter at any pharmacy or grocery/convenience store. If in doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist which products might be best for your wound. Make sure you use your chosen product only as directed to avoid applying too much or too frequently.
As an alternative, you can apply honey or granulated sugar to the wound. Sugar draws water out of the wound, preventing bacteria from getting the hydration they need to grow. Honey also has antibacterial properties.Studies have shown that applying sugar or honey to a wound before dressing it can reduce pain and prevent infection., In the latter case, the person would once again be susceptible to the dangers of infection, and have to begin the healing process from the beginning.

, He should also drink as much fluids as possible to keep the body and tissues hydrated; this also helps prevent the wound from reopening.


Avoid contact between the wound and salt or citrus, as this can cause uncomfortable burning pain.Avoid eating hard, crunchy, or sharp foods like potato or tortilla chips.
Run warm water over the wound after meals to clean out any particles that may have been left behind.Contact a doctor if the injured person is having difficulty eating or drinking due to the cut.

, Although you’ve done what you could to prevent infection and further injury, sometimes things don’t go your way. Contact a medical professional immediately if you observe the following symptoms:A fever of 100.4ºF or higher
Unusually low body temperature
Redness, swelling, increased warmth or pain, or pus in the wound
Decreased urination
Rapid pulse
Rapid breathing
Nausea and vomiting
Diarrhea
Difficulty opening the mouth
Redness, tenderness, or swelling of the skin around the cut

Check for swelling.,
Respond to a fracture.,
Clean the wound.,
Assess the lacerations.,
Look for tendon injury.,
Evaluate the fingernail.",How to Treat a Finger Hit by a Hammer1," Your finger will likely swell no matter how hard you hit it. This is the most common response to such trauma. If the hit wasn't too forceful, your finger may just swell for a couple of days. If the only symptom you see is swelling, place an ice pack on your finger to help relieve the swelling and pain.


You can take over-the-counter pain medication to help relieve the pain as well.
An NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) can help relieve the inflammation and pain. Take as directed on the packaging.You don't need to see a doctor unless the swelling won't go down, you develop serious pain or numbness, or you can't move your finger all the way in or all the way out.;
, If the swelling is really bad and you are in extreme pain, you may have fractured your finger, especially if you hit your finger quite hard. If your finger looks contorted and is extremely sensitive to the touch, you likely fractured your finger. This may be accompanied by bleeding skin or a smashed fingernail.


If you think you have a fracture, seek medical attention. You need an X-ray and the doctor may give you a finger splint or some other form of treatment. Do not put a splint on your finger unless a doctor tell you to do so., If your finger is bleeding after you hit it, you need to clean the wound so you can assess the damage. If there is visible bleeding, cleanse the wound with running warm water. Run the warm water over the wound with the run-off going down the drain, not back into the wound. Then, using a gauze pad, cleanse the entire wound surface with Betadine or other cleansing solutions.


Put pressure on your wound for a few minutes to slow the flow of blood, which will help you assess how deep the wound is and if you need to see a doctor.
If there is excessive bleeding or squirting blood, seek medical attention immediately., Once you've cleaned the wound, you need to evaluate the finger for any lacerations, or cuts. The wound still may bleed a little while you check, which is fine. Lacerations often show up in the form of tears or flaps of skin on the surface of your finger. Any obviously destroyed tissue or any skin that has been torn off and left a raw bleeding finger pad needs to be examined by a doctor. Lacerations may need to be stitched if the wound is 1/2 inch or larger. However, if there is a section of completely destroyed skin, it is unlikely to be salvaged.


Many doctors will still suture damaged or destroyed skin over the raw finger pad as protection while new skin grows back over the area. The skin will them be removed once new skin has formed.
Lacerations may be shallow and stop bleeding soon after you get them, especially if you didn't hit your finger that hard. If this is the case, wash the wound, put antibiotic ointment on them, and wrap them with a bandage., Since your hand and fingers are an intricate system of muscles, tendons, and nerves, it's important to examine your finger for signs of tendon injury. Tendons connect muscles to your bones. Your hand has two types of tendons: flexor tendons, on the palm side, that bend the fingers; and extensor tendons, on the back of the hand, that straighten the fingers. Cuts and smashes can damage or even sever these tendons.A torn or cut tendon in the finger will make it impossible to bend your finger.
A cut on the palm side of the hand or near the skin folds at the joints of your fingers may signal injury to the tendon below.
You may also feel numbness due to associated nerve damage.
Tenderness on the palm side of your hand may signal an injured tendon.
You may want to request a hand surgeon if you show any of these signs, as repairing the hand and fingers can be a very intricate process.

, If you hit your fingernail with the hammer, there may be significant damage to it. Look at your fingernail and assess the damage. If there is a small blood blister underneath the fingernail, there is no need to see a doctor. Just ice the wound and take over the counter medication if there is any initial pain. If the pain lasts for days, if the blood blister takes up more the 25% of your fingernail, or if the blood is causing significant pressure under your fingernail, seek medical attention. You likely have a subungual hematoma.


You may also find that a portion of the fingernail has become detached or has been cut. If you have a significant cut in the nail bed, seek medical attention because you will likely need stitches. If you don't get it treated, the cut may prevent nail growth, cause the nail to grow in a distorted manner, or cause infection.
If the fingernail is partially or entirely gone, seek medical attention right away. This is a serious problem and needs attention. The fingernail may be removed or stitched up until a new, healthy fingernail can grow back. This can take up to six months."
"
See your doctor.,
Evacuate the blood at the doctor's office.,
Get rid of the hematoma at home.,
Re-clean the fingernail.",How to Treat a Finger Hit by a Hammer2," If the collection of blood under your fingernail is significant, which means it takes up more than 25% of your fingernail, see your doctor. You have a subungal hematoma, which is an area of broken small blood vessels under your fingernail. Your doctor will likely suggest that your nail get evacuated/lanced. When you react quickly enough you can do it yourself. If you notice severe throbbing, then push back the cuticle as far as it will go to gently slip in the sterilized needle. It will hurt less than your throbbing finger and the needle will go in easier at the nail base where it grows out. Let the blister drain a couple times until lymph flows (runs clear). This will prevent the black nail of dried blood under the nail.


If the blood under the fingernail only covers 25% or less of your nail, you don't have to do anything to it. The blood will work itself up your fingernail as it grows. Depending on how hard your thumb was hit will mean how much your fingernail becomes black as the blood dries. If the hematoma is bigger than 50% of the fingernail, your doctor will request a finger X-ray.
You should see a doctor to treat hematomas within 24-48 hours.

, The safest way to evacuate the nail is to let your doctor perform the evacuation through cauterization. During this procedure, your doctor melts a small hole through your fingernail with an electric cauterization tool. Once the cautery hits the hematoma under the fingernail, the tip automatically cools. This prevents you from getting burned by the tool.


After the hole is made, the blood oozes out of the fingernail until the pressure is relieved. Your doctor will then bandage your finger and send you home.
The doctor may use an 18-gauge needle instead, although cauterization is preferred.
This process is painless because your fingernail has no nerves in it.This process helps relieve pressure building up under the nail, which means you're less likely to need the nail removed.

, Your doctor may advise you that it is okay to evacuate the hematoma at home. For this procedure, get a paperclip and a lighter and wash your hands thoroughly. Prepare the paper clip by unbending it and holding the lighter to the straight end until it is red and hot, about 10 to 15 seconds. Take the paper clip and place it at the center of the area that has the hematoma at a 90 degree angle from the nail bed. Gently press down with the paper clip, slowly twisting the hot paper clip edge back and forth in the same place to dig into the fingernail. Once you get through the fingernail, the blood will begin to ooze out of the nail. Grab a cloth or bandage to clean up the blood as it comes out.


If you can't get through it at first, reheat the tip of the paper clip and retry, pressing down just a little bit harder to get through the fingernail.

Do not do this too hard because you don't want to puncture your nail bed.
You can take pain medication before you start if your finger is hurting you a lot.
If you can't do it yourself, as a trusted friend or loved one to help you out., Once all the blood has been drained, you need to clean the fingernail again. Clean the fingernail again with Betadine or some other cleansing solution. Bandage the finger in rolling gauze, making a ball out of the gauze at the top of your finger. This will provide better cushion and protection from outside irritants and trauma. Secure the gauze at the base with medical tape.You may want to anchor the gauze with a figure eight type maneuver that goes from your finger to the base of your hand. This will help the bandage stay on.

Change the bandages.,
Look for signs of infection.,
Follow up with your doctor.",How to Treat a Finger Hit by a Hammer3," No matter what kind of damage or wound you have on your finger, change your dressings once a day. Change them sooner, however, if they become soiled before 24 hours have passed. When you take off the bandage each day, clean your finger with a sterile solution and rebandage it in the same manner you had it before.


If you have stitches, ask your doctor before cleaning them. Follow any instructions he or she gives you on how to care for the stitches. You will likely have to keep them dry and should not clean them with any solution., Whenever you remove the bandages, look for signs of infection in the wound on your finger. Notice if there is any pus, drainage, redness, or heat, especially migrating up from your hand or arm. Also take note if you begin to run a fever, as complications can develop, including infections such as cellulitis, a felon, or other hand infections., After you have had your finger injury for a few weeks, follow up with your doctor. If he or she treated the injury with stitches or hematoma evacuation, your doctor may schedule this. However, always follow up with your doctor when you go through any intense injury such as this.


Make sure you contact the doctor if you have additional symptoms, think you may be getting an infection, you get dirt or grime into the wound and can't get it out, you experience any additional or excessive pain, or your wound starts to bleed uncontrollably.You should also contact your doctor if you experience any symptoms of nerve damage, including: a lack of sensation, numbness, or the development of a ball-like scar called a ""neuroma"" that is often painful and causes an electrical sensation when touched."

Cover the dislocated joint with something sterile.,
Immobilize the joint.Try to use nonstick gauze such as Telfa if there is an open wound.,
Monitor the limb.,
Avoid offering food to the patient while treating dislocations.,
Know when to seek immediate medical help.,
Relieve pain around the dislocation by applying a cold pack to the area.This will also reduce swelling that can add to the discomfort of the injury.,
Offer Ibuprofen (Advil) or Acetaminophen (Tylenol) if the patient is in severe pain.,
Prepare the victim for what to expect treatment-wise.,
Begin rehabilitation once the joint can be used again.",How to Treat a Dislocation," It is important to take steps to prevent an infection, especially if there is any broken skin around the area of the dislocation.Wait until professional medical personnel arrive before attempting to wash or in any way ""clean"" the wound (if there is a wound, or if there are any areas of broken skin).Attempting to do so without the proper sterilizing equipment or medical training actually increases the chance of infection rather than decreasing it.
For now, covering the area is enough to decrease the chance of it becoming infected.;
, Note that it is very important not to try and re-position or re-align the joint in any way. This can cause further harm, and it is best to simply immobilize it in the position it is in and to wait for a trained medical professional to definitively treat the dislocation.


Be sure to immobilize both above and below the dislocated joint to ensure maximum stability while awaiting medical treatment.If it is the shoulder that is dislocated, you can use a sling (or make a sling by tying a long piece of fabric into a circle) to immobilize it. Make sure the sling holds the limb against the body. Instead of just wrapping the sling around the neck, try wrapping it around the torso before tying it at the neck.
If it is another joint such as a knee or elbow, a splint is your best bet. Splints can be constructed of sticks or another stabilizing device and tape or fabric strips to hold the splint in place.

, This is to ensure it does not lose sensation, or exhibit a change in temperature or reduction in pulse. These signs could indicate an obstruction of blood flow or damage to the nerves leading down to the limb. If any of these changes occur, seek medical assistance for treating the dislocation immediately.


Check the pulse in the area of the limb farthest from the center of the body — in the wrist if the arm or shoulder is dislocated, on the top of the foot or behind the ankle bone if the injury is to a leg.

, Doctors usually prefer to work with a patient who has an empty stomach, particularly if surgery becomes necessary.

, If the patient exhibits any of the following signs or symptoms, call 911 immediately as it may be a medical emergency:Severe bleeding
Other traumatic injuries
A possible head, neck, or spine injury (do not move the person if you suspect a possible neck or spine injury as moving them can cause severe damage)
Loss of sensation in the affected joint or the extremities (fingers, toes, etc.)
Always seek medical help promptly, even if it does not fall into one of the above categories. Although these are more urgent and worrisome symptoms, all dislocations require prompt medical evaluation and treatment. If possible, drive the person to your local emergency room; if you are unable to do so, call 911 for assistance.

, Take care not to apply ice or cold packs directly to the skin while treating dislocations or damage to the skin could result; make sure you wrap the pack in a towel first.


Apply ice for no longer than 10 – 20 minutes at a time.

, Follow the recommended dosages on the bottle. Both of these medications are available over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy.

, Once the injured person gets to the hospital, medical staff will re-align the bones around the joint. This procedure is called ""reduction.""Often it requires the patient to be under partial sedation as it can be quite painful (however, in the long run, it diminishes pain by speeding recovery).


The doctor will then immobilize the joint for several weeks.He will be sure to immobilize it in the correct position, after everything has been re-aligned, and your body will naturally heal things from here.
Sometimes surgery is needed if your doctor cannot re-align the bones around the joint manually.In this case, the joint will be immobilized after surgery.

, Physical therapy usually takes a number of weeks and helps the patient regain range of motion in the joint. It also helps strengthen the muscles surrounding the joint so a subsequent injury is less likely.


Only begin using the limb according to your doctor’s instructions.

Consult with your family physician.,
Get a referral for an MRI.,
Consider a CT scan.",How to Tell if Your Wrist Is Sprained," Wrist sprains have a wide range of severity depending on the degree of stretch and/or tearing to the involved ligament. Mild wrist sprains (Grade 1), involve some ligament stretching, but no significant tearing; moderate sprains (Grade 2) involve significant tearing (up to 50% of the fibers); severe sprains (Grade 3) involve a greater amount of tearing or complete rupture of the ligament.Consequently, with Grade 1 and 2 wrist sprains, movement will be relatively normal, albeit painful. A Grade 3 sprain often leads to joint instability (too much mobility) with movement because the involved ligament is no longer properly attached to its wrist (carpal) bones. In contrast, movement is typically much more restricted with wrist fractures and there's often a grinding feeling with movement.


Grade 1 wrist sprains are mildly painful and the pain is usually described as a soreness that can be sharp with movement.
Grade 2 wrist sprains generate moderate-to-severe pain, depending on the degree of tearing; the pain is sharper than a Grade 1 tear and sometimes also throbbing because of inflammation.
Grade 3 wrist sprains are often less painful (initially) than Grade 2 varieties because the ligament is completely severed and not irritating surrounding nerves as much — although Grade 3 injuries eventually throb significantly due to accumulating inflammation.;
, Inflammation (swelling) is a common symptom of all wrist sprains, as well as wrist fractures, but it varies significantly according to the severity of injury.In general, Grade 1 sprains have the least amount of swelling, whereas Grade 3 sprains trigger the most. Swelling will make your sprained wrist look thicker and puffy compared to your uninjured wrist. The body's inflammation response to injury, especially sprains, tends to be an over-reaction because it's anticipating the worst care scenario — an open wound susceptible to infection. As such, trying to limit inflammation triggered by a sprain with cold therapy, compresses, and/or anti-inflammatory drugs is beneficial because it reduces pain and helps to maintain range of motion in your wrist.


Swelling from inflammation doesn't cause much color change to skin, aside from some redness from ""flushing"" due to all the warm fluid underneath the skin.
Due to the accumulation of inflammation, which consists of lymph fluid and a variety of specialized immune system cells, a sprained wrist will feel warm to the touch. Most wrist fractures also feel warm due to inflammation, but sometimes the wrist and hand can feel cold because the circulation gets cut off due to blood vessel damage.

, Although the body's inflammation reaction creates swelling at the site of injury, that's not the same as bruising.Instead, bruising is caused by blood that seeps into surrounding tissues from injured blood vessels (small arteries or veins). Grade 1 wrist sprains usually don't lead to bruising, unless the injury was from a hard blow that crushed the small subcutaneous blood vessels directly underneath the skin. Grade 2 sprains involve more swelling, but again, not necessarily lots of bruising — it depends how the injury occurred. Grade 3 sprains involve lots of swelling and typically significant bruising because trauma that causes a completely torn ligament is usually severe enough to also rip or damage surrounding blood vessels.


The dark color of bruising is caused by blood seeping into the tissues just below the skin's surface. As the blood degrades and gets flushed out of the tissue, the bruise changes color with time (dark blue, green, then yellow).
In contrast to sprains, wrist fractures almost always exhibit bruising because it takes more trauma (force) to break a bone.
A Grade 3 wrist sprain can lead to an avulsion fracture, where the ligament tears away a small chip of bone.In this case, there's lots of immediate pain, inflammation and bruising.

, Wrist sprains of all grades respond well to cold therapy because it reduces inflammation and numbs surrounding nerve fibers that generate pain.Cold therapy (ice or frozen gel packs) is especially important for Grade 2 and 3 wrist sprains because they trigger the accumulation of more inflammation around the injury site. Applying cold therapy to a sprained wrist for 10-15 minutes every one to two hours immediately following an injury makes a noticeably positive impact after a day or two by significantly reducing the intensity of pain and making movement easier. In contrast, icing a wrist fracture is helpful for pain and inflammation control also, but the symptoms often return after the effects wear off. Thus, as a general guideline, cold therapy tends to be more impactful on sprains than it is on most fractures.


Small hairline (stress) fractures tend to mimic Grade 1 or 2 sprains and do respond to cold therapy (long term) better than more serious fractures.
When applying cold therapy to your inured wrist, make sure to wrap it in a thin towel so as to avoid skin irritation or frost bite.

, Although the above information can help you understand if your wrist is sprained and roughly gauge to what extent, your doctor is much more qualified to make an accurate diagnosis. In fact, a detailed history leads to a specific diagnosis in about 70% of wrist pain cases.Your doctor will examine your wrist and perform some orthopedic tests on it, and if the injury appears severe, they will likely send you for a wrist x-ray to rule out a fractured bone. X-rays only show bones, however, and not soft tissues such as ligaments, tendons, blood vessels, or nerves.Broken carpal bones, particularly hairline fractures, can be tricky to see on x-ray because of their small size and the confined space. If the x-rays are negative for a wrist fracture, but your injury is severe and in need of surgery, the doctor might send you for an MRI or CT scan.


Small stress fractures of carpal bones (particularly the scaphoid bone) are very difficult to see on regular x-rays until all the inflammation fades away. Thus, you may have to wait a week or so to get another x-ray. These types of injuries may also require additional imaging such as MRI or splinting/casting depending on severity of symptoms and mechanism of injury.
Osteoporosis (a condition characterized by demineralization and brittle bones) is a significant risk factor for wrist fractures, although it doesn't increase the risk of wrist sprains.

, For all Grade 1 wrist sprains and most Grade 2 sprains, there's no need for an MRI or other high-tech diagnostic test because the injuries are short-lived and tend to heal within a few weeks without any medical treatment. However, for more serious ligament sprains (especially Grade 3 varieties) or if the diagnosis remains unclear, then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is warranted.An MRI uses magnetic waves to provide detailed images of all structures within the body, including soft tissues. MRI is great for visualizing which ligament is badly torn and to what extent. This is very helpful information for an orthopedic surgeon if surgery is required.


Tendinitis, ruptured tendons and bursitis of the wrist (including carpal tunnel syndrome) mimic wrist sprains, but an MRI can distinguish between the different injuries.
An MRI is also helpful to see the extent of blood vessel and nerve damage, particularly if your wrist injury is causing symptoms in your hand, such as numbness, tingling and/or loss of normal color.
Another cause of wrist pain that can mimic a low-grade sprain is osteoarthritis — the wear and tear type. However, osteoarthritis pain is chronic, gets slowly worse over time and typically involves a grinding feeling with wrist movement.

, If your wrist injury is pretty severe (and not improving) and the diagnosis remains unclear after x-rays and an MRI, then further imaging modalities such as a CT scan are indicated. Computerized tomography (CT) scans combine x-ray images taken from different angles and use computer processing to create cross-sectional images (slices) of all hard and soft tissues inside your body.CT images provide more detailed information than regular x-rays, but similar levels of detail to MRI images. In general, CT is excellent for evaluating hidden fractures of the wrist, although MRI tends to be better for evaluating more subtle ligament and tendon injuries.However, CT scans are typically less expensive than MRI, so this may be a factor if your health insurance won't cover costs of diagnosis.


CT scans expose you to ionizing radiation. The amount of radiation is more than plain x-rays, but not enough to be considered harmful.
The most common ligament sprained in the wrist is the scapho-lunate ligament, which connects the scaphoid bone to the lunate bone.If all the above mentioned diagnostic imaging results are negative, but your severe wrist pain persists, then your doctor will likely refer you to an orthopedic (bone and joint) specialist for more testing and evaluation.

Apply ice or cold therapy.,
Elevate your foot to reduce inflammation.,
Cut back on walking, running and other exercises.,
Take over-the-counter medication short term.",How to Tape a Broken Pinky Toe," Most fractures of the toes, including the pinky, are stress or hairline fractures, which are tiny cracks in the bone's surface.Stress fractures are often quite painful and involve some swelling and/or bruising in the forefoot area, but they don't cause the bones to look crooked, crushed, mangled or sticking out of the skin. As such, simple stress or hairline fractures are appropriate to tape, although more complicated fractures need different medical procedures, such as surgery, casting or splints.


See your doctor for an x-ray of your foot if the pain doesn't get significantly better within a few days. Stress fractures can be difficult to see on x-ray if there's lots of swelling.
If there is lots of swelling, your doctor may recommend a bone scan to identify the stress fracture.
Stress fractures of the pinky can occur with strenuous exercise (lots of jogging or aerobics, for examples), improper training techniques at the gym, trauma from stubbing the toe or dropping something heavy on it, and severely sprained ankles.;
, Any time you're dealing with a body injury by using some sort of supportive tape, it's best to clean the area first. Cleaning the area will remove bacteria and other microorganisms that could potentially cause an infection (such as fungus), as well as any dirt and debris that can prevent the tape from sticking well to your toes.Regular soap and warm water is usually sufficient for cleaning your feet and toes.


If you really want to sanitize your toes / feet and remove most of the natural oils, use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel or lotion.
Make sure to completely dry your toes and the spaces in between before any using gauze or tape.

, Once you've identified that your pinky toe is broken, but not too severely, then the first step of buddy taping is to put some gauze, felt or piece of cotton between your little toe and the toe next to it (called the 4th toe).This will prevent skin irritation and any potential blistering as your 2 lateral toes are taped together. Preventing skin irritation / blistering reduces the risk of developing an infection.


Use enough sterile gauze, felt or cotton balls between your 4th and 5th toes so that it doesn't easily fall out before securing it with tape.
If your skin is sensitive to medical tape (maybe it gets irritated and itchy from the adhesive), then wrap the gauze completely around your 4th and 5th toes and cover as much of the skin as possible before using tape.

, After you've placed some sterile gauze, felt or cotton between your toes, loosely tape the 4th and 5th toes together with some medical or surgical tape made for applying to the body. This is the buddy tape method, as you're essentially using your 4th toe as a splint to support, stabilize and protect your broken pinky toe.Tape from the base of the toes up to about 1/4 inch from the top of the toes. Wrap the tape around twice using 2 separate strips so it doesn't get too tight.


Wrapping the tape too tight will cut off circulation and turn the ends of your toes a purplish-blue color. Your toes will also feel numb or tingly if you've wrapped the tape too tight.
Reduced circulation to your toes also slows down the healing process, so make sure to buddy tape the toes together firmly, but loose enough that blood flows normally.
If you don't have any medical or surgical tape (sold at regular pharmacies), then duct tape, electrician's tape or small (narrow) Velcro straps can work also.
Most simple (stress) fractures of the toes take about 4 weeks or so to heal properly, so plan on buddy taping for the majority of that time.

, Buddy taping toes together to give support and promote healing is an ongoing process, not just a one-time procedure. If you shower or bathe every day, then you should re-tape your toes on a daily basis because wet gauze or felt is less effective at preventing blisters and the water starts to dissolve the adhesive glue on the tape.As such, remove the old tape and gauze after bathing and use dry gauze or cotton and fresh tape after your feet are clean and dry.


If you bathe every other day, then you can wait an additional day to re-tape your toes unless your feet get wet from some other reason, such as getting caught in a rainstorm or flood.
Using water resistant medical / surgical tape may reduce the frequent need to re-tape, but any time the gauze / cotton between your toes gets wet (or even damp) you should redo it.
Remember not to use too much tape (even if it's loosely applied) because you may not be able to fit your foot into your shoes properly. Too much tape also triggers overheating and sweating.

, Even before you see a doctor to confirm a stress fracture of your pinky toe, you should apply ice or some form of cold therapy to any musculoskeletal injury in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain.Use crushed ice wrapped in a thin towel (so it doesn't cause frostbite) or a frozen gel pack on the front part of your foot. Small bags of frozen veggies work well also.


Apply the ice or cold therapy for no more than 20 minutes at a time to the lateral (outside) part of your foot. Use the cold therapy 3-5x daily for the first few days post injury.
Wrap the ice bag or gel pack around the front of your foot with an elastic bandage for better results because compression helps to reduce swelling too.

, While you're applying ice to your lateral forefoot in order to combat the swelling, it's also a good idea to keep your foot elevated.Elevating your foot reduces blood flow, which helps to minimize inflammation during injuries. Prop your foot up whenever possible (before, during and after icing) so that it's higher than the level of your heart for best results.


If you're on the sofa, use a footstool or a few pillows to keep your leg / foot elevated above your heart.
While in bed lying down, use a pillow, folded blanket or foam roller to prop up your foot a few extra inches.
Always try to elevate both feet at the same time so you don't create hip, pelvis and/or low back pain or irritation.

, Another important element of home care for a broken toe is some rest and relaxation. In fact, resting by taking the weight off your foot is the primary treatment and recommendation for all stress fractures of the foot.As such, avoid the activity that triggered the injury and all other weight-bearing exercises (walking, hiking, jogging) that put weight on the lateral portion of the foot for 3-4 weeks.


Cycling can still be a good option for exercise and maintaining fitness if you're able to position the pedal closer to your heal and away from your toes.
Swimming is a non-weight bearing exercise and appropriate for a broken toe once the swelling and pain have subsided. Don't forget to re-tape your toes afterwards.

, Breaking a toe, even if it's just a stress or hairline fracture, is painful and managing the pain is an important part of the healing process. As such, in addition to applying cold therapy to dull the pain, consider taking over-the-counter medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) or painkillers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol).To minimize the chances of adverse side effects, such as stomach irritation, take these medications for less than 2 weeks on a daily basis. For most simple fractures, 3-5 days of medication should be sufficient.


NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) and aspirin. They are better for bone fractures because they inhibit swelling, whereas painkillers don't.
Aspirin should not be given to children, whereas ibuprofen should not be given to infants — stick with acetaminophen if your child needs pain relief.

Check for consciousness.,
Analyze their mental state.,
Determine their mental awareness.,
Examine their physical state.,
Check the victim's eyes.,
Analyze their exhaustion levels.,
Look for changes in their emotional state.",How to Tell If a Person Has a Concussion1," Although loss of consciousness is an easy indication of a concussion, it is not always requisite. Look to see if the person is responsive and can be roused with conversation. If they are unconscious, check their airways, breathing, and circulation to make sure they are all at normal levels.;
, If the victim is conscious, you can proceed to this analysis immediately. If they are unconscious, then you will have to wait until they regain consciousness. Someone who has suffered a concussion will exhibit:


A difficult time concentrating
Foggy thoughts
Loss of memory
Difficulty forming new memories
A feeling of slowness.

, If they seem to be acting strangely and are exhibiting the above symptoms of an altered mental state, ask a few questions to determine the extent of their incapacitation. Try asking general questions such as “what is your name?” and “what day is it?” If they are able to respond promptly and correctly to these, try asking a few more difficult memory-based questions.

, Ask them how they feel; sufferers of a concussion often have:


Nausea or vomiting
Strong headaches
Heightened sensitivity to light and sound
Problems with their balance.

, If you have a flashlight, shine the light into their eyes. Do their eyes focus on the light and the pupils react correctly? The pupils of the eyes focused completely on light should constrict (grow smaller). If there is no response or they have irregular eye movements, suspect a head injury, stroke, or serious ailment.

, Suffering from a concussion typically disrupts a person’s regular sleep schedule and their exhaustion levels. Check to see if the victim is:Very tired and requires more sleep than usual
Has difficulty falling asleep and insomnia
Sleeps much less than usual
Highly lethargic or more exhausted during the day than normal

, Sufferers of a concussion will exhibit:


Strange changes in their emotional state
High levels of anger, fear, sadness, or anxiety.
Mood swings and generally unstable emotions."
"
Examine their physical state.,
Look for changes in their mental state.,
Pay attention to their crying.,
Watch for changes in their behavior.,
Look out for loss of memory and skills.",How to Tell If a Person Has a Concussion2," Check your child for all of the aforementioned concussion symptoms that adults experience.


Unconsciousness
Nauseous or vomiting
Have difficulty staying awake
Their balance is impaired
Their pupils do not dilate

, In the period shortly after a concussion, there will likely be obvious changes in your child’s mental state.


They are very sad, abnormally anxious or scared, or throwing temper tantrums
They have a difficult time focusing or concentrating on anything

, Because children often get upset when they are injured, regardless of the extent of the injury, it may be difficult to tell if they have a concussion. Paying attention to their crying can help you determine if they are suffering from the brain injury or not.


The are crying significantly more than a usual injury
They are abnormally upset in addition to their extensive crying

, In the period of time following a possible concussion, watch your child for strange changes in their behavior.


They lack interest in doing things they normally enjoy
Their eating or nursing is different than usual
They generally behave in a way you would consider unusual

, Although your child may not be old enough to respond to questions accurately, watch for changes that might indicate they’ve lost memory or the knowledge of how to perform a specific skill. Have they recently been potty trained or taught to hold a bottle, but can no longer perform these activities or no longer seem to know how? Losing the memory of performing a skill can be an indication of a concussion."

Assess the seriousness of the injury.,
Remove any hair from the area.,
Consider spraying an adhesive over the area.,
Use an underlying wrap for sensitive skin.,
Lay down an anchor first.,
Make a side loop.,
Make a front loop.,
Tape over the distal joint if it's sprained.",How to Tape a Thumb," Taping an injured thumb is helpful if the injury is a sprain, strain or slight dislocation, but it's not a good idea for fractured or badly cut thumbs. Sprained thumbs cause mild-to-moderate sharp pain and often lead to some inflammation, redness and bruising.In contrast, a broken or severely dislocated thumb is typically very painful, looks crooked, moves unnaturally, and involves considerable inflammation and internal bleeding (bruising). These more serious types of injuries are not candidates for thumb taping and require immediate medical attention instead, which often involves splinting, casting and/or surgery.


Do not tape a severely cut thumb. Instead, clean the wound, put pressure on it to stop or slow the bleeding and wrap it in a bandage (if possible) before going to the hospital for an assessment.
""Buddy taping"" fingers together for support and protection is common for sprain injuries, but the thumb cannot be taped to the index finger. Doing so would put the thumb in an unnatural position and risk further injury. It would also prevent the index finger from being functional.;
, Once you've decided that your thumb injury is appropriate to tape, grab a safety razor and shave the entire area around the thumb and back of your hand (stopping at your wrist). The purpose of shaving the skin is to make the tape adhere better and to prevent irritation and pain when you need to take the tape off. In general, it's recommended that you shave the skin about 12 hours prior to taping, which allows it to heal from any irritation caused by the shaving.








Make sure to use shaving cream or other lubricants while shaving because it will reduce the risk of any nicks or cuts to your skin.
After you finish shaving, the skin should be thoroughly cleaned to remove any oils and sweat, then dried with a clean cloth. Don't apply any moisturizers because the tape won't stick as well.
Alcohol wipes are great for cleaning skin. The isopropyl alcohol is not only a good antiseptic, but it also gets rid of any oily or greasy residues that might prevent the tape from sticking to your skin.

, Cleaning your skin with soap and water and/or alcohol wipes is usually sufficient for the tape to stick well, but consider using some adhesive spray to get the best contact.Spray the adherent to your wrist, palm, thumb and back of your hand, then allow it to dry and become slightly tacky. Adhesive spray better prepares your skin for the athletic tape and prevents discomfort to sensitive skin while allowing easy removal.









Adhesive spray can be purchased at most pharmacies and all medical supply stores. Your physiotherapist or athletic therapist is also likely to have some.
Avoid breathing in as you spray the adherent because it can irritate your lungs and cause coughing spasms or sneezing.

, Although hypoallergenic (low-irritant) tape is widely available, those with especially sensitive skin should consider pre-wrapping their thumb and hand with a hypoallergenic underlay.Underlying hypoallergenic wraps are thin and soft and meant to go underneath the athletic tape.









Be careful not to wrap the underlying material too tight, particularly if you have diabetes or a circulatory problem, or if the wounded thumb has been swelling or is discolored, as the bandage and underlay can become too binding. This may lead to tissue damage.
Hypoallergenic underlying wraps are usually sold at the same places as athletic tape, adhesive spray and other medical and physical therapy supplies.

, Place a strip of tape in a comfortable (not too tight) ring around the base of your wrist, just below the bony prominences. This strip is considered an anchor, which gives support and provides fixation points for the various taping methods you can use to tape your thumb.Before taping the forearm area, make sure to position your wrist / hand in a neutral position — your wrist should be extended backwards a little.









Apply anchors gently and with care to prevent circulatory problems. If it's too tight, your hand/fingers will tingle, feel cooler to the touch and start to turn bluish.
You may also wish to add an anchor near the end of your thumb — near the most distal joint. However, this can sometimes cause the entire scaffolding come loose and get dirty. The single anchor around the wrist often works best with the figure eight loops around the thumb.
The best tape to use for the thumb is adhesive, water resistant, non-stretch (rigid), and between 25 – 50 mm in width., With your tape anchors laid down, make a side loop of smaller tape, (usually 10 or 20 mm maximum) at the hollow where you would take your pulse, just beneath the mound of your thumb. Wrap up your thumb, looping the tape around your thumb comfortably along the line of the webbing of your finger. Carry the tape back down, crossing it over the first strip and attaching it to the anchor tape directly beneath the index finger. The loop of tape should look like an 'awareness ribbon' wrapped around your thumb. Make at least two side loops. Your thumb should also be in a neutral position — look at the healthy hand in resting position for a guide.









For more support and rigidity, make three or four loops around the base of your thumb with the athletic tape.
The loops should not pull your thumb back so far that it looks like you're hitchhiking. Remember that your thumb may be hypermobile due to stretched ligaments, so try to tape it in a neutral position.

, After securing the side loop, make a few more in the opposite direction, which are called front loops.As the name implies, front loops start at the front of your wrist / forearm, then loop around the back of your thumb and return to the frontal (anterior) wrist area. Make at least two loops for good support or a few more if greater rigidity is required or wanted.









An alternative method for providing more stability is to take lengths of two inch (50mm) tape and wrap these over the loops, in the same direction as the anchor tape. Cover from where the loop tape starts at the back of the hand to the fleshy part of the palm under the thumb. Take these strips from anchor tape to the first joint of the thumb to support the muscles that attach the thumb to the hand.
Thumb taping should only be used if it is comfortable and does not cause more damage to the injury.
The tape should not be too tight because this will prevent blood flow to the thumb and this will cause more damage.

, There are two joints in the thumb: the proximal one closer to the palm, and the distal one closer to the thumbnail. The side and front loops are more for securing and supporting the proximal joint, which is sprained 








When this joint is involved, make sure the taping holds the thumb closer to the rest of the hand, to avoid catching the rigid, taped distal joint and re-injuring it.
There's no need to tape the distal joint if the proximal thumb joint is sprained because you'll have almost no mobility in your thumb.
Tapping directly over the distal thumb joint is a common preventative strategy in sports such as football, rugby and basketball.

Start at the ball of the foot.,
Wrap the top of the foot.,
Wrap the ankle.,
Repeat the figure 8.,
Fasten the bandage.",How to Wrap an Ankle1," Hold one end of the ace bandage against the ball of the foot, with the tail of the bandage extending past the outside of the foot, rather than the inside. Keep the tail rolled so that you can unroll it as you go, rather than dealing with an unwieldy long piece as you're trying to wrap.


For extra support, you can place a gauze pad on either side of the ankle before wrapping.
Horseshoe-shaped padding cut from foam or felt is also used for extra stability in compression wraps.;
, Use one hand to hold the end of the bandage against the ball of the foot. Bring the bandage over the foot, from outside to inside, then under the foot for a second wrap. Wrap the foot a total of three times, overlapping each wrap by half.


Use the same tension for each loop of the wrap. It should be firm, but not too tight.
Each loop of the wrap should be lined up evenly, rather than going in different directions. Start over if you need to do the job more neatly.

, After the third wrap, bring the bandage over the top of the foot, around the inside of the ankle, behind the ankle to the other side, and back over the instep and under the foot. The bandage should be woven over the foot and ankle in a figure 8, with the heel exposed.

, Make two more figure 8s, each time overlapping the bandage by half. When you're finished, the bandage should cover the entire foot and extend up past the ankle.


Smaller feet and legs may not require three full figure 8s with a full-sized ace bandage. Use your judgement to decide whether the wrap looks stable after 2 figure 8s.
Ask the person how the wrap feels after you're finished winding the bandage. If he or she complains that it's too tight, start over.

, Stretch the last segment of the bandage a bit and use the small metal prongs or velcro adhesive to secure the end of the bandage in place. Make sure the wrapping job is free of unnecessary lumps or bulges; it should be comfortable and neat.


Remove the bandage if the toes on the foot turn white or feel numb or tingly.
The bandage may be worn for a number of hours and during physical activities, or as recommended by the doctor. It should be removed twice a day to allow the blood in the foot to circulate freely.

"

Wrap the foot and ankle with underwrap.,
Create an anchor.,
Form the stirrup.,
Stabilize the foot and ankle with an ""x."",
Finish the tape wrap with three figure 8s.",How to Wrap an Ankle2," Start at the ball of the foot and wind the underwrap around the foot and up to and around the ankle, stopping a few inches above it. The heel may be left exposed.

, Wind the athletic tape around the top of the underwrap, a few inches above the ankle. Use a scissors to cut the tape and overlap the end with the starting point to make sure the tape stays in place. This is called the anchor because it forms the foundation for the rest of the tape wrap.


Don't wind the tape too tightly. It should be secure, but comfortable.
You may want to use more than one piece of tape for the anchor to make sure it stays in place.

, Align the tape with the outside of the ankle. Place the end of the tape on the stirrup, then wind it under the foot and up to the other side of the ankle. Secure it on the other side of the anchor. Repeat with two more pieces of tape that slightly overlap each other. This forms a stirrup, which helps keep the ankle stable during movement.

, Place the end of the tape at the ankle bone and extend it diagonally over the top of the foot, then wind it under the arch of the foot and toward the inside of the heel. Bring it around the heel and run it diagonally over the top of the foot to complete the ""x.""

, Place the end of the tape on the outside of the ankle. Wind it over the top of the foot, bring it under the arch, back over the other side of the foot, and around the ankle. Repeat this figure 8 shape a total of 3 times, overlapping the tape a bit each time.


Make sure the tape wrapping is comfortable for the person wearing it. If it pulls at the skin or hair, you may need to start over.
The tape wrap may be worn all day and during physical activity. It should be changed when it becomes dirty. Remove the wrap if the toes turn white or a numb or tingly sensation is felt.

"
"
Decide which way to wrap it.,
Prepare the ankle for the wrap.",How to Wrap an Ankle3," Both wrapping techniques have pros and cons, and the one you choose should be informed by your reason for wrapping the ankle. Take these factors into consideration when making your choice:


Ace bandages are used to make compression wraps. They are made from stretchy fabric that many find to be comfortable against the skin. They are secured with metal fasteners, or you can buy adhesive wraps that use velcro or glue to keep the wrap in place.

Ace bandages are conveniently reusable, so they're a good choice for people who need to wrap frequently.
Athletes may find ace bandages to be cumbersome when worn during physical activity. They create a bulky padding around the ankle that can make it more difficult to run and jump.


A wrap constructed from tape includes a bottom layer of underwrap, which protects the skin from getting pulled too much by the tape, and a layer of tape that is adhered to the underwrap in a pattern that supports the ankle.

Tape is not reusable, so it can get expensive for people who need to wrap every time they perform a physical activity. The underwrap protects the skin somewhat, but a little pulling usually takes place.
Tape feels lighter on the body, so many athletes prefer it to using an ace bandage when the wrap is intended to support the ankle during physical activity.



, Make sure the ankle and foot are clean and dry. Extend the leg and rest the ankle on a chair or bench to make the wrapping procedure easier. If tape will be used, it's advised to shave the hair from the bottom section of the leg and ankle.

Set up a practice call with your local 911 dispatcher.",How to Teach Your Kid How to Use 911," When your child learns to express himself in words and shows a desire to use the phone, it's the right time to explain the purpose of the number 911.;
, Explain to your child that 911 is the number to call to ask for help during an emergency. Luckily, it is a simple, short code that children can easily remember.

, Explain to your child what services they can reach when they call 911. For example:


Explain the role of a police officer. Tell the child that a police officer can help if they think that there is some threat to their safety, like someone breaking into the house, etc.
Explain the role of doctors/paramedics. Tell the child that doctor or paramedics can help if someone is seriously injured in an accident, if someone falls ill, passes out, etc.
Explain the role of a fireman. Tell your child that the firemen can come in case of a fire, a flood, or if someone needs to be rescued from an unsafe situation.

, Explain to the child who the dispatcher is. This is the person who receives the 911 calls from people who need help. The dispatcher asks questions, collects information, and sends help. Tell your child that they should not be afraid to talk to this person.

, The child needs to be made aware of the situations in which it's appropriate for them to make a 911 call. These situations include:


When the child sees a fire, smells smoke, or the fire alarm is activated.
If the child witnesses a crime, or believes that his or someone else's safety is endangered.
If the child was in an accident where people were injured, or if they are injured themselves.
If someone is sick and needs medical help, either on the street or at home.
If the child is lost and does not know where he is or how to contact his parents.

, However, it's also important to explain to your child the situations in which it is not appropriate to call 911. Explain to your child that the policemen, doctors and firemen are very busy people and do not have time to respond to calls that are not serious. Examples of non-serious situations might include:


If the child has an escaped pet.
If the child falls and scratches their knee.
If the child breaks or loses his bike.

, Let your child know that he or she should never call 911 out of boredom or for a joke. Explain that in some countries, this is even a criminal offense. Also explain that by calling 911 unnecessarily, they may be blocking the line for someone who really needs help.

, Explain to the child that 911 should be called from a safe location. Explain to your child that they must get away from any dangerous places and ensure that their life is not in danger before making the call.


For example, if there is a fire, the child should leave the house before calling. If they think that someone has broken into the house, they should try to get out and go to a neighbor's before calling.
However, there are also situations where the child should stay exactly where they are. For example, if someone is sick or injured, the child should stay with them. Let them know that the dispatcher who answers the 911 call can give them information on how to help the sick or injured person., Talk to your child about possible emergencies. Explain the possible situations in which a child should call 911. Encourage your child to name all these situations.


Ask questions such as: “What will you do when you see a car accident?” or “What would you do if you were alone at home, and see that mom is not well?” “What if your friend fell, hit his head and lost consciousness?""
This will help your child to recognize the specific situations in which they might need to call 911. This preparation could be vital when it comes to an actual emergency.

, The child must know their own address, name, last name, and parents’ names. Explain that this is because the dispatcher will ask him who is calling, what the emergency is and where it is located, in order to send help.


If someone in the family suffers from a chronic illness and has frequent problems, instruct the child to call 911 when they see certain symptoms. Write down the name of the disease or condition on a piece of paper and make sure the child knows where to find it.
In this way, the child will be able to provide this vital information to the dispatcher, which can be extremely helpful once the ambulance arrives.

, Teach your child how to describe their surroundings, in case the emergency happens outside of the home and the child doesn't know where they are.


Teach your child to look for stress signs or distinct characteristics of the buildings around them. This will help the dispatcher to send an ambulance/firetruck/police car to the correct location as quickly as possible., Instruct your child not to panic when they are making the 911 call. Explain that they need to talk to the dispatcher as slowly and calmly as possible.


Tell them to answer any questions that the dispatcher might have, in order to give as much information as possible.
Tell them to listen carefully to the dispatcher and to try to follow any instructions the dispatcher gives as closely as possible.

, If the child does not wait until the end of the call, they might miss out on providing or receiving vital information that could affect someone’s life.

, If your accidentally call 911, explain to them that they should not hang up. Tell them they should wait for the dispatcher to answer and then explain that there is no emergency.


Otherwise, the dispatcher may locate the call and send help where it is not needed, wasting resources and potentially delaying help to someone who really needs it.

, Have at least one telephone that the child can easily reach and access all times. It's no use teaching them how to call 911 if they can't get to a phone in case of emergency.

, Make sure your child knows how to use a cell phone and how to unlock it. Teach your child the password (if you have one) and show them how to get to the keyboard from the home screen.

, Older phones (such as those at grandma's and grandpa's house) may have a circular dialer. If this is the case, your should show your child how to call from such a phone.


A finger should be placed at the desired number and the dialer should be turned to the right, all the way to the end.

, Explain to the child that 911 means nine-one-one. Never refer to it as nine-hundred-and-eleven or nine-eleven. In a critical situation, the child may lose time if they expect the phone's keyboard to have the number eleven or ninety-one.


To younger children, explain the difference between the numbers 6 and 9. Point out that 9 has a circle which is above as its head, and that 6 has a circle at the bottom, like it's sitting on it.

, This is the best way for children to learn and the best way to assess the skills of your child Let the child wait for dial tone (you can act it out or play a recording tone from another phone to prepare the child for how the tone sounds)


Let the child act out calling 911. First the number 9, then 1, and then 1 again.
Act the part of the dispatcher. Ask questions like who's calling, where are you calling from and why.
Teach your child to speak loudly. Get them to repeat information if they didn't say it loudly enough and encourage them to ask you (the dispatcher) to explain again if they aren't clear on the instructions., You can make an appointment with a local dispatcher to do a practice call with your child. Call 911 and ask the dispatcher if he is free to practice with your child right now or if he need to make an appointment.

Compression aids in minimizing swelling, helps to reduce pain, and provides stability to restrict movement, allowing your injury to heal more effectively.Use an elastic bandage wrap to compress and support your wrist. Start your wrap at a point farthest from your heart.This is done to prevent swelling of the lower part of the extremity that can be caused by the wrapping process.Compression can help enable lymphatic and venous return to the heart.;
, Begin the first wrap around your fingers just below the knuckles, and covering your palm.Passing between your thumb and index finger, move the next few wraps around your wrist area, and continue to wrap your way towards the elbow. Wrapping the area from the hand to the elbow is recommended to provide the greatest stability, promote healing, and avoid additional injury to your wrist.Each wrap should cover 50% of the previous wrap., Once you have reached the elbow, continue to wrap moving back towards the hand area. This may require using more than one elastic bandage.


Include at least one more figure 8 pass, wrapping through the space between your thumb and index finger.

, Using the clips provided, or self-attaching ends, secure the end to a stable section of the wrap along the forearm area.


Check for warmth in the fingers to be sure the wrap is not too tight. Be sure the fingers can be wiggled, there are no areas of numbness, and that the wrap does not feel too tight. The wrap should be snug but not tight enough to cut off blood flow.

, Take the wrap off when it is time to ice the area.Do not sleep with the wrap on. For some injuries, your doctor may recommend some method of support for your wrist during the night. Follow the instructions provided by your doctor., It may take as long as four to six weeks for your injury to heal.


Keeping the wrist wrapped during this time can allow you to gradually resume your activities, provide support for your injury, and prevent further injury.The risk of swelling is reduced 72 hours following the injury. , A different method for wrapping your wrist may provide greater stability for the injured area and allow you to resume minor activity when you are ready.


Start your wrap by securing the elastic bandage wrap at an area just above the injury, meaning on the elbow side of the injured part of the wrist. Wrap the bandage around your forearm at this location two to three times.The next wrap should move across the injured area, and include several wraps around your forearm just below the injury, closer to your hand. This method provides added stability for the injured part of your wrist, which is now located between the two sections of the wrapped elastic bandage.Make at least two figure 8 passes between your thumb and index finger, securing each one with an additional wrap around your wrist area.Continue to wrap your wrist moving toward your elbow, covering 50% of the previous section with each wrap around your forearm.Reverse direction and wrap back in the direction of your hand.
Secure the ends of the elastic bandage with the clips provided, or by using the self-closure tab.
An injury to the wrist is best maintained if the wrap is extended from the finger or palm area to the elbow. This may require more than one elastic bandage wrap to properly wrap your injured wrist., Minor injuries involving wrists strains or sprains can be treated at home.A strain involves overstretching or pulling a muscle or the tendons that connect that muscle to bone.A sprain occurs when a ligament is overstretched or torn. Ligaments connect one bone to another bone.The symptoms of strains and sprains are very similar. You can expect the area to be painful, swollen, and have limited movement of the affected joint or muscle area.Bruising is more common with a sprain, as well as sometimes hearing a “pop” sound at the time of the injury. Strains involve muscle tissue, so muscle spasms can sometimes occur with a strain., Both strains and sprains respond well to this form of therapy.R I C E stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation., Try not to use your wrist as much as possible for several days to allow it to start healing. Rest is the most important step in the four areas defined as RICE.Resting your wrist means avoiding activities with the involved hand. Do not allow your wrist to do any work at all if possible.This means no lifting of items with that hand, no twisting of your wrist or your hand, and no bending your wrist. This may also mean no writing or computer work, depending on the severity of your wrist injury.To help your wrist to rest, you may want to consider purchasing a wrist splint. This is especially important if you have a tendon injury. A splint provides support for your wrist and helps immobilize it, to keep you from causing further injury. Wrist splints are available in most drug stores., Applying ice to the injured wrist, the cold temperature works its way through the exterior of the skin and into the deeper areas of soft tissue.The colder temperatures decrease blood flow to the area and help to minimize swelling and reduce inflammation in the area.Ice can be applied by using ice placed in a baggie, frozen veggies, or some other form of ice pack. Wrap the icepack, baggie, or frozen veggies in a cloth or towel, and avoid placing frozen objects directly on your skin.Apply the ice for 20 minutes at a time, then let the area warm to room temperature for 90 minutes. Repeat this process as often as possible, at least two to three times each day, for the first 72 hours after the injury., Compression helps to minimize swelling, provides light stability, and helps to prevent sudden movements that can be painful.Using an elastic bandage wrap, start at your fingers or hand area, and wrap your wrist. Progress towards your elbow. For the greatest stability and to promote healing, the area should be wrapped from the hand and fingers to the elbow.This is done to prevent swelling of the lower part of the extremity while it is being wrapped.Each subsequent wrap should cover 50% of the previous wrapped part of the elastic bandage.Check to be sure your wrap is not too tight and there are no areas of numbness.Take the wrap off when it is time to ice the area.Do not sleep with the wrap on. For some injuries, your doctor may recommend some method of support for your wrist during the night. Follow the instructions provided by your doctor., Elevating your wrist can help to reduce pain, swelling, and bruising.Keep your wrist elevated above the level of your heart when you are applying ice, prior to compression, and when you are resting., It may take as long as four to six weeks for your injury to heal. Keeping the wrist wrapped during this time can allow you to gradually resume your activities, provide support for your injury, and prevent further damage., Gradually work towards resuming your previous level of activity with your injured wrist.Mild discomfort in working to regain mobility or during reconditioning exercises is normal.Try taking NSAIDS such as tylenol, ibuprofen, or aspirin for pain as necessary.
Any activity that causes pain should be avoided and approached more gradually.Every person and injury is different. Expect your recovery time to be about four to six weeks., Wrapping the wrist to avoid a sports-related injury is most commonly done to prevent two common types of wrist injuries. These are known as hyperextension and hyperflexion.Hyperextension is the most common type of wrist injury. This occurs when your hand goes out to break your fall, and you land on your opened hand.This type of falling causes your wrist to bend further back to bear the weight and impact of the fall. This is called hyperextension of the wrist.Hyperflexion occurs when the outer part of your hand catches your weight as you fall. This causes your wrist to bend too far towards the inside of your arm, In some sports this injury is more common, and athletes often have their wrists wrapped to prevent a hyperextension injury or re-injury.The first step in wrapping a wrist to prevent hyperextension is to start with a pre-wrap.Pre-wrap is a type of lightly adhesive, rolled tape that is used to protect the skin from irritation that is sometimes caused by the stronger adhesives used in athletic and medical tape products.Pre-wrap, sometimes called underwrap, comes in a standard width of 2.75 inches and is available in different colors, and also in different textures. Some pre-wrap products are thicker or have a foam-like feel.Wrap the wrist with pre-wrap by starting about a third to half way between the wrist and the elbow.The pre-wrap should be snug but not too tight. Wrap the pre-wrap several times around the wrist area and up through the hand, passing between the thumb and index finger at least once. Continue back down to the wrist and forearm area, and wrap the pre-wrap several more times around the wrist and forearm., Using standard 1 and ½ inch athletic or medical tape, place several anchors around the pre-wrap to hold it in place.Anchors are pieces of tape that reach around the wrist with a few extra inches to secure the anchors.Begin securing the anchors in place by wrapping them around the pre-wrap starting closest to the elbow. Continue to place anchors over the pre-wrap along the area of the wrist and forearm.The section of pre-wrap that passes through the hand also needs to be anchored with a longer piece of tape that follows the same pattern as the pre-wrap., Using the standard 1 and ½ inch athletic or medical tape, begin closest to the elbow and wrap the wrist in a continuing motion with a solid piece of tape. Unroll more as you need it from the original roll of athletic or medical tape.Follow the same pattern as that used by the pre-wrap, including passing through the area between the thumb and index finger several times.Continue to wrap the wrist until all areas of pre-wrap, and all edges from the anchors, are covered well., A fan is the key part of the wrap that not only strengthens the wrap but provides stability in the position of the hand to prevent injury or re-injury.While it is called a fan, in reality the shape is more of a crisscross, similar to the shape of a bow tie. Start with a piece of tape that is long enough to reach from the palm of the hand, across the wrist area, and extend about one third of the way up the forearm.Lightly place the piece of tape on a clean, flat surface. Follow that piece with another piece the same length, crossing in the middle of the first, and at a slight angle.Continue with another piece of tape done the same way, but along the opposite side of the original piece as the first, and at the same slight angle. You should have something shaped like a bow tie.Place one more piece of tape directly over the very first piece. This gives added strength to your fan., Place one end of the fan in the palm of the hand area. Gently pull the hand into a slightly bent position. Secure the other end of the fan along the inside of the wrist area.The hand should not be bent too far inward. That would interfere with the ability to use the hand during the sporting activity. By securing the hand in a gently bent position, you are ensuring that the person can still use the hand, but it is taped securely to avoid hyperextension.Follow the taping of the fan with one final complete wrap of tape securing the fan in place., The wrapping technique to prevent hyperflexion follows the same steps as those for hyperextension, except for the placement of the fan.The fan is created in the same manner, creating a bow tie shape.The fan is then placed on the outer part of the hand, and the hand is gently pulled into a very slight angle that opens up the hand. Secure the other end of the fan, past the wrist area, and onto the taped part of the outside part of the forearm.Secure the fan in place in the same manner as preventing hyperextension, by wrapping the wrist again using a continued piece of tape. Be sure that all ends of the fan are securely taped down., In some cases, only a light wrapping may be needed.Apply one strip of pre-wrap around your hand along the area of your knuckles, passing between your thumb and index finger.Apply a second strip of pre-wrap just below your wrist area, on the elbow side of your wrist.Apply two pieces in a crisscross fashion to the outside of your hand, attaching the ends from one side of the crisscross to the pre-wrap that passes through your thumb and index finger, and the other end attached to the pre-wrap piece along your forearm.Copy the crisscross piece, and attach it in the same manner, but to the inside of your hand and inside part of your wrist and forearm.Using the pre-wrap material, wrap the wrist by starting at the forearm location with several passes around the wrist area. Follow this with a crisscross, or X-like pattern. Pass the pre-wrap through your thumb and index finger area then around your hand along your knuckles, and back down to the wrist area.Continue wrapping to provide the crisscross pattern on the inside and outside of your hand area, securing each pass to the wrist and forearm area.Follow this with anchors using standard 1 and ½ inch athletic or medical tape. Start at the forearm area and progress toward your hand area. Follow the same pattern used with the pre-wrap.Once the anchors are in place, begin wrapping with a continuous section of tape, following the pattern used with the pre-wrap.Be sure all areas of pre-wrap are covered as well as all loose ends of the anchors., A broken or fractured wrist requires immediate medical attention. If your wrist is broken, you may experience the following symptoms:Severe pain that gets worse when trying to grip or squeeze something.Swelling, stiffness, and difficulty moving your hand or your fingers.Tenderness and pain when applying pressure.Numbness in your hand.An obvious deformity involving your hand positioned at an angle that is not normal.With a severe break, the skin may be split open and bleeding, and protruding bone may be visible., A delay in seeking proper medical treatment for a broken wrist can impair healing.This can cause problems with your getting back your normal range of motion, as well as resuming the ability to properly grasp and hold objects.Your doctor will examine your wrist, and possibly do imaging tests like X-rays to see if there are any fractures or broken bones.

, The scaphoid bone is a boat-shaped bone located on the outside of other bones in your wrist, and closest to your thumb. There is no clear indication when this bone is broken. The wrist does not appear deformed and there is little swelling. Symptoms of a broken scaphoid bone include the following:Pain and tenderness to the touch.Difficulty gripping an object.A general improvement in pain after a few days, then return of the pain, felt as a dull ache.Severe pain and tenderness is felt when pressure is applied to tendons that are located between your thumb and hand.See a doctor for a diagnosis if you have these symptoms. You will need help from a healthcare professional since diagnosing a broken scaphoid bone is not always clearly evident., If your wrist is bleeding, extremely swollen, and if you are experiencing intense pain, you need to be seen by a medical professional as soon as possible.Other symptoms that warrant medical attention for your wrist injury include pain when trying to turn your wrist, move your hand, and move your fingers.You need to be examined immediately by a doctor if you are unable to move your wrist, hand, or fingers.If your injury is thought to be minor and you proceed with treatment at home, see a doctor if the pain and swelling lasts for more than a few days, or if symptoms begin to worsen., Calcium helps to build bone strength.Most people need at least 1000 mgs each day. For women, over age 50, the recommended dose of calcium is at least 1200 mgs daily., One of the major reasons for wrist injury is falling forward and catching yourself with your hand.To prevent falls, try to wear appropriate footwear and be sure your hallways and outdoor walkways are well lighted.Install handrails along outdoor steps or areas where the walkways are uneven.Consider installing handrails in the bathroom, and on both sides of stairways., If you spend your time typing at a computer keyboard, consider using an ergonomic keyboard or foam pads for the mouse that are designed to position your wrist in a more natural way.Take breaks often, and organize your desk area to allow your arms and wrist to rest in a relaxed and neutral position., If you participate in sports that require wrist action, be sure you wear the proper equipment to protect your wrist from injury.Many sports can lead to wrist injuries. Wearing the appropriate equipment, including wrist guards and wrist supports can minimize, and sometimes prevent, injury.Examples of sports that are commonly associated with wrist injuries include in-line skating, regular skating, snowboarding, skiing, gymnastics, tennis, football, bowling, and golf.

, Regular conditioning, stretching, and muscle strengthening activities can help you to develop your muscles to prevent injury.By working to develop proper muscle tone and conditioning, you can more safely participate in your sport of choice.Consider working with a sports trainer. To avoid injury, and especially to avoid re-injury, take steps to work with a trainer in order to properly develop your body and enjoy your sport while minimizing your risk of injury."

Wash your hands.,
Look to see if it has stopped bleeding.,
Apply pressure if it doesn't stop bleeding.,
Elevate the wound.",How to Stop Mild Bleeding During First Aid1," Before working on someone, it's important to wash your hands if possible. That way, you won't introduce infection to the wound. Also, put on medical gloves if they are available.Gloves will protect both you and the person you're caring for from bloodborne illnesses including HIV and viral hepatitis.
If gloves are not available, substitute plastic bags or some other impermeable material. You can also use many layers of clean cloth or another clean material. In this case, instead of putting pressure on the wound yourself, ask the injured person to to do so.Only use your bare hands if it is a serious, dire medical emergency. Don't risk your health!Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds in warm water with soap. Scrub them thoroughly.If soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based sanitizer can be used instead.;
, A minor cut by definition should stop bleeding on its own fairly quickly. The body's response is to clot the wound, and with a small cut, it should stop bleeding fairly quickly.Often abdominal and chest wounds are more serious than they look. You should always have these checked out by a professional.
Mild bleeding can be a serious situation if the person is on a blood thinner, or it is a puncture wound.
Mild bleeding should only affect the top layers of the skin. You should not be able to see organs underneath, for instance, and the wound should not be gushing or have a pulsating flow — these things indicate a medical emergency and you should call 991 immediately. Mild cuts should ""ooze,"" meaning bleed slowly., If it hasn't stopped bleeding in a minute or two, apply pressure to the wound. Place a clean cloth or sterile bandage over the cut. Hold it in place with your hand, applying steady and light pressure for a full 15 minutes. If the bandage soaks through, do not lift it up. Instead, apply an additional bandage on top of the first.Again, if you do not have gloves or some type of protective barrier on your hands, ask the person to apply pressure to her wound by holding the bandaging in place.

, If it still doesn't stop, try elevating the wound. Elevating the wound just means to get it above the person's heart. That way, blood has to travel against gravity to get to the wound. This lessens the amount of blood at the site, making it easier for the body to stop the bleeding.If you think the person may have a broken bone near the cut, you don't want to move that part of the body, as it can make the fracture and surrounding structure worse. You may need to skip this step if you think that's a possibility.If it simply won't stop bleeding, even if it's minor, call 911 or visit an emergency room.

Wash the wound.,
Use an antibiotic ointment.,
Cover the wound.,
Change the bandage daily.",How to Stop Mild Bleeding During First Aid2," Once you've stopped the bleeding, you need to wash out the wound. Use soap and water to clean it out, making sure to remove any dirt from the wound.This may be more easily done under running water or even in a shower.


If some of the dirt in the wound is stubborn, you can pluck it out with tweezers. Make sure to clean the tweezers with rubbing alcohol before using them so you don't introduce more bacteria.
If you can't get the wound completely clean, talk to your doctor., Use antibiotic ointment to lightly cover the wound. The idea is to keep the wound slightly moist. The point of the ointment is to help prevent infection., Once you've applied the ointment, it's time to cover it. You can use a regular adhesive bandage or simply sterile gauze and medical tape. Make sure the dressing covers the whole wound.If it's just a minor scrape, however, you can leave it uncovered. Covering it helps keep infection out., You should change the bandage at least once a day. In addition, you should change it if it's gotten wet or soiled. Therefore, if it's near your hands, you may need to change it frequently as you wash your hands throughout the day.As you change it, check on the cut. Once it's healed enough to be mostly scabbed over, you can leave the bandage off.
Watch for signs of infection, which include pus, redness, swelling, decreased mobility, and tenderness. The skin around the cut may also feel warm. Call your doctor if you suspect infection."

Clean your hands with rubbing alcohol.,
Treat wounds with rubbing alcohol.,
Disinfect skin before an injection.,
Disinfect medical tools.",How to Use Rubbing Alcohol1," Rubbing alcohol is a common ingredient in most commercial hand sanitizers. Hand sanitizer is used to disinfect the hands, and does not require soap or water. Simply rubbing hand sanitizer on the hands for approximately 30 seconds, or until the liquid has evaporated, kills the majority of bacteria present. Hand sanitizer often includes additional components, such as a moisturizing element to prevent the hands from drying out, but these components are not necessary. If you are unable to wash your hands with soap and water, or if you want to ensure that your hands are completely clean, rubbing alcohol may be used to disinfect the hands.Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol into the palm of one hand.
Rub the hands together vigorously for approximately 30 seconds, or until the hands are completely covered and the alcohol begins to evaporate.Note that rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer do not remove dirt from the hands. If your hands are visibly soiled, you may need to wash your hands with soap and water to remove the dirt from your skin.;
, One of the most common uses of rubbing alcohol is treating wounds. This is because rubbing alcohol makes an excellent antiseptic. It kills germs by coagulating each germ's protein. Once a germ's protein is solidified, the germ dies rather quickly.Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol on the skin surrounding a wound. This may be particularly helpful for puncture wounds, which can introduce foreign germs into the wound.Once the wound is clean, you can bandage the wound, and seek medical attention as needed.

, Certain medications, like insulin, need to be injected into the body. Prior to administering an injection, it's important to disinfect the skin to prevent bacteria from being introduced into the body.Pour 60% to 70% rubbing alcohol onto a clean cotton swab.Thoroughly wipe the skin where the injection will be administered. Do not go over the same area twice.Wait for the alcohol to completely dry before administering the injection., Some household medical tools, like tweezers, can harbor bacteria that could be introduced to a wound. For this reason, it's important to disinfect medical tools before use. You can do this with rubbing alcohol.Thoroughly douse the tips of tweezers in rubbing alcohol. Allow the alcohol to dry before use, to ensure that any bacteria on the tweezers have been killed."

Remove stains with rubbing alcohol.,
Clean your bathroom with rubbing alcohol.,
Make a window cleaner with rubbing alcohol.",How to Use Rubbing Alcohol2," Rubbing alcohol can make a surprisingly effective stain remover. Simply mix one part rubbing alcohol with two parts water. You can use this mixture in a spray bottle, or poured on a rag or towel to spot clean stained fabrics.Rubbing alcohol can be used to treat grass stains before the wash cycle. Apply the rubbing alcohol mixture to a stain, rubbing the fabric thoroughly. Let it sit for ten minutes, then wash the clothing article as you normally would., Because of its antiseptic properties, rubbing alcohol is often used to clean high-germ areas like bathrooms. Apply rubbing alcohol to a paper towel and rub bathroom fixtures like faucets, sinks, and toilets to quickly clean and disinfect these surfaces., In addition to its other cleaning applications, rubbing alcohol can be used to make an effective window cleaner. Just mix one pint of rubbing alcohol with two tablespoons of ammonia and two tablespoons of dish soap. Mix the formula thoroughly, then apply to windows using a spray bottle or sponge."

Remove a tick.,
Get rid of sneaker odors.,
Remove nail polish.,
Do not use rubbing alcohol to cool feverish skin.",How to Use Rubbing Alcohol3," Some people find that applying rubbing alcohol to a burrowed tick can shock the tick, making it easier to remove. Even if this does not work, experts recommend using rubbing alcohol to kill and preserve a tick after removal. This makes it easier for doctors to determine if the tick was a carrier of Lyme disease.Use a clean cotton swab to apply rubbing alcohol to the area where a tick is attached. If you don't have cotton swabs, you can pour a little rubbing alcohol directly onto the skin.Use clean tweezers (preferably after sterilizing them, which you can do with rubbing alcohol) to grip the tick's body as close to the surface of your skin as possible.Gently pull the tick upward without breaking any part of the tick's body.Drop the tick into a jar or bottle filled with a little rubbing alcohol. Be sure the tick is completely submerged.Use rubbing alcohol to cleanse the skin's surface where the tick was removed., Use a spray bottle to apply rubbing alcohol to the inside of sneakers. The rubbing alcohol will kill the bacteria causing the smells, leaving your sneakers clean and odor-free., If you're out of nail polish remover, you can use rubbing alcohol in a pinch. Pour some rubbing alcohol onto a cotton swab, and rub hard on your finger nails to remove old nail polish. Nail polish won't come off as easily as with actual nail polish remover, but it will still strip away the old nail polish., A common folk remedy for fevers is to apply rubbing alcohol to the skin. As the alcohol evaporates, it's thought to offer a cooling sensation.However, pouring rubbing alcohol on the body, especially on children, can be extremely dangerous. A number of children have actually slipped into comas after their parents applied rubbing alcohol to treat a fever. For this reason, using rubbing alcohol to relieve the symptoms of a fever is highly discouraged."

Identify the symptoms of a sprained thumb.,
Familiarize yourself with the most common causes of a sprained thumb.,
Understand why thumb wrapping is beneficial.",How to Wrap a Sprained Thumb," If you are at a competition or at school, there will typically be a medical professional there to help. Even though you might believe your thumb is only sprained, it might be a fracture or a dislocation. In some cases, the doctor will need to take an X-ray or MRI to determine how to treat your thumb., If your thumb is fractured or dislocated, do what the doctor has outlined for your treatment. If your thumb is sprained, the doctor will typically suggest purchasing a thumb brace or wrapping your sprained thumb. If you need to have your thumb wrapped they will be able to do it for you.

, If your thumb is painful (which it almost certainly will be), talk to your medical professional about which painkillers would be most helpful — if you should stick to over-the-counter treatment or if your doctor will prescribe you something stronger. Also ask for how long you should take them.

, Since you will now need to wrap your own thumb, hold the injured hand with the palm facing upward. Use a crepe bandage, or at most an ACE bandage (which can be purchased at a pharmacy), and scissors. Put the end of the bandage against the underside of the wrist of the injured hand, at the hollow where you would take your pulse. Then wrap the back of your hand and your pinkie finger with the other end of the bandage. Pull the bandage over the thumb using your uninjured hand.You can also try adhesive sports tape, but this may irritate the skin and make it harder to remove.

, Start by wrapping the wrist in a comfortable, not too tight loop, going around the wrist two times.Make sure you are not cutting off your circulation with the anchor. Your hand and/or fingers will tingle, feel cooler to the touch and start to turn blue if the wrap is too tight., Start with the end of the bandage at the inside of your wrist, at the hollow where you would take a pulse. From that point, wrap the bandage around the heel of your thumb and across the back of your hand and diagonally across toward the tip of your pinky finger.Wrap around all four fingers, then bring the bandage back behind the fingers and cross it diagonally along the back of the hand. The wrap should end at the side of the hand below the pinkie finger., Wrap the bandage around the wrist again and then make the same loop across the back of the hand to the pinky, around the fingers, and back down across the back of the hand again., Wrap the bandage around thumb and anchor it in place to the diagonal strip of bandage going across the back of your hand., Do not wrap it so tightly that it begins to cut off circulation. Move the bandage slightly up your thumb with each wrap, overlapping the bandage. The farther up your thumb you wrap, the greater the support.When the thumb is sufficiently wrapped, cross the bandage over the back of the hand and down to the wrist. You can cut off any excess wrap.

, You can do this by pinching the nail on your thumb for two seconds. Look at your nail immediately after you let go. If the nail becomes pink again after one or two seconds, then your thumb has good circulation.If it takes more than two seconds for your nail to turn pink again, bandage may be too tight. Unfortunately, the only way to fix this is to remove the bandage and try again.:


Numbness, tingling or a sense of pressure can also indicate the bandage is applied too tightly.

, Use medical tape to secure the end of the bandage at the wrist., The acronym RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation.Even though there is inconclusive evidence that RICE works as well as people believed in the past, many doctors still encourage it as a way to move toward recovery.Rest your thumb on a soft surface and do not try to use it for things, particularly physical activities that could injure it further.
Apply ice to your thumb to help reduce pain and swelling. Your ice pack can be a bag of ice or a bag of small frozen vegetables like peas. Make sure to wrap the ice pack in a cloth so that it does not rest directly against your skin. Hold the ice pack on your thumb for 10 – 20 minute intervals.
Compress the thumb with the wrapping.
Elevate your thumb for five seconds and then bring it back to its resting position. Repeat this process every hour or so.

, These four elements have been found to impair your ability to heal quickly. In some cases, they can make the sprain worse., Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be taken to relieve pain caused by a sprained thumb, but not within the first 48 hours. Early on, they might impede your recovery. They work to reduce inflammation caused by the sprain. Ibuprofen is one of the most common NSAIDs taken for a sprain.The recommended dose is 200 to 400 mg taken orally every four to six hours. Eat something when you take the ibuprofen to avoid getting an upset stomach.
You can also use NSAID gels, which you apply to the skin around where the pain is most severe. Massage the gel into your skin so that it is absorbed fully.

, Arnica is an herb that can help to reduce bruising and swelling caused by a thumb sprain. You can take arnica supplements to combat the swelling, or you can apply it directly to the painful area.Spread arnica cream, which you can purchase at your local pharmacy, over your sprained thumb.
Adding a drop or two of geranium or lavender essential oil to the arnica cream may help further reduce bruising.

, When you sprain your thumb, your thumb’s range of motion will most likely become restricted. In order to regain your range of motion, you will have to do some thumb exercises, such as the following:Rotate the thumb in circles.
Pick up small objects like marbles or pencils. Put a little pressure on your thumb as you squeeze the object. Repeat for five minutes.
Squeeze a small ball in one hand. Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat. Do two sets of 15 to help strengthen your grip.
Move your thumb away from the rest of your fingers. Keep it as far away from your fingers as you can for five seconds, and then return it back to its normal position.
Bend your thumb down towards your palm. Keep your thumb as close to your palm as you can for five seconds. After five seconds have passed, return it back to its normal position.
Move your thumb away from your palm. This action should be like you are doing a coin toss. Extend your thumb away from your palm for five seconds, then return it to its normal position.
Do not apply any external forces to the sprain until late into recovery, if at all. Allow your sprained thumb to do the work — don't pull it or hold it with your other hand.

, A healthy diet can help you to recover more quickly. In particular, repairing a sprained thumb requires protein and calcium. Try not to use your thumb while you eat to avoid further injury. For a balanced diet, eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and Omega fatty acids.Try to avoid fatty, starchy, or sugary foods.

, If you are not sure that you have actually sprained your thumb, it is helpful to know what symptoms to look for. These symptoms include:


Sharp, pulsating and/or excruciating pain
Swelling
Bruising

, While you can sprain your thumb in a variety of ways, the most common causes of a sprained thumb include:


Repetitive activities that involve the thumb and put excessive pressure on its joints.
Sports like basketball, volleyball, and other sports where there is a good chance that the ball will put a lot of pressure on your thumb
Contact sports like rugby and martial arts.

, Wrapping a sprained thumb does not only help stabilize the injured thumb, but also compresses it. Compression aids in stimulating the flow of lymph fluid, which carries important nutrients to the damaged tissues surrounding the injury. Lymph fluid also removes waste from cells and body tissues which is an important function during the tissue regeneration process. Wrapping the thumb also speeds the recovery process and keeps the injury from getting worse.


In order to be completely effective, the bandage must be removed, the injury left to rest, and the bandage re-applied a few times a day. In this way, the lymphatic system can complete its evacuation of the injury site.

If you have an injured foot, consider using crutches or a cane to take the pressure off the swollen area.
If you have a swollen arm caused by an injury, use the other arm to perform tasks, or ask for help from someone else.;
, Any time you are sitting or lying down, prop up the swollen area on pillows, above the level of your heart.This prevents blood from collecting in the swollen area and aids in circulation.


Use a sling to keep your arm elevated if necessary.
If the swelling is severe, make a point of sitting down and elevating the swollen body part for a few hours.

, High temperatures will make swelling worse, so do your swelling a favor by applying a cold compact. Avoid applying ice directly to the skin, but wrap an ice pack in a towel and apply to the swollen area. Do this for 15 minutes at a time, several times a day., Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are medications that decrease pain and swelling. The most common variants are ibuprofen (common brands include Motrin and Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). Note that acetaminophen (Tylenol) is not an NSAID and will not reduce swelling. Talk to your doctor about what the best medication for your situation may be.

, Although you do want to rest the swollen area, refraining from movement for extended periods reduces circulation and will eventually make your swelling worse. Get up and walk around occasionally during your regular work day, and include low impact exercise in your weekly routine. These may include yoga, swimming, and talking walks.


If you sit at a desk all day, try mixing it up by using a standing desk sometimes. If that's not an option, make a point of getting up to walk around the office every hour or so.
When you are sitting, change positions often and keep your feet slightly elevated whenever possible.

, High levels of sodium contribute to swelling, so avoid consuming foods with lots of sodium. In addition, drink lots of water to flush the salt from your system.To increase the cleansing property of your water, try adding cucumber and lemon slices - both natural anti-inflammatories.
Whenever possible, choose water over beverages that contain sodium. Even sweet beverages often have high levels of sodium.

, Tight clothing above your swollen areas can further restrict blood flow, which will worsen your swelling. Avoid wearing tight clothes (especially nylon stockings or garters), and try wearing supportive swelling stockings instead., If you suffer from a magnesium deficiency, your swelling may be worsened as a result. Purchase magnesium supplements from a local health foods store and take 250mg daily.

, The bubbles and quinine in tonic water can help to limit your swelling. Pour cold (or lukewarm, if you can’t handle cold) tonic water into a dish and soak your swollen areas for 15-20 minutes once daily.

, Epsom salts work as natural anti-inflammatories when dissolved in water. Add two tablespoons of plain epsom salt to your warm bathwater and allow it to dissolve. Do this daily for the best results.

, Rubbing the swollen area reduces swelling and increases blood flow. Either get a professional massage or give yourself a rub-down on the swollen area of your body. Use grapefruit essential oil to help the process. If you give yourself a massage, focus the pushing movement upwards rather than downwards on the swollen area., If using the above methods doesn't reduce your swelling within a few days, see a doctor to determine whether an underlying problem may be causing your body to swell.


Severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of pre-eclampsia, a serious condition that causes high blood pressure along with swelling.Certain medications can cause the body to swell up. Anti-depressants, hormone treatments, and blood pressure medication may lead to swelling.Heart failure, kidney failure, and liver failure cause fluid to collect in the body and lead to swelling., Swelling in conjunction with other symptoms could mean you are experiencing heart, kidney or liver problems, and you'll need to seek medical attention right away. See a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms:


You experience chest pain.You have shortness of breath.
You are pregnant and have a sudden increase in swelling.
You have a fever.
You have diagnosed heart or liver problems and notice swelling.
Your swollen body part is warm to the touch.

Keep the child calm.,
Stop the bleeding.,
Get some kind of cut disinfectant.,
After disinfecting, put on a sterile bandage.

,
Have the child rest.",How to Treat Your Child's Cuts and Scrapes," It won't help if you are running all over the house and saying you will have to call the doctor's office. Hold your child's hand, speak in a calm voice, and even if the cut is bad, never say he or she will need stitches or other drastic procedures unless you are absolutely sure it is necessary, because this will scare him or her.;
, Get a clean washcloth or paper towel and press firmly to the cut. Wait for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. To reduce swelling or pain, you can also wrap an ice pack around a washcloth and press it to the cut.

, You should only use neosporin if the cut is not open. You could also use hydrogen peroxide, which works very well, but this will be painful for the child.

,, Don't allow your child to run out and keep playing, unless it was just a minor scrape. If it is a bad cut, however, keep the child relaxed and rested for at least an hour with his or her injured body part elevated.

Focus on finding the shut off valve.,
Shut off the valve once you find it.,
Shut down the main water line at the street, if all else fails.",How to Turn Off Your Water in an Emergency," If you have a sudden water leak and need to shut off the water immediately, most homes will have a main shut off valve in the basement. Others without basements will usually have a main shutoff in the crawl-space or in a utility closet (usually near the furnace). Here is a quick list of where to look first and how to it shut down.


Basement. Look on the basement walls for the line coming in. At or near the floor there should be a shut off valve.
Crawl space. On the exterior of your home look for an access. Once found, remove the access door and observe inside with a flashlight. Most main shut off valves will be within reach, however; many aren't, so you may need to crawl inside to find it. This can be dangerous. So it's best to call a professional at this point. If you found it right inside the access, follow the instructions below for shutting off the water.
Utility closet: If you live in a flat and have a closet with the furnace and/or water heater in it, chances are the main water line is here too. Search this area and follow the instructions below for shutting off the water.;
,


With a regular round valve (like the valve outside for your hose), turn all the way to the right.
With a straight line valve (a straight metal valve), turn so the handle is no longer parallel with the water line.

, This is usually in your yard and will have a metal lid marked water (don't confuse this with the gas line main). Some are small around 6–7 inches (15.2–17.8 cm) in diameter and others are larger (around a foot). Most of these cannot be turned on/off by the general public. You must have a special tool to reach the shut off valve called a street key.


However; in an emergency, given there is no other alternative, you can check the access as some are easy to reach and can be turned off with a wrench. Just turn the valve so it's non parallel with the main line.
Also if you would like one, you can purchase a street key at your local hardware store and/or plumbing supply desk. This key will work on both your water and gas line mains.

Recognize the symptoms of a pericarditis attack.,
Get sufficient rest.,
Take an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever.,
Switch your position.,
Minimize your risk of pericarditis.,
See your doctor as soon as possible.,
Use colchicine.,
Take prednisone.,
Undergo surgery for pericarditis complications.",How to Treat Pericarditis," Most pericarditis attacks come on quickly and do not usually last long. The most common symptom is a sharp, stabbing chest pain that may be in the middle or left side of your chest. The pain may also be in one or both shoulders or feel like a heart attack. Being able to recognize symptoms of pericarditis can ensure that you get prompt care. Other symptoms of pericarditis include:Pain while lying down or breathing
Dull ache or pressure in the chest
Fever
Weakness
Trouble breathing
Heart palpitations
Coughing
Fatigue;
, Most mild cases of pericarditis go away with rest. If you suspect that you are having an attack of pericarditis, sit down until the pain eases. Avoid any strenuous activity until you feel better, which can prevent a further attack.Continue to rest if you have a fever that accompanies any pain. Go back to your regular activities only when you have no symptoms of pericarditis., If you have had bouts of pericarditis in the past, your doctor may suggest taking an OTC pain reliever. This can minimize pain and inflammation until the pericarditis subsides. Anti-inflammatory pain relievers such as aspirin and ibuprofen are most often used to ease the discomfort of pericarditis.Following dosing instructions given by your doctor or on the pain reliever’s label.

, Some people may find that certain positions make their pericarditis worse. If you are experiencing an attack, try sitting up and/or leaning forward, which may ease your pain.Recognize that lying down or deep breathing may make your pericarditis worse.

, In most cases, you can’t prevent pericarditis; however, you can minimize the risk of having another episode, experiencing complications or developing chronic pericarditis. You can do this by:Getting prompt treatment
Following your treatment plan
Getting ongoing medical care

, Only a doctor can diagnose pericarditis.If you have a prolonged bout of pericarditis that doesn’t respond to home treatment or you suspect you may have the condition, schedule an appointment with your doctor. Explain to the staff why you are calling so that they can accommodate you quickly.


Tell your doctor any symptoms you’ve had and what measures you have taken to ease them. Let the doctor know how the pain feels, where its located, and what makes it better or worse.
Answer any questions your doctor might have for you. These may include whether you’ve had a recent respiratory infection or flu-like illness, a heart attack or injury to your chest, or any other medical conditions.

, Your doctor may prescribe colchicine (Colcrys) if you have acute or recurrent pericarditis.Colchicine is a drug that minimizes inflammation throughout the body. It can reduce the length of pericarditis symptoms and decrease the risk of recurrence.Be aware that colchicine is not safe for people with liver or kidney disease. It is also not safe when taking certain medications. Your doctor will check to make sure you’re not taking anything that may react with colchicine.

, If your pain is especially severe, your doctor may prescribe you prednisone, which is a steroid medication.Your doctor may also have you take prednisone if you don’t respond to other treatments or your symptoms are recurrent., There are two serious complications that can develop as a result of pericarditis.Cardiac tamponade is a condition where fluid builds up around the heart.Constrictive pericarditis is chronic inflammation of the pericardium with thickening and scarring.Treatment for both of these conditions is surgery. If you have either, your doctor will suggest one of the following surgical procedures:Pericardiocentesis, a procedure that requires the insertion of a small needle or tube to remove excess fluid in the pericardium. This relieves pressure on your heart.Pericardiectomy, a procedure to remove the pericardium and any scarring you may have."

Ask your child if they feel any pain or heat in the injured area.,
Notice if there the injured area is swollen or looks bruised and red.,
Check if your child has difficulty moving their injured joint from side to side or front to back.,
Take your child to the nearest hospital or clinic if the injured area is numb.,
Assess the injured area.,
Avoid massaging or putting unnecessary pressure on the area.,
Apply a compression bandage to a sprained ankle.,
Apply a compression bandage to a sprained wrist.,
If the sprain is more serious, use splints and an elastic bandage to immobilize the sprain.,
Avoid applying heat to the injured area within the first 1-3 days.,
Wait at least 48 hours before applying a cold compress or ice to the sprained area.,
After 48 hours, apply a cold compress for 5 to 20 minutes or until the skin is numb.,
Elevate the injured area above their heart with pillows.,
Make sure your child rests the injured area.,
Get crutches for your child when they want to move or walk around.,
Encourage your child to gently move or stretch the injured site as they recover.,
Give your child an over-the-counter pain reliever.",How to Treat Sprains in Children," A sprain will involve ligament and tissue damage, so your child should feel pain. Heat in the injured area occurs because your child’s body will try to prevent infection by increasing the temperature of the injured area. Bacteria is less likely to thrive in higher temperatures.


If your child indicates to you they are experiencing sharp, aching or excruciating pain, take them to the nearest hospital or clinic. This might be a sign that the tissues or structures around the ligament are also damaged.Surgery may be required to fix this level of injury.;
, The sprain causes damage to the ligament and other adjacent structures, which leads to internal bleeding and a rush of blood to the injured area, resulting in swelling.


If your child has a sprain, there will be bruising or redness in the injured area for the next 12 to 24 hours and into the first week of having the injury. Bruising is a sign of internal bleeding.

, Due to swelling and pain, your child may have a limited range of motion in the injured area.


If your child cannot move the sprained joint at all, this may be a sign of severe nerve and tissue damage, and will require immediate medical attention. Bring your child to the nearest hospital or clinic., This can indicate the injured area is not getting enough blood and oxygen, and will require immediate medical attention., Make sure your child is not displaying any symptoms of a serious sprain that needs to be treated by a doctor at the hospital, such as intense pain.


If your child can tolerate the pain and the injured area is warm, reddish or pinkish in appearance, this means the injured site still has good blood flow and can be treated at home.If the sprained area does not improve within the first 48-72 hours, you need to take your child to the nearest hospital or doctor. Diagnostics and physical exams may reveal other, more serious joint problems.

, Massaging the area will promote increased blood flow to the site and worsen your child’s pain. It can also result in increased swelling in the area.

, To treat a sprained ankle, start wrapping at the base of your child’s toe. This will help fluids from their toes to move back to their heart and reduce the amount of swelling in the area.


Get a good base wrap at the toe so that the elastic bandage will not unravel.
After you covered the front and back parts of their foot, continue the wrap at top of their ankle and do a figure 8 wrap. Their heel and toes should be exposed.
Secure the wrap with a metal clasp.
Check your child’s toes for circulation. Re-wrap the area if their toes look blue or if they complain the wrap feels too tight.

, Compression will help to reduce swelling in the area. However, you need to make sure you wrap the elastic bandage so it is not too tight, as this will impede proper blood circulation.


To treat a sprained wrist, wrap an Ace bandage around your child’s forearm.
Take the tip of the Ace bandage and start wrapping from the base of their fingers all the way up to their forearm, stopping near the elbow.
Overlap the elastic bandage about one-half of the width of the first applied wrap.
Check the circulation of the wrapped area. If your child’s fingers look blue or they complain about numbness or tightness, restart the process until the wrap feels snug rather than too tight.

, Look for rigid materials like cardboard to make a splint and elastic material like a sock to wrap around the injured area.


To splint an ankle sprain, get three pieces of cardboard of equal size. Put one piece under your child’s foot, and one piece on either sides of your child’s ankle. Wrap the splint with the sock to secure it.
To splint a knee sprain, place a piece of cardboard on the back of your child’s knee. Make sure it is long enough so that your child’s leg cannot flex. Wrap the sock around the splint.
To splint a wrist sprain, place a piece of cardboard under their wrist. Make sure it is long enough so that their wrist does not flex. Using the sock, wrap starting from the palmar crease (single line across the palm) going up to your child’s forearm.To splint a shoulder sprain, get a big handkerchief and fold it triangularly to create a sling under the forearm of the injured shoulder. Tie both ends at the back of your child’s neck so that the movement of their shoulder is limited.

, Though a heat compress might feel relaxing for your child, it will just increase the swelling of the site and will only lead to more pain after the heat compress is removed.

, Avoid applying a cold compress to the sprained area right away, as this delay allows your child’s body to supply blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the injured area to facilitate healing.


If ice is applied to the injury during the first 24 hours, healing will be delayed as ice will constrict their blood vessels and limit blood flow to the area.A cold compress minimizes swelling by reducing blood flow to the injured area and numbing their nerve endings, which will lessen your child’s pain., Ask your child if they cannot feel anything on the sprained area with the cold compress applied. If this happens, remove the cold compress and reapply it every 2 to 4 hours daily until the swelling subsides.To apply a cold compress, wrap ice or an ice pack in a clean cloth and place it on the sprained area.Do not apply ice directly onto the sprained area as this can cause cold burns or skin damage from the extremely cold temperature.Avoid applying the cold compress close to bedtime or when your child is asleep. If you do so, remember to remove the compress after 20 minutes.

, This will help blood to return to their heart and improve blood circulation in the injured area. Increased blood flow is important because oxygen and nutrients will help your child’s sprain to heal properly.Your child can also place pillows under the sprained area to raise it while they are sleeping, reading, or watching TV.

, Depending on where the sprain occurs, resting does not mean your child will not be able to do other things. They can still perform other activities, but only if they do not put unnecessary pressure on the injury or cause a lot of movement using the injured area.


Your child should rest the sprained joint and not use it at all for the first 1 to 2 days. After this point, your child can use the sprained area, but not beyond when they feel pain in the sprained joint.
A sprain may last for 2-4 weeks, depending on the extent of injury. Thankfully, children’s ligaments generally heal faster compared to that of adults. This is due to the rapid growth and development of children at this stage.

, These will be especially useful if they have a sprained ankle or toe. If they put weight on the crutches for support, rather than on the sprained area, this will help the area to heal properly.

, This is necessary to prevent stiffness in the area.


While rest is important for faster recovery, gentle movement of the injured site can be done as early as the first day. Instruct your child to stop movement of the sprained area only if they experience any intolerable pain.

, One of the common over-the-counter pain relievers available at your local drugstore is Paracetamol or Acetaminophen. It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that stimulate the pain receptors to send pain signals to the brain.


The recommended dose of Paracetamol is based on your child’s weight. The dose should be 10 to 15 mg every kg of the child. So if your child’s weight is 30 kilograms, you need to multiply 30 by 10 or 15 mg. This means you will give your child 300 to 450 mg of Paracetamol. Give this dose every 4 to 6 hours.
This calculation can be used for children ages 2 to 12 years old.Keep in mind that pain relievers only treat the pain associated with sprain, not sprain itself. If the sprain isn’t serious, it will resolve on its own, with time and proper rest.

Watch the burn for signs of infection.",How to Treat Carpet Burns," The burn has damaged the skin, which is the body's first line of defense. Carpet burns and abrasions can become infected if bacteria gets inside them. If the wound does get infected, then;
, Wash it gently with a clean washcloth using warm water and antibacterial soap. Be sure to remove any visible dirt or debris. This helps to prevent any infection., You need to disinfect the wound to guard against infection. Use iodine, hydrogen peroxide, or an antiseptic if there are signs of dirt in the abrasion, or if any bleeding areas are deep. Soak a cotton ball in iodine, peroxide, or antiseptic and carefully dab it on the burn. All of these products may cause some pain when you apply them.


Alcohol can inflict pain and cause harm, so avoid using it.

, Smear some Neosporin or other ointment on the carpet burn.


Check the burn for any deeper damage, like cuts or lacerations. These might need medical attention if they are serious.

, Cover the area loosely with a bandage. Remove the bandage and check the burn in 24 hours. If the surface of the skin has started to scab or form a crust, the burn will heal best if left uncovered and exposed to the air. Put a fresh bandage back on for another 24 hours if the skin is still red and raw and crusting has not started yet.

, If the burn is hot and painful, try running some cool water over the injured area. Try running cool water over the carpet burn for five to 10 minutes every hour or two.Do not apply ice or butter to a burn., Fabrics can irritate the burn. If you have to wear clothes over the burn, cover it with gauze or a bandage first., Try to keep the burn free from moisture. Moisture encourages bacteria to breed. Dry the skin with a cotton ball if it becomes wet.If the rug burn is oozing, don't wipe it away and further irritate the burn. Instead, remove the gauze or bandage and allow the wound to air dry.If the burn is oozing pus or blood, see a doctor immediately.

, Apply some aloe onto the burn to help speed up the healing process. Aloe comes in many forms: spray, gel, liquid, lotion, and cream. You can also get aloe directly from the plant, which is the strongest form. Just cut off a small portion and squeeze the inside gel onto the burn.

, Spread some honey over the carpet burn. This can provide relief from itching and help speed up healing., Crush some marigold flowers and parsley leaves and mix them together to make a paste. Spread the paste over the wound to help heal the burn., Turmeric has been proven to stimulate skin regeneration and clean wounds. Mixing 1/4 of a teaspoon (1 ml) of turmeric powder with one teaspoon (5 ml) of cocoa butter. Apply the paste to the area three times a day.

, Different essential oils can help the healing process. Lavender is known to help healing with its regenerative and antiseptic properties. It can also help relieve the pain. Thyme also has regenerative and antiseptic properties.


Apply two to three drops of essential oil to gauze and press it to the burn. Change the gauze two to three times a day.
You can also clean the wound with five or six drops of essential oil diluted in a cup of water.

, Some products can cause further harm to the carpet burn. You should avoid lotions, powders, oils, sunscreen, and alcohol on the carpet burn., Increasing your vitamins can help boost your healing. Up your intake of vitamin C to boost your immune system and protect you from bacteria. Eat more citrus fruit, strawberries, broccoli, and tomatoes. Take a daily vitamin C supplement if your diet is lacking.


Eat more foods high in vitamin E. These foods include milk, eggs, whole grains, spinach, and asparagus. Vitamin E is high in antioxidants, which helps the body heal., If you develop any signs of infection, or the wound doesn't heal, see your doctor. Signs include increased redness and tenderness, pus seeping from the wound, a red rash developing that spreads up from the wound, tenderness in the armpits or groin, or fever.

, Once the person is no longer in contact with the electrical current, try not to move him or her unless completely necessary., The victim may be unconscious or otherwise unresponsive to touch or when spoken to. If the person is not breathing, perform rescue breathing and CPR., Electrical burns can have an effect on the electrical activity of the heart.Call 911 or another emergency response number, especially if the person is unresponsive or if the burn is from a high-voltage wire or from a lightning strike.If the heart has stopped, you will need to administer CPR.
Even if the victim is conscious, you should call 911 if he or she has severe burns, a fast heartbeat, heart arrhythmia/cardiac arrest, a seizure, problems walking or keeping balance, trouble seeing or hearing, red or reddish black urine, confusion, muscle pain and contractions, or difficulty breathing.Be aware that the person may also have kidney damage or damage to the nervous system or bones.

,


Cover the burns with a dry, sterile gauze bandage.For severe burns, do not attempt to remove pieces of clothing that have stuck to the skin. However, you can cut away loose clothing near the area of the burn, especially if the clothing encircles the area and can become problematic if the area swells.
Do not use a blanket or towel to cover the burns because the loose fibers can stick to the burn surface.Do not attempt to cool the burns with water or ice.
Do not apply grease or oil to the burns.

, He may be cold, have clammy skin, a pale appearance, and/or a rapid pulse. Track any of these symptoms to tell the emergency responders when they arrive.

, Try to prevent the injured person from becoming chilled, which can worsen the shock symptoms. If using a blanket, keep it off the affected areas while waiting for paramedics to arrive., Depending on the severity of the shock and the burns, the ER doctor and nursing team will have a wide variety of possible tests and treatment options.


They will likely order blood and urine tests to check for damage to your muscles, heart, and other organs.An ECG (or EKG) will record the electrical activity in your heart to ensure that the shock hasn’t caused any arrhythmia.For serious burns, medical staff may take a scintigraphy, which helps find dead tissue that may need to be removed., The doctor is likely to prescribe medication for pain management as burns can be painful while healing. You will likely receive a prescription for antibiotic creams or ointments as well to apply as directed when changing bandages on the affected area., The prescribed treatment will likely include antibiotics in order to keep the burns from becoming infected. However, you should still watch for signs of infection and see your doctor immediately if you believe the wound has gotten infected. Your doctor will prescribe a more aggressive antibiotic if this is the case. Potential signs include:Change in color of the burnt area or surrounding skin
Purplish discoloration, particularly if swelling is also present
Change in thickness of the burn (the burn suddenly extends deep into the skin)
Greenish discharge or pus
Fever

, Any time the bandages become wet or soiled, change them. Clean the burn (using clean or gloved hands) with water and a mild soap, apply more antibiotic ointment (if instructed to do so by your doctor), and rewrap with a new, sterile piece of nonstick gauze.

, For severe third-degree burns, doctors may recommend a number of surgical options depending upon the size and location of the burn. Some of these options include:Debridement or the removal of dead or highly damaged tissue to prevent infection, inflammation, and to improve healing time
Skin grafts or flaps, which is the process for replacing lost skin with healthy skin from other sites to help assist in healing and prevent infection.
Escharotomy, which is an incision made in dead tissue to the fat layers below and can improve blood flow as well as relieving pain from pressure caused by swelling.
Fasciotomy, or the release of pressure caused by swollen muscles associated with the burn, which can help decrease damage to nerves, tissue, or organs.

, Potential muscle and joint damage associated with severe burns can lead to decreased function. By seeing a physical therapist, you can rebuild strength in the affected areas, increasing mobility and decreasing pain associated with certain movements."

Use a tourniquet only if you have proper training.,
Keep calm.,
Get the injured person proper medical attention.",How to Treat Severe Bleeding During First Aid," Call for emergency medical help or ask someone else nearby to do it while you begin caring for the injured person. Do this as soon as possible, so that help will quickly arrive. This is the key to survival for a severely injured person.


If you suspect the person has injuries that are causing internal bleeding, let medical help know when you call. There might be internal bleeding if you notice the person coughing up blood, vomiting, or bleeding from the ears, eyes, nose, or mouth. Any sudden bruising along with swelling of the back, abdomen, or an arm or leg are also further signs of internal bleeding.;
, ABCDE stands for Airways, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure/Environment and serves as a reminder of the order in which you should evaluate the trauma of the injured person.Knowing the source of the trauma will help in deciding how to proceed with first aid as well as inform emergency personnel, such as 911 operators, to address the problem more accurately.


Airways: Check for obstructions to the injured person's airways. Is there a foreign object in the way? Are there external or internal fractures preventing airflow?

Breathing: Check if they are breathing. Is their chest rising and falling? Do they need additional oxygen?

Circulation: Check that the injured person has adequate blood circulation. Do they have a pulse? Are they conscious?

Disability: Check for signs of brain trauma. Are they conscious? Are their pupils dilated?

Exposure/Environment: Check to see if they are injured elsewhere or at further risk. Are they protected from cold or hot? Are they restricted by their own clothes or dangerous elements?

, Do not move the injured person if you do not have to. However, if there is immediate danger of other injury (from traffic, falling objects, etc.), try to form a barrier, keeping the injured person and others safe, such as by directing traffic around an accident site. If you absolutely must move the injured person yourself, immobilize the wound site as best you can.

, If you can, you'll want to sanitize your hands by washing them with soap and water. Put on surgical gloves as well, if they're available. This will not only protect you from the risk of getting diseases, but also prevent the injured person from becoming infected.


Always be careful when handling someone else's blood. Since blood can carry disease-causing pathogens, take steps to wash your hands and protect yourself.Never re-use plastic or surgical gloves, since doing so can spread infection.
If you do not have disposable gloves, try using something like plastic wrap to put a barrier between your hands and the wound., If there is obvious dirt or debris in the wound, remove it if possible.However, do not try to remove large objects, or ones deeply embedded in the wound, since this can make bleeding worse. If you must leave an object in the wound, avoid pressing on it, as this may push it deeper into the wound.

, Use a sterile or clean cloth, bandage, or gauze and apply firm pressure directly on the site of the bleeding. Use your hands only if you have nothing else.Do not put pressure on an eye wound, or if there is an object embedded in the wound.


Keep applying pressure without removing the cloth to check on the bleeding. If you take the bandage off, you could disturb clots that are forming to stop the bleeding., You can fix the bandage in place with tape, gauze strips or whatever you have on hand, like a necktie or strip of cloth. Take care not to tie the strips too tightly, or you could cut off circulation.

, If a bone does not appear to be broken, raise the wound site so that it is above the heart.For instance, if a leg is injured, raise it on a chair or place a pillow under it. Elevating the wound can keep blood from rushing to it and intensifying the bleeding.

, There are two major pressure points on the body; choose the one nearest the site of the wound.


If the bleeding is near a leg, press and hold against the femoral artery in the groin, where the leg bends at the hip.
If the bleeding is near an arm, press and hold against the brachial artery, along the inside of the upper arm.

, Cover the injured person with a blanket or similar material to keep in body heat. Resting the injured person can help prevent him or her from going into shock., Don't remove the cloth covering the wound even if it soaks through with blood, as this can make the bleeding worse. You can place another layer of cloth or bandage over the soaked one. The important thing is to keep applying pressure., If bleeding does not stop, even after prolonged pressure, you may need to make a tourniquet. Because there are severe dangers from incorrectly placing or applying a tourniquet, you should only use one if you've been trained to do so.An easy-to-use combat tourniquet is now available for civilian purchase. If you can get one, buy a Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) and learn how to use it.When paramedics or other help arrives, let them know how long the tourniquet has been in place.

, Dealing with severe bleeding can be shocking and stressful. While you wait for medical help to arrive, calm yourself by focusing on the steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Calm the injured person by talking to him or her, and giving assurance that help is on the way.

, If you're waiting for an ambulance, continue to stay with the injured person. Keep applying pressure to the wound. Or, if the bleeding has stopped and help is not on the way, try to get the injured person to the emergency room as quickly as you can.Remember, if you must move the injured person yourself, immobilize the wound site. If possible, wait until after the bleeding has stopped to move the person.
Don't remove any bandages before taking the person to the emergency room.Removing them could cause bleeding to restart.
If the person is alert, ask about any medicine they are taking or any known medical problems, also any known drug allergies. This can keep them distracted while you wait for help and is important information you can then pass on to medical professionals.

Call for emergency services immediately.,
Ask the injured person how he was injured.,
Determine where the open wound is and if bone is protruding from the skin.,
Do not remove any foreign object penetrating the body.,
Determine if there are other life-threatening injuries to the body.",How to Treat an Open Fracture During First Aid1," An open fracture has a high rate of infection and the possibility of other serious bodily trauma. The quicker you get medical care, the less chance of the wound becoming infected.Call 911 or assign a specific person to make the call while you begin treatment.;
, If you didn’t see the accident happen, you’ll want to get a quick history from the person as soon as possible. Do this while you’re gathering what you need to treat the wound and calling emergency services. Depending upon how much blood is lost, or if the person becomes unconscious, you may be the one telling emergency personnel how the accident happened. Emergency personnel will want to know:


How the bone was broken: from a fall, car accident, blow, during a sporting event?
What the wound looked like immediately after the accident and if it continued to get larger?
How much blood was lost?
If the person required treatment for shock?

, This does not mean you should touch the wound; just look at it. If the open wound is caused by a penetrating foreign object or if the wound is caused by the sharp edges of bone opening the skin, the treatment can be different. Severity of the wound is variable. There may only be a small opening in the skin without visible bone or the wound may contain an area of bone that is quite large.


Bone is off-white in color and not necessarily the stark white color found in skeleton models. It is ivory in color, like an elephant's tusk or a tooth.

, A penetrating wound may have pierced an artery. If you remove the object, the artery may begin to bleed profusely and the person may quickly bleed out and die. Instead, treat the area with the foreign object in place, taking care not to touch or move the object., Because of the amount of force needed for an open fracture, there is a 40 to 70% chance of other serious trauma to the body which may be life-threatening. This could include profuse bleeding from the wound.

Remove clothing or jewelry at the site of the burn.,
Rinse the burned area under cool water until the pain stops.,
Wash your hands.,
Do not break any blisters.,
Wash the burn site.,
Pat the area dry.,
Apply an antibiotic ointment.,
Apply a bandage.,
Take over-the-counter pain relievers.,
Consider contacting your doctor.,
Watch for signs of infection.,
Have a doctor look at large blisters.,
Change the bandages often.",How to Treat Electrical Burns2," Even minor burns can produce some uncomfortable swelling, so immediately remove any clothing or jewelry near the burn that can make the site even more uncomfortable.If clothing is stuck to the burn, then this is not a minor burn, and you should seek immediate medical care. Do not try to remove clothing stuck to a burn. Instead, cut around the stuck portion to remove only the loose areas., The cool water will lower the skin temperature and can even potentially stop the burn from becoming more serious. Hold the burned area under cold, running water, or soak it for about 10 minutes. Don’t panic if the cool water doesn’t immediately stop the pain: it can take up to thirty minutes.Do not ever use ice or ice water because the colder temperature can lead to additional tissue damage.You can place arms, hands, feet, and legs into a basin of cool water, but you should use a cool compress for burns to the face or body., You will need to clean the burn to reduce the risk of infection. However, it’s very important to thoroughly wash your hands before handling the burn at all because any open blisters can easily become infected.This also includes using only clean cloths, gauze, gloves, or anything else you might use when handling the burn.

, Burn blisters are not like minor friction blisters, where breaking them can help reduce pain. Do not break any blisters associated with the burn; doing so can greatly increase the potential for infection., Use a cold soap and cool water to clean the burned area.Lather the soap gently so as not to risk breaking any blisters or irritating the skin.


Some of the burned skin might come off as you wash the area., Use only a clean cloth to pat the area dry. Do not scrub at the area with the cloth. Sterile gauze is an even better option if you have it available.


For extremely minor first-degree burns, this may be all the care you need to provide to the area.

, You can use ointments such as Bacitracin or Polysporin each time you clean the burn.Do not put sprays or butter on burns because they trap heat inside the burn.

, Loosely cover the burned skin with a clean bandage. Change the bandage every time it gets wet or soiled in order to avoid infection.Avoid wrapping the area too tightly, or you might risk doing further damage to the burn.


If the burned skin or blisters have not broken open, then the area may not require a bandage. However, wrap the area regardless if it’s in a location prone to getting dirty or that could become irritated by clothing.Do not tape a bandage so that it circles a hand, arm, or leg. This can cause swelling., Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help soothe minor pain symptoms. Take only as directed.

, Even with electrical burns that appear to be minor, you can develop symptoms that warrant a trip to your doctor. Contact your caregiver if you:Feel dizzy or weak
Have stiff joints or muscle pain
Experience confusion or memory loss
Have questions or concerns about your condition or care

, Infection is a minor risk for first-degree burns. However, you should always keep an eye on the burn and watch for signs of infection, especially when any blisters or broken skin are present. See your doctor immediately for prescription antibiotics if you believe your burn is infected. Potential signs include:Change in color of the burnt area or surrounding skin
Purplish discoloration, particularly if swelling is also present
Change in thickness of the burn (the burn suddenly extends deep into the skin)
Greenish discharge or pus
Fever

, If any large blisters develop from your burn, you should have them removed by a doctor. They will rarely remain intact, and it’s better to have a doctor remove them taking all of the necessary, sterile precautions.A large blister is roughly anything larger than your pinky fingernail., Any time the bandages become wet or soiled, change them. Clean the burn (using clean hands or gloves) with water and a mild soap, apply more antibiotic ointment, and rewrap with a new, sterile piece of nonstick gauze.

"
"
Assess the situation.,
Take a photo of the wound.,
Cover the wound with a sterile dressing and control the bleeding.,
Create a temporary splint from solid material in the area.,
Evaluate and treat for shock.",How to Treat an Open Fracture During First Aid2," Emergency services may not be immediately available if a person is injured on a hiking accident. Emergency personnel may arrive more quickly in a populated area, but it is just as important to apply first aid.


If you have access to a first aid kit or gloves, make sure you put them on to protect yourself from any blood-borne diseases.

, Use your phone or digital camera to take a photo of the area before moving forward with first aid. Providing an image of the wound for emergency personnel means you may reduce the exposure of the wound to air, as they will have to open the dressings to see the wound.

, If you have sterile dressings available use them to cover the wound and apply pressure to stop the bleeding around the bone. However, if sterile dressings are not available, you may have access to feminine protection pads or urinary incontinence pads. These are cleaner than material found in the vicinity of the accident and will reduce the risk of infection. If these are not available, use white material first, such as a shirt or bedsheets. If all else fails, just use the cleanest material possible.

, Support the area to reduce pain and discomfort for the individual using soft towels, pillows, clothing or blankets.This will help to reduce the potential for shock. If there is nothing available, do not move the person or injured area and wait for emergency personnel to splint the area.

, The force of the injury and extent of the trauma may cause the individual to go into shock. This can be life-threatening. Signs of shock include: feeling faint, breathing in short rapids breaths, cold and clammy skin, blue lips, rapid but weak pulse, and anxiety.Try to place the individual’s head lower than his trunk. The legs may also be elevated only if they are not injured.Make the person as comfortable as possible. Wrap her in a blanket jacket, or anything available to keep her warm.
Check the person's vital signs. Make sure her pulse and breathing continue to be normal.

"
"
Tell emergency personnel what they want to know.,
Expect prophylactic treatments, which means that the doctor will try to prevent infection.,
Expect surgical treatment.,
Expect possible complications from the injury.Individuals who experience an open fracture are at risk for complications from wound infection, tetanus infection, neurovascular injuries, and compartment syndrome.",How to Treat an Open Fracture During First Aid3," The physician in the emergency room will ask for information surrounding the accident, past medical history and any medications the patient may already be taking. Although most open fractures are more obvious, if there is a wound in the area of the fracture, the physician will assume there is an open fracture., Before setting the bone or closing the wound, the doctor will start antibiotics and assess whether the patient needs a tetanus booster. If the patient has not had a tetanus booster within five years, one will be given.These measures are used to reduce the risk of infection and promote healing.


The doctor will start IV antibiotics to cover a broad spectrum of bacteria. Each type of bacteria is susceptible to different types of antibiotics. This method of delivery bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and delivers the medication to the cells more quickly.
If the person does not remember when his last tetanus shot was, the doctor will err on the side of the caution and administer a shot. Although not painful when injected, a tetanus shot will be sore for up to three days.

, The standard medical treatment of an open fracture is surgery. From cleaning the wound in the operating room to stabilizing the bone and closing the area, the goal is to reduce infection, improve the potential for healing, and promote the functional restoration of the bone and surround joints.Once in the operating room, the surgeon will use antibiotic solutions and saline to clean the wound of debris, pull out badly torn tissue and get the area ready to be stabilized and closed.
The broken bone will be aligned with plates and screws used to stabilize the bone while it heals.
The area will usually be closed with sutures or with staples if the area is in a large muscle group. These will need to be removed once the wound has healed.
A cast or splint may be applied to stabilize the area. The cast may be removable so the wound can be attended or the area may be left open to air and an external stabilization device put in place. An external device uses pins through the leg attached to long stable bars on the outside to keep the area stable. The patient will not be allowed to use the joint below or above the break while the external stabilizer is in place.

, Infections can lead to a non-union of the fracture, meaning that the bones won’t heal together. This can lead to an infection in the bone and possible amputation.


Infection rates vary. An open tibial (leg bone) fracture has the highest rate of infection, sometimes between 25 - 50%, which significantly affects healing and restoration of function.Infection can be as high as 20% in other severe cases. However, the shorter the amount of time between the injury and medical care, the less likely you are to experience infections."
"
Stop the bleeding.,
Clean the wound.,
Apply an antibiotic.,
Determine whether to use a bandage.,
Cover the wound.,
Cover large scrapes and scratches with an occlusive or semi-occlusive bandage.,
Change the bandages once a day.,
Leave the wound uncovered once it has formed a scab.,
Recognize immediately dangerous wounds.,
Be aware of dangerous developments, including potential infection.,
Make sure tetanus shots are up to date.",How to Treat Small Cuts or Scratches," Even before cleaning a cut or scrape, make sure you’re able to stop the bleeding. Surface-level cuts and scratches will stop bleeding on their own after a few minutes. To help slow bleeding, apply pressure with a soft, clean material.Bleeding helps clean wounds, so don’t be distressed by a bit of blood.
Apply firm but gentle pressure to the wound with a clean cloth, tissue or piece of gauze. If the blood soaks through, use more of whatever materials you’re using. Maintain pressure for 20 minutes.Areas rich in blood vessels — such as all of your head — may bleed more than expected.
Raise a wounded arm or leg above your heart to slow the bleeding.;
, Rinse the wound with clean water and wash around the wound with soap and water to reduce the risk of infection.Take care not to get soap into the wound itself.
Remove any persistent dirt or debris with tweezers that have been cleaned with alcohol.
You do not need to use hydrogen peroxide or iodine for most minor cuts and scrapes. Consider using hydrogen peroxide only if the wound was exposed to a potential source of contaminant, such as unclean water.

, Instead of using potentially harmful chemicals to clean the wound, use a safer method of preventing infection by coating the wound in an antibiotic cream or ointment, such as Neosporin.Cover the entire wound in a thin layer.
Know that antibiotic application will not make the wound heal faster; it will only help prevent infection by keeping the wound clean and moist.
If a rash develops after antibiotic application, discontinue use immediately.
Know that antibiotics are not a vital step in the treatment of minor cuts and scrapes. Most will heal without, though protection from both bandages and antibiotics can help prevent scarring., If the wound is on your hand or somewhere else that may allow it get dirty or be irritated by daily activities, you’ll want to cover it. If the wound is in a location that will not get dirty or be rubbed by clothing, you may not want to cover it.
Leaving a wound uncovered will allow it to dry and heal quickly. If the cut or scrape is very small and shallow — and especially if it closes on its own after cleaning — leave it uncovered.

, Bandages are worth using if necessary to keep the wound clean by preventing bacteria or irritation of the wounded tissue.Use an adhesive strip or sterile gauze fastened with adhesive tape.
Use butterfly tape or another thin, flexible type of adhesive tape to cover wounds in areas where it is difficult to attach bandages, such as hands and feet.
All sorts of bandages and adhesion materials are readily available at pharmacies and corner drug stores.

, If you have a scrape or scratch covering a large area of your body, use a bandage designed to help such wounds heal faster and reduce scarring. Occlusive bandages of different types are available at most pharmacies., If a bandage becomes wet or dirty, change it as soon as it is convenient to do so. Always use entirely new materials, including both bandages and adhesion materials, when changing your bandages.If the adhesive tape or strips are bothering the skin around the wound, switch the type of bandaging you’re using.
Sterile gauze with an elastic bandage or paper tape are especially gentle options.

, Once the risk of infection or irritation is diminished by the formation of a scab, you no longer need to use bandages.Think of scabs as the body bandaging itself. Leave them alone and fight the urge to pick at them, as doing so reopens the wound and increases the risk of infection.Protect healing wounds from the sun. Exposure to direct sunlight will increase the likelihood of visible scarring.
Use clothing, bandages, or even sunscreen — if the would is mostly healed — for protection.

, Get to a hospital if the wound is jagged, has gaping edges, or cannot be cleaned. There are other serious conditions to watch for, as well.Go to the hospital immediately if the wound bleeds in spurts or bleeding continues after 20 minutes of continuous pressure.
Get to the hospital if the wound is deep, you can see any fat or muscle, or if you cannot easily and completely close the wound.It may need stitches.
The sooner a wound is properly closed, the less likelihood of infection and better the chances that there will not be serious scarring.
If the wound becomes more tender or inflamed, or begins to drain a thick or whitish-grey fluid, see a doctor soon.

, There are a few things you should watch out for. If any of the following occur, see a doctor:Numbness develops around the wound.
The victim’s temperature rises above 100.4°F (38°C).
Discomfort accompanies simple movements.
Red or otherwise discolored streaks develop near the wound.
The wound isn’t healing, begins to swell, or increases in warmth or drainage.

, Check to see if the victim is up to date with their tetanus immunizations. Especially if the wound is deep or dirty, and the victim hasn’t had a tetanus shot in the previous five years, a tetanus booster shot is a good idea."

Check for breathing.,
Have someone call 911.,
Look for an obvious obstruction.,
Attempt to clear the airway if the baby is conscious.,
Perform chest compressions.,
Check the infant’s airway.,
Perform rescue breathing if you are trained and comfortable doing so.,
Call 911 if you’re by yourself.,
Repeat CPR cycles.",How to Treat an Unconscious Choking Adult or Child1," If the choking infant (younger than one year old) has become unresponsive, you should first assess the situation.Quickly look around for food, toys, or whatever else may have caused the choking. Then check to see if the choking infant is showing any signs of breathing—chest rising or hearing breathing when you place your ear close to the infant’s nose and mouth.;
, If someone other than you is around, have that person call 911 while you begin taking first aid steps for the infant. Note that if you’re the only person around and the baby isn’t breathing at all, you should begin CPR before calling 911 to first ensure that the baby receives circulation and oxygen.If you’re the only person around, but others are within earshot, then proceed through the next steps while periodically yelling for help. Ideally, someone else will be able to call 911 as you attend to the baby.

, With the infant laying flat, tilt the baby’s head back and open his mouth. If you can see the object, remove it, but only if the object is easily removed. If the object is lodged, you don’t want to risk pushing it farther into the infant’s throat., If the baby is unconscious or shows no signs of breathing, skip to the next step. This step should only be taken if the infant is conscious; if the infant is unconscious, begin CPR immediately. If the unresponsive infant shows signs of reduced breathing, then you want to attempt to clear the infant’s airway. Try the following methods:Sit, rest your forearm on your thigh, and place the infant facedown along the length of your forearm. The baby’s head should be angled slightly downward as well. Use the heel of your hand to thump the middle of the infant’s back five times with firm but not violent thumps. Watch to see if the object dislodges.
Roll the infant face up onto your forearm—again with the head lower than the torso. Place two fingers along the center of the baby’s breastbone and quickly compress the chest five times. Check the mouth again to see if the action dislodged the object.
Repeat steps attempting to dislodge the object as long as the infant shows signs of breathing and a pulse. If the object dislodges and the baby resumes breathing, then call 911 and watch the infant closely until help arrives. If the infant stops breathing entirely at any time in the process or becomes unconscious, move to the next step.

, If the infant is unconscious, then you need to begin CPR. The method for giving an infant CPR is different than with a child or adult. Begin with chest compressions that will help maintain blood circulation to the brain. To perform chest compressions on an infant:Place the infant on a hard, flat surface—a table or even the floor will suffice.
Put two fingers on the center of the infant’s chest. Imagine a straight line between the baby’s nipples, and place the fingers just below where this line would be.
Press down with your fingers to compress the chest around 1.5 inches (3.8cm). The rate of the compressions should be around 100 per minute. However, ensure that the infant’s chest rises all the way back up between compressions.
Perform thirty compressions, counting them aloud as you go.

, The compressions may have dislodged the object in the baby’s throat. After thirty compressions, check the infant’s airway again. Tip the baby’s head back by lifting the chin while pressing down on the forehead with the other hand. Open the mouth to see if you can now remove the object—again, only if easily removable. Spend several seconds (no more than ten) feeling for breath and watching the infant’s chest to see if he or she is breathing without assistance.

, If the unconscious infant still isn’t breathing, you may want to perform rescue breathing techniques. However, new recommendations by the American Heart Association state that if you are untrained in CPR, you can just do chest compressions, and do not need to perform rescue breathing.To rescue breathe for the infant:Cover the infant’s mouth and nose with your mouth.
Use your cheeks (not your lungs) to deliver a quick, gentle blow of air that lasts one second. Provide a second breathe the same way.
Watch the baby’s chest to see if it rises, which will tell you if the breaths are getting around the blockage or not.
If air does not go in, reposition the head and try one more breath. If the first breath goes in, give a second rescue breath, and then do another set of chest compressions.

, You want to repeat the cycle of CPR (thirty chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths) for two minutes—about five cycles. If no one else has called 911 yet, this is the point where you should stop performing CPR to call emergency responders.The seconds can be precious. Continue giving the baby assistance as the phone rings, etc.
Follow the 911 operator’s instructions once the call is answered.

, Continue performing CPR cycles. Between chest compressions and rescue breathing, continue taking a few seconds to see if the blockage has been dislodged and if the baby has resumed breathing. Perform another cycle each time the baby shows no signs of life. Repeat until emergency responders arrive if necessary.If you are getting tired, see if there is another person trained in CPR to take over for you or help with two person CPR.

Soothe the burn with cold water.,
Take off jewelry that is on the affected area.,
Apply aloe on the burns that are not open wounds.,
Don’t pop blisters.,
Combat pain with over-the-counter medications.,
Check to see if your tetanus shot is up to date.,
Monitor the burn for signs of infections.",How to Treat Minor Burns," First-degree burns are the most common burns. You have a first-degree burn if only the outermost layer of skin is affected. These are the least severe type of burn and can usually be treated at home. Symptoms involve:Pain
Area is sensitive to the touch and warm to the touch
Minor swelling
Reddening of the skin;
, Second-degree burns are more serious than first-degree burns. The damage goes beneath the outer layer of skin to affect the layer underneath. You may have a scar after it heals. Symptoms of a second-degree burn include:Pain
Swelling
Blistering
Red, white, or blotchy skin
Reddened areas “blanch,” or turn white, when pressed with finger
The burned area may look wet

, Third-degree burns involve severe damage that includes tissues beneath the skin such as the layer of fat below the skin and possibly even the muscle or bone. Symptoms include:A waxy or leathery appearance to the skin
Reddened areas do not “blanch” or turn white when pressed on, but remain red
Swelling
Black or white areas on the skin
Numbness where the nerves have been damaged
Breathing problems
Shock — pale, clammy skin, weakness, blue lips and fingernails, and decreased alertness

, Someone with a third-degree burn requires immediate emergency care and EMS (9-1-1) should be called. If you have less serious burns you may still need to go to the emergency room. Seek professional medical care if:You have a third -degree burn.
You have a second-degree burn that covers more than 3 inches of skin.
You have a first or second-degree burn on your hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or a joint.
The burn is infected. Infected burns may seep liquid from the wound, and have pain, redness and swelling that gets worse over time.
The burn has extensive blistering.
You have a chemical or electrical burn.
You have inhaled smoke or a chemical.
You have problems breathing.
Your eyes have been exposed to a chemical.
You are uncertain of the severity of the burn
You have severe scarring or a burn that doesn’t heal after a few weeks.

, Cool water will lower the temperature of the burned area and stop the damage from progressing. Gently run cool water over the burn for at least 10 minutes.If the movement of water flowing over the burn is too uncomfortable, you can apply a clean, cool, wet towel.
Do not put ice or very cold water on the burn. The extreme temperatures may increase the damage to your tissues.

, If you have jewelry or other items that may restrict blood flow if the area swells, remove it immediately.Items that may need to be removed include rings, bracelets, necklaces, anklets, or any other item that could cut off circulation during swelling.
Swelling will start immediately so remove the items as soon as possible, but do so gently to avoid further irritation to the damaged tissues.

, The gel from aloe plants reduces pain and inflammation. It also promotes healing and helps your body repair damaged skin. Do not apply it to an open wound.Aloe is found in many gels and moisturizers. If you have a commercially prepared aloe vera gel, apply it according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
If you have an aloe plant in your house, you can obtain the gel directly from the plant. Break off a leaf and split it open lengthwise. You will see a clear, greenish goo inside. Dab it directly onto the burn and let it absorb into the skin.
If you do not have aloe, you can apply another moisturizer to prevent the burn from becoming too dry as it heals.
Don’t put greasy materials like butter on the wound.

, If you pop blisters, this creates an open wound and makes you vulnerable to an infection. If the blisters burst on their own you should:Wash the wound with soap and clean water.
Gently dab an antibiotic cream over the area.
Protect the area with a nonstick bandage.
Go to the doctor if you have blisters that are larger than 1/3 of an inch in diameter, even if they have not burst.

, Burns can be extremely painful. You may need painkillers to help you get through the day or fall asleep at night. Over-the-counter medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be effective; however, they may interfere with other medications so discuss them with your doctor before taking them. Medications with aspirin should never be given to children. If your doctor says it is ok for you, you can try:Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB)
Naproxen sodium (Aleve)
Acetaminophen (Tylenol)

, Tetanus is a disease that occurs when the tetanus bacteria infect an open wound. Your doctor will likely suggest that you get a tetanus shot if:The burn caused a deep wound or it is dirty.
You haven’t had a tetanus shot in the past five years.
You don’t know when your last tetanus shot was.

, Your skin provides you with a barrier against pathogens in the environment. A burn makes you vulnerable to infection. If you develop any of the following symptoms, go to the emergency room right away to have it checked by a doctor:Pus or fluid seeping from the wound
Swelling, redness, or pain that increases over time
Fever
Red streaks spreading from the burn site

This step should only be taken if the child is conscious; if the child is unconscious, begin CPR immediately.' If the choking child shows signs of reduced breathing, then you want to attempt to clear the airway by performing an abdominal thrust—also known as the Heimlich maneuver.To perform the maneuver:Wrap both of your arms around the child’s waist while tipping him or her slightly forward.
Form a fist with one of your hands and position it on the child’s stomach just barely above the navel. Grab your fist with your other hand.
Thrust the fist upward into the child’s abdomen quickly. Perform five times if necessary while watching to see if the object dislodges.
Check for breathing. If the child stops breathing completely at any point or becomes unconscious, then proceed to CPR.

, If the the child is unconscious then you need to begin emergency CPR to maintain circulation and provide oxygen. Performing chest compressions on a child is different than performing on an infant or an adult. To perform chest compressions on a child:Set the child down on his back on a flat, hard surface (most likely the floor), and kneel down beside the child’s shoulders, so you don’t have to reposition between chest compressions and rescue breathing.
Place the heel of your hand on the child’s chest between his nipples. Use only one hand since two can provide too much force.
Position your upper body over your hand and use your body weight and your arm to compress the child’s chest. You want to compress two inches (five centimeters). Press quickly at a rate of around 100 compressions per minute. However, you want the child’s chest to rise again completely between compressions.
Count the compressions aloud to a total of thirty.

, The compressions may have dislodged the object in the child’s throat. After thirty compressions, check the airway again. Tip the child’s head back by lifting the chin while pressing down on the forehead with the other hand.Open the mouth to see if you can now remove the object—again, only if easily removable. Spend several seconds (no more than ten) feeling for breath and watching the child’s chest to see if he or she breathes without assistance., If the child is small enough, place your mouth over his mouth and nose. Otherwise, you can use mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose breathing.Pinch the child’s nostrils closed for mouth-to-mouth breathing. To perform a rescue breath on a child:Cover the area with your mouth completely to form a seal.
Deliver a breath that lasts approximately one second into the child’s airway. If air does not go in, re-position the head before you try one more breath.
Provide a second breath before returning to chest compressions.

, Repeat the CPR procedure (thirty chest compressions and two breaths) for five cycles—or two minutes—before you call 911 if you have no one else around to call emergency responders for you.Follow the 911 operator’s instructions quickly, so you can return to CPR while awaiting help.

, Unless the child begins showing signs of life and breathing on his own, then you should repeat CPR cycles (thirty compressions and two breaths) until paramedics arrive and take over.If you become tired, see if there is another person trained in CPR to take over for you or help with two person CPR.

Continue performing CPR.",How to Treat an Unconscious Choking Adult or Child3," If the person has become unresponsive, you should first assess the situation. See if the person shows any signs of breathing at all—chest rising or hearing breathing when you place your ear close to the person’s nose and mouth.

, If another person is nearby, have that person call 911 while you begin taking first aid steps. If no one else is around to assist you, then make the call to 911 yourself before beginning CPR.Follow the 911 operator’s instructions quickly, so you can return to CPR while awaiting help.

, Lay the person out on her back on a hard, flat surface. Tilt her head back and open the mouth. If you can see the object, remove it, but only if the object is easily removed. If the object is lodged, you don’t want to risk pushing it farther into the person’s throat., If the person is unconscious or shows no signs of breathing, skip to the next step. This step should only be taken if the person is still conscious; otherwise you should begin CPR immediately. If the choking person shows signs of reduced breathing, then you want to attempt to clear the airway. Two methods are available based on how well you can move the person around:Back blows are the easiest option for a person who you cannot easily move. Roll the person onto his side or back and use the heel of your hand to thrust against the person’s back between the shoulder blades. Repeat fives times, watching for the object to dislodge.
If you can lift the person, try abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich maneuver) by placing your fist just above the person’s navel and quickly thrusting in and upward with both hands. Also repeat five times while watching for the object to dislodge.
Check for breathing. If the person stops breathing completely at any point or becomes unconscious, then proceed to CPR.

, If the person is unconscious, then you need to begin emergency CPR to maintain circulation and provide oxygen. Performing chest compressions on an adult is different than performing on an infant or a child. To perform chest compressions on an adult:Roll the person onto his back on a flat, hard surface (most likely the floor) and kneel down beside the person’s shoulders, so you don’t have to reposition between chest compressions and rescue breathing.
Place the heel of your hand on the person’s chest between his nipples. Place your other hand directly over your bottom hand to provide more leverage.
Position your upper body over your hands and use your body weight and your arms to compress the person’s chest. You want to compress two inches (five centimeters). Press quickly—a rate that allows you to perform 100 compressions per minute. However, ensure that the person’s chest rises completely between compressions.
Count the compressions aloud to a total of thirty.

, The compressions may have dislodged the object. After thirty compressions, check the airway again. Tip the person’s head back by lifting the chin while pressing down on the forehead with your other hand.Open her mouth to see if you can now remove the object—again, only if easily removable. Spend several seconds (no more than ten) feeling for breath and watching the person’s chest to see if she is breathing without assistance., After thirty chest compressions, you want to provide two rescue breaths (remember the 30:2 ratio). You can use mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose breathing, but ensure that you pinch the person’s nostrils shut for mouth-to-mouth breathing.To perform rescue breathing on an adult:Cover the area (mouth or nose) with your mouth completely to form a seal.
Deliver a breath that lasts approximately one second into the person’s airway. If air does not go in, re-position the head before you try one more breath.
Provide a second breath before returning to chest compressions.

, Unless the person begins showing signs of life and breathing on his own, then you should repeat CPR cycles (thirty compressions and two breaths) until paramedics arrive and take over.If you become tired, see if there is another person trained in CPR who can take over or assist with two person CPR.

The first step in helping a drowning victim is being able to spot someone in trouble. Lifeguards call surveillance of the area ""scanning and observing"".To scan and observe, you should spend a few seconds every couple of minutes looking around your area. Look at the water, and also look at the pool deck or beach. Keep your eyes out for people in distress, or in potentially risky situations. For example, if there is someone swimming far from shore in choppy waters, you'll want to keep a close watch on them. Keep your eye out for the elderly and young swimmers.
Get in the habit of scanning and observing your area whenever you are near water. This is especially important if there are children with you, or others who are not strong swimmers.;
, Active drowning means that the person is in the process of drowning. They will be impaired due to inhalation of water. There are several things to look for to determine whether someone is actively drowning.Active drowning can begin within 20 seconds of the person being in distress. An active drowning victim will not be able to call for help.
While an active drowning victim might still be vertical in the water, they will be unable to move towards help or safety.
Active drowning victims will not be able to wave for assistance or reach for equipment. Once drowning has begun, the victim cannot voluntarily control his arm movements.
Active drowning victims typically struggle on the surface for 20-60 seconds before being submerged.
Active drowning victims will have their heads tilted back so their mouth and nose is above water, this is an instinct.

, There are many other types of problems that can occur in swimmers. Make sure you are aware of different signs so that you can accurately assess the situation. For example, a distressed swimmer is a person who may have become tired or suffered a cramp. They may call out for help and may appear to be flailing.A passive drowning victim is someone who is unconscious in the water. Assume the person needs medical attention and call for help.
A tired swimmer might be using short, weak strokes and appear to be looking for something to cling to. They might call for assistance.

, Once you have determined that you are looking at an active drowning victim, get ready to reach the person. Based on your scanning and observing, you should be able to tell whether you need to go in the water or whether you can offer assistance from land. Take any tools you need, such as a flotation device, life vest, or pole.Alert someone else on the shore if you are swimming out to rescue the victim. You want someone else to be aware of the situation. Have them call for help.
Do not attempt a rescue unless you are a strong swimmer and know what you are doing. If you are a weak swimmer, you can put both yourself and the drowning victim in danger. The assistance of a flotation device even if you are a strong swimmer is important. Most professional lifeguards carry some sort of flotation device.

, Before you attempt a rescue, you need to make sure that you are not putting yourself in danger. It is a good idea to remember a phrase used by lifeguards: ""Reach, Throw, Row, Go with Support"". This means that you should always utilize safety tools to aid in the rescue.Make sure to always take a flotation device with you. You will need it in case you encounter problems, or you become tired. You may also need it to support the victim.
If possible, use a rescue tube. These devices are the easiest to utilize while performing a rescue.

, It is important to remember that only extremely competent swimmers should attempt rescues. If you do not know what you are doing, it is possible you could make the situation worse, despite your best intentions. If you are going to be near water, or plan to be, it's a great idea to take an advanced swimming course. Check with sources such as your local YMCA for options.Before you find yourself in this situation, make sure that you are aware of your own swimming skills. Don't attempt a rescue if you cannot easily swim 50 yards doing a breaststroke or front crawl. You must be a strong swimmer and confident in your swimming skills.
Make sure that you are capable of treading water for at least 2 minutes without struggling. Some protocols state that you should be able to treat 2 minutes in the water with a 10 lb weight. If you cannot do this, it is unlikely you are a strong enough swimmer to conduct a successful rescue.

, If the drowning victim is nearby, you may be able to use equipment to reach them. For example, almost all swimming pools have a tool called a shepherd's crook hanging on a wall or fence. The shepherd's crook is a long, thin pole that has a loop at one end.If you have experience using this tool, it is possible that you can extend the pole and aim the loop so it surrounds the victim. You can then pull the victim to shore.
Do not attempt to loop the victim if you are unfamiliar with this process. You might inadvertently cause more panic.
A flotation device is the most important tool in rescues. If you are going to swim out to the victim, make sure to take one with you.

, If possible, you should always approach an active drowning victim from behind. You may need to swim underwater and come up behind the victim to make this happen. Research shows that drowning victims almost always somehow drown while facing the shore. As you perform the rescue, you want the victim to keep the shore in sight. For this reason, it's better to approach from the rear and propel them with you towards the shore.Victims often begin to panic even more if they are turned away from the shore.
Remember that the victim cannot control his arm movements. Therefore, do not waste time saying things such as ""grab on"".

, You need to use your flotation device to help you stabilize the victim. This will make it easier for you to safely swim to shore. Place the victim on the rescue tube or other flotation device. Ask the victim to help you kick if you need it.To do this, approach the victim from behind and put your arms under their armpits, grab their shoulders and flip them on to you keeping your head to the side and out of harm’s way. Your rescue tube should be under your arms and between you and the victim. Try to calm them by telling them who you are, and that you are here to help. It is simple but effective.
Before you find yourself in an emergency situation, it is a good idea to practice this movement. In the safety of a pool, ask a friend or family member to volunteer to be your practice buddy.
Practice swimming from behind and firmly lifting the ""victim"" onto the tube.

, Once the victim is on the device, you need to get them back to land. Wrap your arm around his waist and begin to swim to shore. You will find a sidestroke most effective for this type of rescue.As you tow your victim, make sure you keep an eye on them. You want to make sure they remain safely on the flotation device. If necessary, pause to re-position them so they are stable.
If the flotation device is easy to grasp, you can pull the victim to shore by holding onto the device and towing that while you swim.

, Once you have reached shore, you need to continue to help the victim. If you have not already, call for medical help. It is very likely that the victim will still be having difficulty breathing, due to the water inhalation. Be sure to use ABC to check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation. First, check their airway by looking into their mouth and throat to see if you see anything lodged in it. Then, check to see if they are breathing. Then, check for a pulse.Place your ear next to his mouth to listen for breathing. You can also look at his chest to see if it is rising and falling due to breathing.
If you cannot see or hear breathing, check his pulse. Place your two first fingers on the wrist or neck to find a pulse. Hold there for 10 seconds.
If you cannot detect a pulse, begin CPR. Place the heel of your hand in the center of his chest, in line with the nipples. Make sure not to press on the ribs.
Begin chest compression by pressing down at the rate of at least 100 pulses per minute. Complete 30 compressions, make sure the chest is going all the way down and coming back up. There is a high chance of breaking their ribs so be prepared for that.
Check for breathing. If they are not breathing, start CPR again. It is very important to take CPR classes through your local Red Cross so that you can practice this technique. If you perform it incorrectly you will not do any good for the victim.

, Accidents happen, and it is certainly not possible to ensure that drowning incidents don't occur. However, there are many steps you can take to reduce the likelihood. By practicing caution and observing general safety rules, you can help keep those around you safe. For example, make sure that when you are near water that you have a flotation device with you.If possible, take a cell phone with you to the pool or beach so that you can call for help if necessary. Immediately after assessment point to someone and tell them to call EMS immediately.
Make sure that people who aren't strong swimmers have a life vest to wear.
Be aware of your surroundings. Even if you do not plan to swim, no that accidents can happen even when you are on the shoreline or by the side of a pool. Watch for people falling in the water accidentally.

, It is always best to swim with a lifeguard on duty. This is important for everyone, even strong swimmers. If you are going to be swimming in a pool, look for one with a regular lifeguard. You can also find beaches that employ lifeguards.Do not go in natural bodies of water if the conditions are unfavorable. For example, do not go in a lake if it is especially windy and the waves are strong.
You should avoid going in the ocean when the tides are aggressive. Many beaches post signs or flags advising you of conditions. Do not swim if a warning is posted.

, While anyone can drown, children are especially susceptible. If you have kids, make sure that you teach them to act responsibly around water. Have a set of rules for family swim excursions, and make sure that your children understand them.For example, you should implement the buddy system. Make sure that your child knows that they are never allowed to swim alone or without supervision.
If you are going out on a boat, take life vests that are child-sized.
Children can learn to swim as early as 1 year old. It's an excellent idea to begin swim lessons early.

Call emergency services.,
Offer life-saving aid first.,
Get the victim on a flat, stable surface.,
Protect the spine.",How to Rule Out a Spinal Cord Injury During First Aid1," If you haven’t done so already, call for help. Report concise details about the injury, the victim’s relevant information, and your exact location. In the meantime, provide first aid care as needed, taking care not to move the victim. Keep the head, neck, and back still and in alignment.;
, Spine protection and immobilization does not take priority over life-saving care.Life-saving procedures include CPR or stopping a bleeding wound. You should, however, modify the CPR technique if you suspect the victim may have injured their spine, or does not have a pulse.


Do not open the airway by tilting the head. Instead, use your fingers to gently lift the jaw forward.
Proceed with chest compressions if the person has no pulse.

, Remove the injured person from the accident scene in a safe manner. Have them lay down on a flat surface, if they aren’t already. Use a backboard, wooden door, or similar object to keep the back and neck straight when removing someone from water. Encourage them to keep calm and stay still.

, Once you’ve completed any necessary life-saving procedures, your immediate response must include immobilizing and protecting the spine. Roll up towels and place them on either side of the neck, or hold the victim’s head and neck in place. The ideal position for the patient is to lay flat on the back in a neutral position.If they can easily move their neck and spine into a neutral position, have them do so.
If there is pain or any resistance, you should abandon efforts to align their neck or back.
If they are unconscious but their spine is not in a neutral position, it’s best to wait for emergency personal to decide whether or not to make a manual adjustment.

"
Look for visible, primary signs of injury.,
Note other signs of a spinal cord injury.,

Shallow or irregular breathing (note the victim's breathing by feeling their chest if they're unconscious to asking them to report if they're conscious)
Exaggerated reflex activities or spasms
Pain or an intense stinging sensation

,
Check for neck trauma and nerve damage.,
Ask a conscious victim about their symptoms.,
Assume an unconscious person has a spinal cord injury.",How to Rule Out a Spinal Cord Injury During First Aid2," Once you’ve offered immediate care and stabilized the trauma victim, proceed to look for clear signs of spinal cord damage. Check if the neck or spine are twisted or in an odd position. Look for clear signs of fracture, bruising, or any penetrating wounds.

, Paralysis and loss of sensation (including ability to feel heat and cold) are the most obvious signs of spinal cord injury, but it’s also essential to check for related and lesser known symptoms. Such secondary symptoms may include:,, If the victim suffered a neck injury, it’s important to check for nerve damage to the head and face. A neck injury might also involve trauma to the throat’s structures and organs, so it’s important to identify injury in these locations as well.


Check for cranial and facial nerve damage, signs of which include twitching, drooping, hoarse voice, and improper position and movement of the tongue.
Damage to the trachea, larynx, and esophagus are indicated by trouble swallowing, drooling, bloody saliva, or an inability to talk despite being conscious.
Also check for numbness, tingling or loss of sensation in the person's hands, fingers, feet or toes

, If they are able to talk, ask them to report their symptoms. Ask if they are experiencing pain or pressure in the neck, back or head, or tingling or loss of sensation in the feet, toes, hands or fingers. Weakness or lack of control in any regions of the body are also signs of spinal damage.Be sure to keep your tone calm and reassuring. This is true for any emergency situation, but if a victim is worked up and their heartbeat increases, the increased blood flow can cause swelling and hemorrhaging that will aggravate a spinal injury.
Check whether a conscious victim can move arms and legs if limbs are uninjured.
Note good or poor coordination of movements. Coordination problems point to a spinal cord injury.

, If an injured person is unconscious, or are in and out of consciousness, assume the injury involves spinal cord damage. They can’t respond to your questions or report any symptoms, so it’s better to be on the safer side. This is especially true if you know the victim has suffered trauma to the head, neck, or back: the rule of thumb is suspect spinal injury until you can prove otherwise.

"
"
Do not remove a helmet.,
Don’t roll the patient by yourself.,
Err on the side of caution.",How to Rule Out a Spinal Cord Injury During First Aid3," If the injured person is wearing a helmet, leave it on. Removing it could upset the injury, especially if it involved neck trauma. Wait for emergency personnel to determine whether and how to remove it.

, If the trauma victim is vomiting or choking on blood, it might be necessary to roll them over onto their side. If at all possible, seek assistance from at least one other person to proceed. With one person at the head and others along the side of the injured person, carefully coordinate your movements to roll them over and prevent choking.

, Since the rule of thumb is assume spinal injury until proven otherwise, do not allow someone who has suffered a serious head, neck, or back trauma to walk around or move in any way. It’s common for a victim to be mobile after an injury, but suffer paralysis due to later hemorrhaging and swelling. It’s important to have a medical professional examine the injury, and to obtain imaging scans for the most accurate diagnosis."

Call for help.,
Know when to urgently call for medical help.If you notice any of the following signs or symptoms, it is especially key to call for help sooner rather than later as these can be signs of severe and/or life-threatening poisoning:


Confusion
Drowsiness or altered level of consciousness
Respiratory difficulty (such as shortness of breath or lack of breathing altogether)
Seizures
Uncontrollable restlessness or agitation

,
Collect any relevant information regarding the source of poisoning.If you have overdosed on medication or used illicit drugs, collect pill bottles or other information regarding the source of overdose to present to the medical team when they arrive.",How to Save Yourself from Poisoning1," If you suspect that you have been poisoned, it is key to call for help immediately.The time delay between the poisoning and treatment can mean the difference between life and death in some cases. Therefore, call Emergency Medical Services (911) immediately, or your local Poison Control Centre for advice on how best to proceed.


The phone number for the Poison Control Centre in the United States is 1-800-222-1222.When you provide them with the information regarding the poisoning, they can guide you regarding the best course of action as well as any information regarding a potential antidote.
Information you will need to provide includes your age and symptoms, as well as the type of agent that caused the poisoning and the specific amount that you were exposed to (or ingested), if you know this information.;
,, Regardless of the type of poisoning, the more specific information you can offer healthcare professionals, the better your chances are of saving yourself and surviving the incident.


Again, bring any products or pill bottles with you to the hospital or have the available for emergency personnel.

"
"
Remove any clothing with toxic substances.If your clothing is contaminated with a poisonous or toxic substance, remove it as quickly as possible to prevent further contact of the poison with your skin.,
Clean your skin with a shower or washcloth.If your skin has a poisonous substance on it, hop in the shower or use a wet washcloth to remove it as soon as possible.,
Flush out your eyes.If you have gotten a poisonous substance in your eye and there is an eye wash station available (as there are in many chemistry labs and academic settings), use the eye wash station immediately to flush out your eye.,
Get yourself into an environment with fresh air.If it is an inhaled poison such as smoke from a fire, or carbon monoxide, get outside into the fresh air as soon as possible.,
Read the label to see if there are instructions for how to handle accidental poisoning from ingestion.If you have ingested a toxic substance and know what the substance is (such as a household cleaning agent), read the label to see if there is guidance as to how to minimize the damaging effects.",How to Save Yourself from Poisoning2," Wear gloves if you can so that your bare hands do not come into unnecessary contact with dangerous substances.

, The less time your skin spends in contact with toxic materials the better, as this will decrease damage to the skin as well as potential absorption of the poison through your skin.

, If you are at home or in another setting, run the tap with cool or lukewarm water and place the affected eye underneath it. Flush out your eye for up to 20 minutes, or until medical help arrives.

, The less time spent inhaling toxic fumes the better, as this can help to prevent serious lung injury and, in severe cases, death.

, There may also be information regarding a potential antidote.

"
Have your vital signs monitored.The first thing that will happen when you arrive in the Emergency Department is that a nurse will check your vital signs, including your respiration rate, your pulse, your blood pressure, and other important data such as the oxygen levels in your blood.,
Have activated charcoal administered if needed.If you have ingested a toxic substance (including pill overdoses), the emergency room physician may give you activated charcoal.,
Be aware of other tests and treatments you may need.You may need to go for a CT scan, have an ECG (a test on your heart), and/or have blood or urine tests done to help your doctor to confirm the diagnosis and the source of your poisoning.",How to Save Yourself from Poisoning3," You will likely be hooked up to monitors for continual evaluation of your vital signs, as the doctors identify and treat the cause of your poisoning.


You may need to receive IV fluids, have oxygen delivered via nasal prongs, or receive other medical support to ensure that your vital signs do not get into a dangerous range.

, What this does is it inhibits further absorption of the toxic substance through your intestine. It depends upon the cause of your poisoning whether or not this is effective. In certain cases, if administered soon enough after ingestion, activated charcoal can save your life.


If you throw up the activated charcoal, you must, unfortunately, take another dose.

, Once the cause of your poisoning has been confirmed, your doctor can then administer any antidotes to reverse the effects of the poison, if a specific antidote exists for your form of poisoning. If not, your doctor will treat you on a symptom basis, giving you medication as needed to keep you safe until you recover.

"
Stop what you're doing if you experience chest pain.,
Assess whether your chest pain is likely a heart attack.,
Look for other symptoms.,
Look for symptoms of related illnesses.,
Take your risk factors into consideration.",How to Respond to a Heart Attack1," Pay close attention to your symptoms. People who have had a heart attack describe the pain as discomfort, chest tightness, a squeezing sensation, burning or an uncomfortable pressure or heaviness in the middle of the chest. This chest pain is called ""Angina.""


The pain may come and go. It typically starts out mild, gradually intensifies and peaks within the next few minutes.
Pain does not worsen when applying pressure to the chest or when taking deep breaths, if it is the result of a heart attack.
Typically this chest pain is brought on by exertion, any type of exercise or yard work, even a heavy meal in your blood as your blood flows and is moved towards your gastrointestinal tract. If the symptoms occur at rest, it is termed “Unstable Angina, and poses a greater risk of a lethal heart attack.Women and diabetics are more likely to experience atypical angina.;
, There are several reasons you could be having chest pain. The most common are indigestion, panic attacks, a pulled muscle, and heart attacks.If you have just eaten a rich meal or have just done a hard chest workout, you probably are having the symptoms due to reasons other than a heart attack.
If you can't think of another reason for the symptoms, then assume you are having a heart attack and seek out help as soon as possible.

, During a heart attack, most people will have chest pain along with at least one other symptom. You often experience shortness of breath, dizziness or palpitations, sweating, or you may feel sick to your stomach and vomit.


Common heart attack symptoms include feeling a choking sensation or a lump in the throat, heartburn, indigestion, or the need to swallow repeatedly.
A person having a heart attack may perspire and become chilled at the same time. She or he may have periods of cold sweats.
Heart attack victims may feel numbness in either arm, hand or both.
Some people experience a rapid and irregular heartbeat, heart palpitations, or shortness of breath.
Look for atypical symptoms. For instance, although uncommon, the patient may feel a sharp or dull pain or ache in the middle of the chest.

, Disease of the coronary arteries, coronary plaques, and atheromas are more complex conditions than CAD but they can result in the same blockage of the arteries to the heart. For instance, coronary “plaques” are a layer of cholesterol in the lining in the artery that creates small tears where at different times the plaque has started to tear away from the artery wall. Blood clots have formed at the site of tiny tears on the inside lining of the artery and the body has responded to this with more inflammation.Since this progression of the plaque can occur slowly over time patients may experience periods of chest pain or discomfort and ignore it. Or specifically only experience it when they are under increased cardiac stress.
The patient may consequently not seek any medical treatment until the plaque has gotten so big as to stop blood flow significantly even when the person is at rest, when cardiac demand is low.
Or worse, when the plaque breaks off and blocks flow altogether, causing a heart attack. This can happen anytime, and for many this is the first sign that they are having a heart attack.

, When you seek evaluation for your symptoms, most specifically chest pain, the next most important factor or perhaps equally important, is your “risk factor profile."" We have so much data and evidence regarding CAD that we know it occurs more often in certain populations. Cardiovascular Risk Factors (CVRF) include: being male, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, obesity (BMI greater than 30), age greater than 55 years, and a family history of heart disease.


The more risk factors you possess, the more likely the symptoms you are experiencing are due to underlying CAD. Knowing these risk factors will allow your healthcare provider to evaluate your symptoms, depending on how likely they are due to coronary disease.

Be prepared for an emergency before one actually happens.,
Act quickly.,
Call emergency services or have someone drive you to the hospital.,
Administer CPR after calling for help, as needed.,
Get a conscious sufferer comfortable.,
Take nitroglycerin tablets, as directed by your doctor.,
Chew one regular aspirin while waiting for the ambulance.",How to Respond to a Heart Attack2," Know where the closest hospital is to your home and your work. Also keep a list of emergency numbers and information at a central and visible location in your home, so that someone visiting your home will see it if there is an emergency., Prompt action can prevent serious damage to your heart, and it may even save your life. The quicker you respond to the symptoms of a heart attack, the more likely you are to survive. , Do not drive yourself. Get trained medical help as quickly as possible. In general, do not leave the person alone except to call emergency help.


Seeking help in the first hour of a heart attack greatly improves your chance of recovery.
Describe your symptoms to the emergency response operator. Be brief and speak clearly.

, If you are witnessing someone having a heart attack, it may be necessary to perform CPR. You only need to do CPR if the person having the heart attack is unconscious and has no pulse, or if the emergency operator instructs you to do so. Continue to administer CPR until the ambulance and medics arrive.


An emergency response operator can give you instructions detailing how to perform CPR if you do not know.

, Sit or lie down and keep the head elevated. Loosen any tight clothing so that the person can move and breath easily. Do not allow a person with chest pain or who has had a heart attack to walk.

, If you have a history of heart attacks and have been prescribed nitroglycerin by your doctor, take the pills when you experience symptoms of a heart attack. Your doctor should have given you recommendations about when to take the pills.

, Aspirin makes your platelets less sticky, reduces the chance of blood clots and keeps your blood flowing through your arteries. If you don't have any aspirin available, do not give the sufferer anything else. No other over-the-counter painkillers will do the same thing.


Chewing helps the aspirin absorb faster into the bloodstream than simply swallowing it. Speed is necessary for treating heart attacks.

"
"
Give a full accounting of the event.,
Get a full medical work-up.,
Get immediate medical treatment.,
Get surgery if necessary.",How to Respond to a Heart Attack3," Your visit to the hospital or doctor's office will begin with a careful history of your symptoms, with special attention to the timing and characteristics of your pain and associated symptoms. You will also need to give a careful inventory of your risk factors (CVRF).

, You will be hooked up to cardiac monitors by the nursing staff for continuous heart monitoring. The electrocardiogram (EKG) will look for changes consistent with your heart not getting enough blood.


Labs will be drawn, including “cardiac enzymes” that the heart puts out when there is damage; these are called Troponin, and CPK-MB.
You will likely receive a chest X-ray to look for heart enlargement or fluid in the lungs from heart failure, The cardiac enzymes are drawn three times, once every eight hours, to be most accurate

, If any of these tests come back abnormal you will be admitted. If your EKG shows elevation of certain segments, you will consult with a cardiologist about having an emergent cardiac catheterization, called angioplasty, to restore blood flow in the heart.A cardiac catheterization involves gaining access to your femoral artery and feeding a wire with dye to take pictures of your coronary arteries, looking for blockages. The number of arteries involved, which arteries are involved, and the precise location of blockages will determine management.
Typically lesions of greater than 70% blockage are opened with a balloon catheter and stented. Lesions that are between 50-70% blocked are considered intermediate and until recently were not opened up, but relegated to medical therapy alone. , Bypass surgery is preferred if you have disease of the left main artery or more than two arteries with blockages. Surgery is scheduled and you will likely await surgery in the coronary care unit (CCU).


Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery (CABG) involves taking the veins from your leg and harvesting them for transfer to literally “bypass” the blockages on your heart arteries.
While this surgery occurs, you are taken into a hypothermic state and your heart is stopped for a period of time, while your blood is circulated outside of your body by a cardiopulmonary bypass machine. The cardiothoracic surgeon can then sew on the heart. The beating would not permit this delicate work, as grafts must be sewn on the heart from veins and arteries.
Also, because arterial grafts are better than vein grafts, your own Left Internal mammary artery is carefully dissected out from its location on your chest wall and diverted from its normal course and carefully sewn into your Left Anterior Descending Artery just past the blockage. This gives you the very best chance of having a long-lasting patent graft that will not block up again. The LAD is a very important heart artery, feeding your all-important left ventricle, which is why this laborious process is undertaken.
The other coronary blockages are bypassed carefully with harvested vein from the saphenous vein in your leg.

"
"
Focus on medical recovery.,
Lower your cholesterol.,
Lower your blood pressure.,
Modify your lifestyle.",How to Respond to a Heart Attack4," If you had CAD but your blockages were not sufficient to require intervention, you may simply receive suggestions for avoiding further episodes. You may have undergone intervention with angioplasty with blockages less than 70% or you could have had surgery to replace some of the arteries to your heart. In either of these cases, follow your doctor's recommendations about recovery. Make sure to avoid stress and focus on relaxation when trying to physically recover from a heart attack.

, There is significant research that we can lower the risk of heart attack with aggressive cholesterol management.This can be accomplished with medication and lifestyle changes, such as a adopting a healthy diet., Blood pressure is a primary risk factor for CAD. In patients with known CAD, a drop in Systolic Blood Pressure (the top number) of just 10 mm/.Hg decreased cardiovascular events by a full 50 percent.There are several classes of drugs, from beta blockers to ace inhibitors, that can help patients lower their blood pressure.
Contact your medical provider for suggestions, and a prescription, for a blood pressure medication.

, It is very important to lower your risk of having another heart attack. While this can be helped with medication, it is also your responsibility to make changes to your lifestyle that will lower that risk. Some important changes you can make include:


Adopt a low-sodium diet: Adopt a low-sodium diet. This means that your should be eating less than 2 grams of sodium per day.
Focus on stress reduction: Some people relax via meditation, a supervised exercise program, and others use hobbies, such as reading or yoga. Music therapy is another suggestion.
Lose weight: Get your BMI below 30 via healthy and balanced diet. Consult with a nutritionist or dietician to create a diet that will work well for you. However, with any suspected CAD get your healthcare provider permission prior to starting any exercise program, as exercise may precipitate a heart attack
Stop smoking: This is the single most important thing you can do. Cigarette Smoking contributes heavily to coronary plaques and atherosclerosis. It increases your risk of heart attack by between 25 and 45% according to the Framingham Heart Study for primary and secondary prevention, respectively.

Detect ""flail chest"" by a section of ribs moving in and out opposite to the rest of the ribs during breathing due to air pressures. It is most commonly seen in cases of serious blunt trauma (falling from a height, automobile wreck or other accident)., They will most often heal while held in line only by the other ribs and by your muscles. See your doctor and you will probably be told, ""Take it easy from heavy work/lifting for a couple months.""""There is no specific treatment for a rib fracture, but various supportive measures can be taken. In simple rib fractures, pain can lead to reduced movement and cough suppression; this can contribute to formation of secondary chest infection. Adequate analgesia can avoid this"" .






To bind the ribs tightly is not advised (without medical instructions). There is not much of a way to brace your ribs.
Wrapping may seem logical, but is of doubtful benefit.
To brace the ribs could cause rigidity and even induce more pain.

Look for symptoms related to the skin.,
Watch for changes in brain function.,
Check for weak pulse and low blood pressure.,
Listen for rapid, shallow breathing.,
Take notice of chest pain.,
Feel for a rapid heart beat.,
Be aware of little or no urine output.,
Consider the potential causes of obstructive shock.,
Call emergency services or get to a hospital immediately.,
Check for circulation and breathing.,
Lay the person down.,
Initiate rescue breathing and CPR if necessary.",How to Spot Obstructive Shock Symptoms," Signs and symptoms of obstructive shock begin to show when the heart fails to pump enough blood to the rest of the body.Some of the first signs that are noticeable involve the skin, such as excessive sweating, clamminess, reduced temperature and a general paleness.


If the skin looks pale and feels clammy, touch the fingers and toes to see if they're chilly. That's a good indication that there's a circulation problem.
A lack of oxygen to tissues can make the skin look pale, but also with a bluish tint — a condition called cyanosis.;
, Another set of signs and symptoms common with obstructive shock are related to brain function and consciousness. Reduced blood and oxygen to the brain quickly leads to lightheadedness, confusion, problems concentrating, anxiety, restlessness and loss of consciousness (ultimately).Any problem involving a blockage of blood (heart attack, stroke, pulmonary embolism, severe atherosclerosis) will cause similar behaviors and impairments.
If you sense any of these symptoms in someone else, carry on a short conversation with them — they won't make any sense if they are experiencing obstructive shock.

, As the heart or surrounding major blood vessels (aorta, vena cava) are unable to pump enough blood to the body, the pulse and pressure in the cardiovascular system drops.Low blood pressure (hypotension) contributes to lightheadedness and dizziness, especially when trying to stand up from a seated or horizontal position.


Although blood pressure varies from person to person, a reading of 90 / 60 mmHg or less is generally considered hypotension.The best places to feel for a pulse are the inside wrist, inside part of the ankle and the neck close to the jaw line. A strong pulse is obvious; a weak pulse is barely detectable.

, Due to a weak heartbeat and pulse, the body increases the breathing rate in attempts to get enough oxygen into the blood so the cells, tissues and organs don't start to die.However, the breathing isn't deep like it would be if the person was simply winded — instead it's shallow and rapid. This kind of breathing quickly leads to a dry mouth and thirst.


Look at the chest (or lightly touch it) to see if it's rising and falling quickly, which indicates rapid and shallow breathing.
Hold your ear close to the person's mouth to better detect if their breathing is rapid and shallow.
A normal respiration rate for a calm adult is between 12 to 20 breaths per minute — above 25 is considered abnormal., Chest pain is a typical symptom related to problems in the heart or lungs, which are the most common locations for obstructions leading to shock.Cardiovascular chest pain can sort of mimic heartburn or indigestion, but usually it's more severe and involves a feeling of fear or impending doom. Chest pain from a heart obstruction often involves referral pain to the left shoulder blade and down the left arm also.


Chest pain from a heart obstruction tends to be felt a little more on the left side of the upper chest, whereas as lung (pulmonary) obstruction is often felt more centrally or slightly to the right.
An obstruction in the lower aorta or vena cava often triggers pain lower in the stomach / intestinal area.

, Although a person's pulse rate is weak (difficult to feel) with obstructive shock, their heart rate (number of beats per minute) is actually increased or elevated because their body is trying to overcome the shortage of blood around the body.In essence, the heart beats faster, but not enough blood gets to peripheral arteries in the limbs to be easily detected.


A normal pulse rate for a healthy resting adult ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.Levels above this indicate a problem with the heart.
Put your hand on the person's heart or close to it (such as the base of the neck) to see if it seems to be working harder than normal.
It's also not uncommon for an overworked heart to flutter or ""skip a beat"" with an obstruction.

, Another symptom of obstructive shock, and one that represents advanced organ failure, is little or no production of urine.As such, urinating is either very difficult or impossible because the kidneys no longer work well enough to filter water out of the blood, produce urine and send it to the bladder.

, Obstructive shock occurs when there's a physical obstruction that prevents the heart from filling. However, you will probably not be able to determine the cause of the shock. This will be evaluated by medical personal at the hospital using diagnostic tests. Common causes of obstructive shock may include:heart malformations or lesions
tension pneumothorax
cardiac tamponade
pulmonary thromboembolism
aortic dissection
vena cava syndrome

, Obstructive shock requires immediate medical attention because it's life-threatening.As such, if you notice any of the above-mentioned symptoms with yourself or with friends / family, call 9-1-1 for assistance immediately or transport the person to the emergency department of a hospital. Don't drive yourself if you feel any symptoms.


Call as soon as any of the signs and symptoms begin to develop — don't wait for them to get better or go away.
Stay with the person until medical assistance arrives and practice basic CPR while waiting.

, While waiting for medical professionals to arrive, make sure the person is conscious and still able to breathe. As long as they are still conscious and their heart is still functioning, check the person’s rate of breathing every 5 minutes or so to see if it becomes more rapid.The more rapid and shallow the breathing, the more likely the person is about to have a heart attack and/or go unconscious.
Put your hand on their chest and keep your ear close to their mouth to monitor breathing and heart rate.

, If the breathing becomes more labored and shallow, lay the person down so they don't injure themselves if they lose consciousness. Help them into the shock position (assuming there's no injury to the head, neck, spine or legs), by laying them down flatly with their feet elevated by about 12 inches, which will help improve circulation.Loosen any tight clothing, especially around the neck.


Do not elevate their head because it makes it harder for the blood to get to their brain and may make symptoms worse.
If there's any vomiting or drooling, turn their head to the side to prevent them from choking.
Cover the person with a blanket or jacket to keep them warm, as shock causes the person to become hypothermic.

, If the person loses their pulse and stops breathing altogether, initiate rescue breathing (mouth-to-mouth) and other CPR techniques if you are properly trained.If you're not, then it's probably a better idea to just wait with the person until medical help arrives. Stay on the phone with 9-1-1 and they will advise you what to do. Although keep in mind that initial brain damage can occur in as little as five minutes once a person stops breathing and their heart stops beating.Thrusting over the person's heart helps circulate the blood somewhat, and in rare situations, it can ""kick start"" the heart into beating again.
Alternate chest thrusting with blowing air into the person's mouth. Make sure to elevate their chin (to open the airways) and pinch their nose so the air is forced down into the lungs.
Give two breaths, then 30 chest compression and then alternate between the two for as long as you can until help arrives.Compression only CPR is preferred for less trained rescuers."

Repeat process as necessary.",How to Remove Super Glue from Your Skin (Petroleum Jelly Method)1," So long as the super glue isn’t on or inside of your eyes or inside of your mouth, you can safely remove super glue at home. If you have super glue on any of these other regions, see your doctor or visit an emergency room or urgent care as soon as possible.A doctor can most effectively remove super glue from the sensitive eye areas.In most cases, super glue will solidify on contact with saliva. You can rinse out your mouth copiously with water, but it’s advisable to see a doctor as soon as possible.;
, Before you begin any measures to remove super glue with petroleum jelly, rinse off your skin copiously with warm, soapy water.This can help to loosen the super glue and prepare your skin for removal.You can use any mild soap to flush your skin.
Ensure that the water isn’t too hot when rinsing your skin so that you don’t burn it. Use a thermometer to check the water temperatures. Optimal temperatures for water are between 36 and 40 degrees., As you flush off your skin, take off any clothing on or around the affected area. This can help ensure that you don’t get any more super glue on your skin.Rinse skin for at least 15 minutes.Wash any clothing or shoes before you put them on again.Gently dab the affected skin dry so that you don’t irritate it.

, Apply a generous amount of petroleum jelly to the skin stuck with super glue. This can help to further release the product from your skin in an effectively and painless manner.Gently rub the petroleum jelly over the affected area. Do this until the product comes off of your skin.If you don’t have any petroleum jelly, you can use vegetable or mineral/ baby oil or even products such as lip balm that contain petroleum jelly.If you have super glue on your lips and are using petroleum jelly, be sure to not pull your lips apart, instead rolling or peeling your lips apart.Make sure to gently peel super glue from other areas of your skin as well., Once you’ve removed the super glue on your skin, wash and dry the affected area. This can help to remove any debris or residue that has remained on your skin.Use mild soap and warm water to wash just as you did before you used the petroleum jelly., If the super glue is particularly stubborn and won’t come off, simply repeat the washing and petroleum jelly process as necessary. If repeated attempts don’t successfully remove the super glue or your skin becomes irritated or infected, seek medical treatment immediately."

Dip a soft cloth in the water and put it on the affected skin.Hold the compresses on for 30 seconds before trying to remove the super glue., You can use a variety of oils to help remove super glue from your skin. From vegetable to almond oils, these may help get rid of super glue residue on your skin as effectively as petroleum jelly.You can use any type of oil including vegetable, olive, almond, baby or mineral oil.Pour the oil on a piece of cloth or gauze and rub it on your skin for a couple of minutes.Make sure to be gentle so that you don’t further irritate your skin., Lotions may also effectively remove super glue and its residue from your skin.Apply a small amount to the affected area to begin getting rid of the product.You can use a cloth or your hands to apply the lotion to the affected skin. Gently rub it and it should easily peel super glue from your skin.You can use most types of lotion, though emollient hand lotions may be the best and most gentle options., Many people have successfully removed super glue with acetone or nail polish remover.Be aware that while this can effectively get rid of super glue on your skin, it can also irritate your skin, and should probably only be used when other methods don’t work.Do not use acetone anywhere near your eyes or mouth.Only use acetone on smaller skin surfaces that have super glue., Use a nail file or skin buffer to gently exfoliate the affected area. This may also remove stubborn or lingering super glue on your skin.


You can use nail files or emery boards, or even skin exfoliators such as loofahs.
In addition, simple table salt can work as an exfoliant. Wet the area with water and rub the salt into the super glue until it forms a paste. This can help loosen the glue and lift it from your skin.
Be as gentle with these products as possible, as they are likely to irritate your skin from repeated rubbing.

, If you are unable to remove the super glue from your skin after repeated treatments, seek medical treatment as soon as possible. This can help prevent infection as well as remove the lingering adhesive from your skin.If you skin shows any signs of infection or severe inflammation, see a doctor immediately.
You should also see a doctor immediately if you get super glue on or in your eye, or in your mouth."

Talk to your doctor about proper wound care.",How to Remove Steri Strips," Apply a wet washcloth over the area covered by Steri-Strips. Hold it there for 30 to 60 seconds, or until the strips feel thoroughly soaked.Do not soak the injury in water, as that gets water in the healing wound.


If water alone does not loosen the adhesive on the Steri-Strips, try using a solution made of equal parts water and peroxide.Combine the two in a plastic cup, soak the washcloth in the new solution.
Gently lay the solution-soaked washcloth over the Steri-Strips for 60 seconds.;
, Stabilize your skin by gently pressing down on either side of each strip with two fingers.Switch the placement of your fingers as needed so that you are directly supporting the skin around each strip as you remove it.


If you cannot use two fingers, one finger may suffice. Place the finger on one side of the strip you plan to remove, pressing down with just enough force to make the skin slightly taut.

, If any strips were applied over the ends of your primary Steri-Strips, remove those first. Simply lift one end of each strip and gently pull across the length of the strip until you reach the opposite end.These cross stays run parallel to the wound and are usually placed 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) away from the ends of the primary strips.
The main function of the cross stays is to support the primary strips, reducing the risk of premature peeling and skin tension blisters.

, For each primary strip, begin by lifting one end and peeling it back in the direction of the incision. Stop just before reaching the incision itself.Grab the strip so that the fingers used to pull it away are continually positioned just above the skin.
Pull this end away slowly, passing the strip back over itself. Pull the strip back on top of itself, doubling back, rather than lifting up.
As you peel the strip away, shift your supporting fingers so that they move closer to the newly exposed skin.

, Peel each strip in the direction of the wound. As before, stop peeling the strip away before you reach the wound.Note that you will be pulling in the opposite direction used for the first end. In other words, if you pulled the first end to the left, the second end should be pulled to the right.
By pulling each strip towards the wound, you should avoid pulling the Steri-Strip directly off the wound itself. Avoid pulling a Steri-Strip off as you would a Band-Aid.

, Start at the top of the wound and gently lift the center of the Steri-Strip off, pulling it down toward the bottom of the incision. Pull slowly and gently.Make sure that you are still supporting the newly exposed skin with one or two fingers.
Continue at an even, slow pace. If you feel any resistance from the strip, try wetting it again to loosen the adhesive more or peeling it from a different direction.

, Remove each primary Steri-Strip from the wound in the same manner, working slowly and gently to reduce the risk of reopening the wound. Avoid tugging the strip or your skin.Do not be alarmed if you see dead skin peeling away with the strips.
It is also fairly normal for brown or green patches to form on the adhesive side of the strip. Brown discoloration can be caused by dried blood. Green discoloration can be caused when the oils of your skin get trapped beneath the strip and dry.

, Gently washed the newly exposed skin with warm water and antibacterial soap. Pat dry with a clean, soft towel when done.Gently lather the area with antibacterial soap and warm water for 30 to 40 seconds.
Rinse the soap away, then clean the area again for another 30 to 40 seconds in the same manner.
Patting the area dry, rather than scrubbing it, prevents the wound from reopening.

, The physician, nurse, or other healthcare professional in charge of your treatment may have specific instructions regarding the proper care of your wound once the Steri-Strips are off. It is recommended that you check with your healthcare provider for any necessary continuation of care.If there are no special requirements, you should care for the wound simply by washing it gently and letting it dry completely before covering it with anything (bandages, clothing, etc.).
Avoid exposing the wound to sunlight since excess sun can irritate the area and cause the scar to turn red.
Depending on your circumstances and the speed at which your wound is healing, your physician or nurse may recommend that you apply more Steri-Strips or another type of bandage over the area for a few more days.
Wounds that have been closed with strips and then left open can often become dry. Ask your doctor about a viable cream to apply to keep the area moist and reduce scarring. Creams with silica in them or Vitamin K have been shown to help reduce scarring.

A life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate attention.
A car crash.;
, The emergency number varies by country. In the United States, it's 911 and is 112 across most of Europe.

, The first thing the emergency dispatcher will ask is where you are located, so the emergency services can get there as quickly as possible. Give the exact street address, if possible; if you're not sure of the exact address, give approximate information.

, This information is also imperative for the dispatcher to have, so he or she is able to call back if necessary., Speak in a calm, clear voice and tell the dispatcher why you are calling. Give the most important details first, then answer the dispatcher's follow-up questions as best you can.


If you're reporting a crime, give a physical description of the person committing the crime.
If you're reporting a fire, describe how the fire started and where exactly it is located. If someone has already been injured or is missing, report that as well.
If you're reporting a medical emergency, explain how the incident occurred and what symptoms the person currently displays.

, After the dispatcher has gathered all the necessary information, he or she may tell you to assist the person or people in need. You may receive instructions on how to give emergency medical treatment, such as CPR. Pay careful attention, and do not hang up the phone until you are instructed to do so. Then follow the instructions you were given.

Pull off the tape in one smooth motion, if you can.,
Wash the area with soap and water after all the fiberglass is gone.",How to Remove Fiberglass Slivers from Your Skin1," Increase your chances of successfully removing the slivers by removing them in a well-lit area. The thin fiberglass fibers are a white or light yellow color. They can be hard to see when stuck in your skin.;
, You want a tape, like duct tape or electrical tape, that will not rip into pieces when it is pulled. You also want a tape that has a lot of glue to stick to the fiberglass splinters.

, This technique works best if the tape can get a solid hold on the fiberglass splinters. Water will make the fiberglass slivers soft and harder to pull out of your skin.

, Hold the tape in place for several minutes with your hand. Make sure the tape makes good contact with your skin and the fiberglass splinters.

, Ripping the tape off in a sudden or jerky fashion could take some skin with it, or create sores. This will make the fiberglass slivers even harder to remove. Grip the tape as close to your skin as possible and peel it up and away from your skin. It may be necessary for you to repeat this step several times.


Remember that the tape you are using is not made to be gentle on your skin. Therefore, you will have to take extra care removing it.
Check the area under the light or with the magnifying glass to make sure all the fiberglass is gone. Rub the area gently with clean hands to feel for anything sharp or tender. This could be a sign that you still have fiberglass in the area.

, Pat the area dry. Apply an antibiotic ointment like Neosporin to prevent infection.It is normal for bacteria or germs to be on the outer layer of our skin. However, the nicks made in your skin by the fiberglass splinters could allow germs or bacteria to get under the skin, which could lead to a skin infection."

Pull out the fiberglass fiber(s) gently with the tweezers.,
Squeeze the skin after all the fiberglass is gone.,
Wash the area again with soap and water.",How to Remove Fiberglass Slivers from Your Skin2," Most people have bacteria and germs on their skin. However, these germs can cause an infection if they get under the skin through the nicks made by the fiberglass splinters.If the fiberglass slivers are in your hand(s), skip this step. You do not want to push the slivers deeper into your skin.

, Fiberglass splinters have a tendency to break. You do not want them to break off below the skin or be pushed deeper into your skin.Cleanse the area by letting soapy water flow over it, but don't rub or scrub the area. You could force fibers deeper into your skin.


Pour water into any container, rub the soap in between your wet hands, and submerge your hands in the water. Repeat until the water is soapy. If your hands are the affected area, someone will have to do this for you.
The same germs that are on your hands are on the skin around the fiberglass slivers. Once you begin to move the slivers around trying to remove them, there is a risk of infection if the germs get under the skin., Look for fine-tipped tweezers to make grabbing the fibers easier. Bacteria is on every object we use. The alcohol destroys these germs so that you do not put them under the skin as you try to pull out the fiberglass splinters.Rubbing alcohol or ethyl alcohol kills germs by dissolving their outer protective coating; they fall apart and die., Increase your chances of success with removing the fiberglass splinters by working in a well-lit area. The thin fiberglass fibers are a white or light yellow color. They can be hard to see when they are in your skin.

, Focus on the tips of the fibers and grasp them, then pull them slowly away from your skin. Try not to push them in deeper. Use a needle if this happens or if the splinter is already completely under the skin.Use a sewing needle that has been sterilized with rubbing alcohol to gently lift skin or break through skin if you can see the splinter just under the skin. Then you can use the tweezers to remove the fiberglass.Do not become frustrated if it takes several attempts to get the splinters out. They can be small. If the tweezers and needle truly are not effective, try using the sticky tape method.

, The bleeding can help wash out germs. This is another way to keep germs from getting under your skin., Pat the area dry. Apply an antibiotic ointment like Neosporin. You do not have to cover the area you worked on with a bandage."

Look for redness in the skin where the fiberglass used to be.,
Seek medical attention if the fiberglass splinters remain in your skin.,
Protect yourself from the fiberglass next time.",How to Remove Fiberglass Slivers from Your Skin3," Over time, distinguish between irritation and infection. The treatments are different.


The fiberglass splinters can cause your skin to become inflamed. You may develop redness along with intense itching and small superficial wounds. Nothing but time can help your wounds to heal. It will help if you avoid working around fiberglass. A steroid cream like Cortaid or a soothing substance like petroleum jelly could make your irritated skin feel better.If the redness in your skin is associated with increased warmth and/or pus, this means you may have a skin infection. Seek medical attention to see if you need antibiotics., Even if your skin is not irritated right now, it could begin to be bothered by the fiberglass. Let a doctor remove the fiberglass for you.If you suspect that the area is infected, see a doctor as soon as possible.

, Wear gloves or clothing that do not allow the fiberglass to be on your skin. Do not rub or scratch if you see fibers collecting on the skin. Do not touch your eyes or face while working with the fiberglass, and wear goggles and a mask to avoid fibers getting into your eyes or lungs.Rubbing and scratching could cause the fiberglass fibers on top of your skin to become splinters embedded in your skin. It is best to let water run over your skin and let the fiberglass be washed off that way.
After you are done working with the fiberglass, wash your hands well and immediately remove your clothing for washing. Wash clothes that have been exposed to fiberglass separately from other clothing.Pants and long-sleeve shirts are the best option for protecting your skin. This will lower the chances of the fiberglass irritating your skin and slivers getting into your skin.
Flush your eyes with cool water for at least 15 minutes if you accidentally get fiberglass slivers in them. Do not rub your eyes. Seek medical attention if the irritation continues after this wash.

Use a pair of tweezers to grab the glass.,
Poke the glass out with a needle if it is fully embedded.,
Soak the splinter area in baking soda and warm water to loosen the skin.",How to Remove Glass from a Wound1," When only a small portion of glass is found in the wound, it can be easily removed at home.


Carefully pull it in the direction from which it entered.
Use tweezers that are sharp.
Don't apply too much pressure to the glass shard to avoid crushing it into smaller pieces.
If you don't have a steady hand, try having a friend remove the glass.
After removal, thoroughly wash the area with soap and running water.;
, If the glass is fully embedded in your skin, tweezers will be unable to grip its surface.


Use a small needle dipped in alcohol to remove the splinter.
Before removing the splinter, make sure that the area is cleansed using an antiseptic solution such as alcohol or betadine.
With the help of the needle, you can carefully and gently dislodge the glass.
Then you can fully remove it with a pair of tweezers.
After, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water.

, If you can’t remove the glass with tweezers or a needle, soak the area in a solution of one tablespoon of baking soda in warm cup of water.


This should be done twice a day.
Soaking will soften and loosen the skin, and draw the splinter to the surface.
The glass may eventually work its way out of your skin after several days.

Seek immediate medical attention if any of the following signs are present.,
Get medical assistance if a child has a glass wound.,
Go to the doctor if you fail to remove glass at home.,
Get a professional diagnosis.,
Understand the method by which a doctor will remove the glass.",How to Remove Glass from a Wound2," Although getting a small glass splinter can usually be handled at home, there are circumstances under which medical attention is warranted.


If the glass or the splinter is found under a fingernail, it will be difficult to remove without medical tools. This should be removed right away because it can cause the presence of infection.
If you experience the formation of pus, unbearable pain (8 out of 10 on the pain scale), tenderness, swelling, or redness you may be suffering from an infection and need antibiotics prescribed by a doctor.
If the glass shards are exceptionally large, they might affect sensation or movement and it could even cause nerve and blood vessel damage.
If you have previously removed glass from the wound, but the area is inflamed, there may be fragments retained under the skin that should be examined by a doctor.

, It can be difficult to remove glass from a child's wound, because they have a much lower tolerance for pain.


Children may move around and cause themselves further injury during the removal process.
This is why it is best to have the glass removed by a doctor or other medical professional.
Having the child in a safe and controlled environment will expedite removal and make it much less risky.

, Deeply embedded glass should be removed from a wound by a doctor to prevent further injury, especially if you crush it by mistake.


Sometimes when you try to remove glass at home, it can break into smaller pieces and fragment within your skin.
In case this happens and there are fragments left, go to the nearest emergency department right away so that a doctor can remove what is left.
Additionally, if glass is deeply embedded in the skin an anesthetic agent must be applied to ensure a painless removal.

, Most glass in found in wounds is clearly visible and doesn't require any diagnostic testing, but sometimes glass is embedded so deeply that it can't be seen from the skin's surface.


In cases where the glass is embedded deeply, an ultrasound, CT scan, or an MRI is usually ordered to provide a better view of the affected area.
Large splinters or glass shards that have deeply penetrated require a CT scan or an MRI to determine if has caused damage to your bones, nerves, or blood vessels.
An x-ray might also be ordered to determine the location of the splinter within you before removal.

, If you need to have the glass removed by a medical professional, it can be helpful to be aware of the procedure you are likely to undergo.


A surgeon will usually make an incision from the point where the glass entered.
A surgical clamp will be used to carefully spread the surrounding tissue.
Glass from your wound can then be removed using either alligator forceps (basically surgical tweezers).
If the glass has penetrated too deeply, the tissue will have to be dissected in order to access it for removal.

Bathe in warm water.,
Coat with a mild cooking oil.,
Apply ice to the bandage residue.",How to Remove Bandage Adhesive from Skin1," Warmth and moisture tends to make the adhesive in many bandages more pliable.One convenient way to soak the sticky area in warm water is to simply take a bath or shower. The adhesive may come off on its own, or may need a little gentle scrubbing from a washrag or mild abrasive pad.


If you don't have time to take a bath or shower, just fill a bowl or pan with warm water and soak the affected area. This works best if you can let the adhesive soak for a long time. Try this remedy while you're reading or watching television.;
, A few drops of olive, canola, vegetable, coconut, or sunflower oil can help remove adhesive from the skin. Some adhesives dissolve in oil. Others lose their grip when the oil finds its way between the glue and the skin.For best results, work the oil into the affected area with a little gentle action from a soft rag or cotton swab. You don't need much — your goal is to lightly coat the skin, not drench it. Let the oil soak for a moment or two before rubbing gently with a soft towel or cotton ball. Repeat as needed to get all the adhesive off.

, Cover the ice with a paper towel to prevent it from sticking to skin and leave in place for five minutes. The ice will make the adhesive brittle, which may cause it to release."
"
Soak residue with baby oil.,
Apply a gentle lotion.,
Use a warm compress in combination with baby oil, lotion, or some form of cooking oil.",How to Remove Bandage Adhesive from Skin2," Baby oil works using the same principles as cooking oils, either by dissolving the adhesive or releasing its grip upon skin. An added benefit is that most baby oils are made to be especially gentle, making this a great choice for delicate skin.


Most baby oils are simply mineral oil with a small amount of scent added. You can use pure mineral oil as an alternative to baby oil — often, it is slightly cheaper.
If you're removing adhesive from a child's skin, try adding a drop of food coloring to the baby oil and using it to ""paint"" the affected area. The oil will remove the adhesive and the coloring will provide a fun distraction., Since most lotions have an oil or lipid (fat) base, they can work for removing adhesive just like baby oil or cooking oils. Rub in a small amount of lotion, let it sit for several minutes, and rub with a gentle towel or cotton ball.


Unscented lotions are best. The chemicals used for added fragrances can sometimes cause pain and rashes on irritated skin., Since warmth loosens many of the adhesives used in bandages, you can use it to make these materials more effective. Warm water will wash off the oil or lotion, so use a warm compress instead. Our article on warm compresses details several easy ways to do this.


Try filling a tube sock most of the way with dry, uncooked rice. Tie a knot in the open end to keep the rice in. Microwave the compress in 30-second increments until it is warm, but not too hot to handle. Hold the compress over the adhesive as you let the oil or lotion soak in.
Place a rag between the compress and the skin if you are worried about getting the sock greasy.

Apply rubbing alcohol.,
Moisten with nail polish remover.,
Coat with petroleum jelly.,
Employ a pharmacy-grade adhesive remover.These products are specially designed to remove the types of adhesives found in bandages.,
Rinse with soap and water after using a chemical solution.",How to Remove Bandage Adhesive from Skin3," Also known as isopropyl alcohol, this common household cleaner is inexpensive and can usually be found at grocery and discount stores. Rubbing alcohol is very effective at dissolving some types of adhesive. Apply a small amount with a Q-tip or cotton ball, let it sit briefly, and rub gently to remove.


Rubbing alcohol can dry out and irritate skin, especially in delicate areas like the face. Use only a few drops at a time and allow your skin to rest between uses.

, The active ingredient in most nail polish removers is acetone, a chemical solvent. Acetone also works as a solvent for many common glues and adhesives, dissolving them on contact.Rub a small amount into the affected area and let it sit for a few moments, then continue rubbing gently to remove.


Acetone can have a similar drying or irritating effect on the skin as rubbing alcohol, so take similar precautions.
If you can find it, pure acetone works just as well as nail polish remover.
Exercise care in using acetone; it is a highly flammable substance and thus should not be used in combination with heat.Avoid using non-acetone nail polish removers as they will not contain the solvent required to dissolve the bandage residue.

, Products like Vaseline made out of petroleum jelly work like oils and lotions to remove adhesive from the skin. A unique benefit is that petroleum jelly is extra-thick, so it's easy to let it sit for a long time (though its greasiness makes this unpleasant for some). Simply work a thin layer into the affected skin and let it sit undisturbed for five to ten minutes, then wipe off with a gentle rag or paper towels.

, Adhesive removers are generally manufactured either as sprays or disposable wipes. They are a little more expensive and harder to find than the methods above, but they work especially well.


You may be able to find these products at your local pharmacy. If not, a wide variety are available for order online. Prices vary from product to product but typically range between $10–$25 per bottle or package., Many chemical products (especially rubbing alcohol, acetone, and some adhesive removers) can irritate the skin if they are in contact with it for too long. To avoid this, make sure to wash the area with soap and water after each use of these chemicals. This will help remove them from the skin and reduce irritation.


If you aren't able to get all of the adhesive off your skin at once, consider waiting a day before you repeat use of a harsh chemical again. The break will give your skin a chance to rest and recover. Alternatively, combine a chemical treatment with one of the gentler solutions.

Don't panic!,
Understand why your tongue it stuck to the metal.,
Make noise so someone can come to your aid.",How to Remove a Tongue Stuck on Frozen Metal1," The worst thing you can do is rip your tongue off the metal in a panic. This could give you a serious injury. Instead take a moment to think about your situation clearly. Assess whether you have someone near who can help you.


If you have someone with you, make sure they know that you are not joking and that your tongue is really stuck.;
, Basically, your tongue is stuck because your saliva is frozen solid. The reason this happens so quickly on metal, and not on other surfaces, is that metal is a great conductor.In order to unstick your tongue, you will need to warm up the metal above freezing temperature.


When you make contact with the metal, it sucks the heat out of your saliva rapidly so that the surface it is in contact with becomes the same temperature, which is called thermal equilibrium. This happens so quickly that it doesn't give your body a chance to make up the difference in heat., It will be easier to get your tongue unstuck if you have someone to help you. Once you get someone's attention, tell them to bring warm water and then have them poor it slowly over your tongue.


Don't let embarrassment get in the way of getting help. Your situation may be embarrassing but it's better to deal with a little embarrassment than an injured tongue.

"
"
Use warm water on the tongue and metal.Pour it slowly over your tongue, making sure to get the warm water in the area of contact between the metal and your tongue.,
Use your free hands to gently free your tongue.,
Breathe in deeply and then blow out hot air over your tongue.",How to Remove a Tongue Stuck on Frozen Metal2," This should raise the temperature of the metal, allowing your saliva to unfreeze.


You also want to make sure that the water is not too hot. No need to add a burn on your tongue to your list of problems!
Don't pour the water too fast. Pour it slowly and steadily, so that the warmth works its way into the frozen connection.

, If your tongue is only lightly frozen to the metal, you can gently pull it off. However, if this process begins to hurt your tongue, stop and find a different solution.


Try to twist your tongue and pull it off; hopefully this will cause your tongue to become unstuck.

, Let the hot air move out repeatedly until your tongue becomes unstuck. You may need to cuff your hands around your mouth, so that the hot air stays around your tongue.


Do this multiple times until the metal warms up enough to unfreeze your tongue.

"
Remain calm.,
Cup your hands around your mouth to heat up the surface.,
Pour warm liquid onto the surface.,
Call 911.,
Pull quick and fast.",How to Remove a Stuck Tongue from a Frozen Surface1," The most important thing you can do is to stay calm. If you’re alone, this can be hard to do, but give yourself a moment to take a few deep breaths and relax.Try to avoid panicking when you realize you’re unable to move away from the frozen surface. If you pull too hard on your tongue, it will literally rip off the frozen surface and cause a lot of damage (and bleeding). Consider this a last resort option.
If you see someone in the general area, try to flag them down by waving your arms or yelling (as best you can). Having someone else to help you will ease your stress.;
, Since you’re alone, try this method first. The reason why your tongue is stuck is because the metal surface is frozen and is conducting the heat from your tongue. In order to get unstuck, you have to warm up the metal somehow.One way to warm up the metal surface is to use your own hot breath. Cup your hands around your mouth (but be careful not to touch your lips or hands to the metal surface, as they will collect moisture and also become stuck) and breathe hot air directly onto the area where your tongue is stuck.
You can also use a scarf or jacket to shield yourself from a cold wind and possibly help warm air from your breath.
Pull gently while doing this to see if you can loosen, or even remove, your tongue.

, If, by some chance, you have a warm cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, or other liquid with you, use it to warm up the metal’s surface. Pour the liquid onto the metal where your tongue is stuck and gently attempt to remove your tongue.Warm water is ideal for this situation, but any warm liquid will work if necessary.
And yes, that includes urine. Although not recommended, if you are alone somewhere and no help is possible, this could be your absolute last resort. Consider this only under absolute emergency situations.

, Calling 911 to get help is definitely an option you should consider. Of course, this would only work if you have a cell phone with you, and that cell phone is easily accessible to you.When, and if, you call 911 you may be unable to talk to the operator. Remain calm and slowly try to explain what has happened and where you are. If necessary, they can trace your call to find you.

, Consider this as an absolute last resort option if all other options have failed or aren’t possible, but it really should never come to this. This option will, without a doubt, cause some sort of injury and be extremely painful. Build up your courage and then just yank yourself away from the frozen surface.


Warming the surrounding metal area through breathing and shielding yourself from wind with a scarf or jacket is usually enough to gently remove the appendage, even in -40°F or more.
Once you’re unstuck, seek medical help as quickly as possible for your injured tongue.

Tell the person to remain calm and not to pull.,
Make sure the person is otherwise okay.,
Ask the person to breathe deeply.,
Get some warm water.,
Call 911.",How to Remove a Stuck Tongue from a Frozen Surface2," Wet tongues at body temperature stick to frozen metal surfaces because the metal literally draws the heat out of the tongue. When heat is drawn out of the tongue, saliva becomes frozen and sticks to the metal surface like superglue. In addition, textured taste buds on your tongue strongly grip the metal surface.Due to the intensity with which the tongue sticks to the frozen metal, pulling lightly on the tongue to remove it will not work.
Pulling really hard on the tongue will only end up leaving a portion of the tongue stuck to the metal and the person bleeding profusely.
If you come across someone who has managed to stick his tongue to a cold metal surface, tell him to try to remain calm and not to pull on his tongue as it will only cause damage.

, Unless you witnessed the person sticking her tongue to the metal surface, you may not know what happened. Check her to make sure she's otherwise okay and not injured in other ways.If she has been hurt or injured in other ways, and those injuries are not minor (e.g. bumps or bruises) you should call 911 immediately.

, If you can warm up the metal, the tongue may naturally become unstuck. On way to attempt this is to ask the person to breathe on the metal as much as possible, while cupping his hands around his mouth to direct the hot air.You can even try to shelter the metal surface to help warm it up and contribute to the hot air being blown onto the surface.
Be careful that the stuck person doesn’t also stick his lips or hands to the metal surface, as this will just make the situation worse.

, If you live nearby, or have access to a hot water tap, get a glass or bottle filled with warm (not hot) water. Pour that warm water onto the person’s tongue where it’s stuck to the metal. At this point you can tell the person to slowly pull away from the metal surface to detach her tongue.If you are not able to get warm water, and hot air hasn’t worked, you may have to call 911 for help.
The liquid doesn’t necessarily have to be water. If you, or someone else passing by, has a warm cup of coffee, tea, etc., this will work as well. It just might be a little messier., Unfortunately, if neither hot air nor warm water works, you’ll have to call 911. If you live in a part of the world that experiences cold every year, emergency responders are likely use to dealing with tongues stuck to frozen metal surfaces."
"
Wash your hands.,
Sit up with your head tilted forward.,
Stop the bleeding.,
Keep steady pressure on your tongue for 15 minutes.,
Reduce pain and swelling with ice.,
Rinse regularly with salt water.,
Protect yourself from the cold.,
Be careful of what you eat.,
Take medications if needed.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Remove a Stuck Tongue from a Frozen Surface3," Since you need to use your hands to stop the bleeding, it’s best if you can clean your hands first. Obviously this will be more difficult if you’re attempting treatment where you were injured.Alternatively, use protective medical gloves if you happened to have some, or they’re accessible nearby.
Avoid using your bare hands directly on your tongue to stop the bleeding, if possible.

, You do not want to swallow any blood if possible, as this will just cause you to get nauseous and vomit. Instead, sit up with your head tilted forwards and downwards so the blood will drain out of your mouth.If you had anything in your mouth at the time of the injury, remove it now (e.g. gum).
If you have a piercing in or around your mouth, and you can safely remove it, do so.

, Use a clean cloth, or the cleanest cloth you have available, to apply pressure to your tongue. Only use your bare hands to apply pressure if you have nothing else to use, especially if you weren’t able to wash your hands first.Because it’s winter and you’re likely outside, a scarf or hat might be useful. But try to avoid using gloves or mitts as they’re most likely filthy.
Any cut or laceration of your tongue is going to bleed a lot because your tongue (and the rest of your mouth) contain a lot of blood vessels. This, however, can also be beneficial as the increased number of blood vessels also speeds up healing of the area., Do not let go of whatever material you’ve put on your wound for a minimum of 15 minutes. Use your watch or a clock to make sure you’ve keep constant pressure for a full 15 minutes. Do not be tempted to lift the material up to check if the wound is still bleeding.If blood soaks completely through the material you’re using, apply another piece of material on top of the existing one without removing it (or decreasing pressure).
Most mild bleeding will slow down significantly after 15 minutes, but the wound may still continue to bleed lightly for another 45 minutes.
If the wound is still bleeding profusely after 15 minutes, call 911 or go to the emergency room.
Avoid exercising for several days after your accident. Exercising, or exerting yourself, raises your blood pressure and can cause the wound to start bleeding again.

, Granted, under the circumstances, the last thing you may want to do is put ice in your mouth, but it does help. Instead of ice, you can also use a cold compress (e.g. a clean face cloth run under cold water).For ice, you can use it two different ways. One way is to simply suck on an ice cube or ice chips. Another way is to wrap the ice in a thin (clean) cloth and apply the cloth to the wound on your tongue.
Use the ice or cold compress method for one to three minutes at a time, six to ten times per day, for at least the first day.
Ice, or cold, will not only reduce swelling and stop any additional bleeding, it will help reduce the amount of pain you feel.You can also use a popsicle or something similar in lieu of ice if you prefer.

, Mix up a solution of salt water using 1 teaspoon of salt for every cup of water. Use the salt water solution to rinse out your mouth by swishing the water around inside your mouth, then spitting it out. Don’t swallow the salt water.Don’t start the salt water rinse until the day after your injury.
Use the salt water solution at least after each time you eat, but up to four to six times a day.

, While your tongue (or lips) are healing, you may be more susceptible to frostbite or chilblains (skin sores or bumps) in those areas. Protect yourself from the cold with a scarf, gloves, or balaclava to cover your face while you heal.

, Your tongue and mouth will not only be sore, but most likely quite sensitive. Try to eat only soft foods that are gentle on your mouth at first. Avoid any foods that are salty, spicy or have a high level of acid, as these may be painful to eat.Foods to consider eating are: milk shakes, yogurt, ice cream, cottage cheese, eggs, tuna, smooth peanut butter, and well-cooked or canned vegetables and fruits.
Do NOT smoke or drink alcohol while your tongue is healing.
You may wish to avoid mouthwash that contains alcohol while you’re tongue is healing, as that may sting quite a bit.

, If you have gone to see a doctor, they will advise what medications you should or can take. Follow their instructions explicitly. If the injury wasn’t serious enough to see a doctor, you can consider taking over-the-counter pain medications to help reduce any discomfort.Over-the-counter pain medications that may work would include acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol), ibuprofen (i.e. Advil) or naproxen (i.e. Aleve). The generic and brand name versions of all these medications are readily available in any pharmacy and most grocery stores.
Always follow the instructions on the package for over-the-counter medication, and speak to your pharmacist if you have any questions.
If you are pregnant, or might be pregnant, do not take ibuprofen or naproxen.

, If one or more of the following things occur, consider going to your doctor as soon as possible to have your wound checked:


If the pain from your wound increases over time, instead of getting better
If your tongue, or other parts of your mouth, start to swell
If you develop a fever
If you have trouble breathing
If the wound won’t stop bleeding, or opens up and starts bleeding profusely again

"
"
Clean the wound.,
Check the wound for the staple.,
Pull the staple straight out.",How to Remove a Staple from Your Hand1," Wash the wound for five minutes under cold water using antibacterial soap to remove obvious dirt from the area and to help avoid infection. You could also use mild dish detergent soap such as Ivory or Joy.Avoid using hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, or iodide as these can actually slow healing., Look to see if the staple is still intact and that no parts of the staple, including any of the adhesive that holds the stick of staples together, have broken off in the wound., Try to pull the staple out in the same angle as it appears to be lodged into the wound. It should come out fairly easily; however, if it does not pull directly out or appears to be stuck or bent, seek medical attention, as you can cause more damage to the surrounding tissues as you pull it out.


For a light staple, use tweezers. Heavier staples (such as those used on wood, of for bigger stacks of paper) may require the use of needle-nose pliers. Whatever you use, dip the tweezers or needle-nose pliers in a rubbing alcohol solution before bringing it anywhere near your wound.
If you find the tweezers or pliers pinching the skin because the staple is flush against the skin, wedge out the staple a little bit with a flat, firm item like a nail file. Again, make sure to dip the nail file or other flat, firm item you selected in rubbing alcohol first.

"
"
Stop the bleeding.,
Use an antibiotic.,
Consider the use of a bandage.,
Keep it elevated.,
Use pain medicine if necessary.",How to Remove a Staple from Your Hand2," If the wound is bleeding, let it do so for about five minutes, as this can help remove infection-causing materials from the injury site., Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment or cream, such as Neosporin, to the wound. If you develop a rash, stop using the ointment., Most puncture wounds will heal nicely without the use of a bandage; however, use a bandage if your wound is still bleeding or has a visible opening. The bandage will protect the wound from becoming dirty and irritated.Be sure to wash the wound with soap and water before applying the bandage. Change the bandage at least once a day or whenever it becomes wet or dirty., If you experience pain, use a pillow to keep the injury elevated above at or above the level of your heart anytime you are standing or sitting down. This will help reduce swelling., Take an over-the-counter pain medication such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and aspirin to also relieve the pain. Do not take more than the recommended dosage.


For ibuprofen the dosage is 400 to 800 mg three to four times daily (max 3,200 mg/day). For acetaminophen the dosage is 650 mg every four to six hours (max daily dose: 3,250 mg daily).
Do not give aspirin to anyone under the age of 19 unless you have permission from a doctor, as it may cause a serious condition known as Reye's syndrome.One side effect of chronic use of pain medications is that it can lead to gastric ulcers. Make sure that you do not take them for a prolonged time period.

"
"
Examine the wound and the surrounding area.,
Call 911 and apply steady pressure if you are bleeding severely.,
Call your doctor or seek prompt medical treatment for moderate bleeding.,
Seek medical treatment for mild bleeding accompanied with severe pain.,
Get medical care immediately if you are experiencing severe pain.,
Determine the urgency of moderate pain.,
Know that mild pain can be serious as well.",How to Remove a Staple from Your Hand3," You need to first determine if the staple is still embedded in the wound and if any blood vessels, nerves or tendons were damaged by the staple.This will help you determine if you will need a tetanus shot.


A tetanus shot might be needed if you received your last tetanus shot over 10 years ago, or if the staple was dirty or possibly dirty and you received your last tetanus shot over five years ago., If the bleeding is severe, you will notice any of the following: blood is pumping from the wound, or the bleeding does not stop or slow down when applying pressure. You may also be bleeding so profusely that the blood is soaking through one bandage after another.If this is the case, call emergency services for assistance.

, Be sure to seek medical treatment within an hour. With moderate bleeding, the bleeding slows or stops with pressure but starts again once pressure is no longer applied. The blood might also soak through a few bandages, but the bleeding isn't fast or out of control. You need to call an ambulance if you or someone else cannot safely drive you to the doctor or hospital, or if heavy traffic will delay your treatment., You should seek medical treatment within one hour. With mild bleeding, the bleeding either stops by itself or when you apply pressure. The bleeding may also stop or slow down to an ooze or trickle after applying pressure for 15 minutes.The bleeding can ooze or trickle for as long as 45 minutes.You should call for an ambulance if you or someone else cannot safely drive you to receive medical treatment, or if heavy traffic will delay your travels.

, Chances are that your injury will only get worse, so you need to contact your doctor or seek medical treatment within one hour.


If the pain makes it unsafe for you or someone else to drive, call an ambulance.

, Seek medical help if you have moderate pain lasting for longer than eight hours, and you’ve been injected with a high pressure item containing substances such as oil or paint., Seek medical help if you have mild pain lasting for longer than eight hours, and you’ve been injected with a high-pressure item containing substances such as oil or paint."

Remove the splinter on your own.,
Use tweezers to pull out the splinter.,
Access fully embedded splinters with the help of a needle.,
Wash the area thoroughly.",How to Remove a Splinter Under Your Fingernail1," Splinters that are deep under your nail, or have already become infected, may need to be removed by a doctor. You can tell a splinter is infected if it continues to be painful after a few days and the area around the splinter is swollen or red in color.If the splinter is causing serious and excessive bleeding, go to your local emergency room to have it removed.
If the splinter is embedded under your nail such that you are unable to reach it on your own, or if the skin around the splinter is infected, make an appointment to see your family doctor. The doctor can remove the splinter and give you antibiotics.
In most cases, the doctor removing your splinter should be able to give you a local anaesthetic to numb the area and reduce the pain of removal.
Be aware that a doctor may have to remove some or all of your nail in order to remove the splinter completely.;
, If you are going to remove the splinter on your own at home, you will most likely need a set of tweezers (as the splinter will probably be too small to grip with your fingers). If the splinter is embedded so far under your nail that no part of the splinter is above your skin, you may also need to use a needle to remove the splinter.Sterilize any equipment you are planning to use to remove the splinter. You can sterilize tweezers and needles using rubbing alcohol or boiling water.
Wash your hands before touching any sterilized equipment.
Wash the area and nail where the splinter is located before attempting to remove it in order to help prevent infection. If it is difficult to wash with soap and water, you can also use rubbing alcohol.
If you have long nails, you may wish to cut back the nail under which the splinter is embedded before attempting to remove it. This should allow you to see the area better.

, Find a location with enough light to property see the entire area where the splinter is located. Use the tweezers to grab the exposed portion of the splinter. Once you have a firm grip on the splinter, pull it out of your skin in the same direction it went in.Splinters may consist of more than one piece of wood, glass, etc. Or they can break when attempting to remove them from the skin. If you are unable to remove the entire splinter on your own, you may need to see your doctor to have any remaining portions removed.

, Some splinters under a nail may be so deeply embedded that no portion of the splinter is exposed above the skin. These types of splinters can be quite difficult to remove on your own, but you can try using a needle to expose a portion of the splinter in order to grip it with tweezers.Any type of small sewing needle can be used in this procedure. Make sure it has been sterilized before use.
Push the needle under the nail, towards the end of the splinter, and use it to pry out the end of the splinter.
If you are able to pry enough of the splinter out, grip it with the tweezers and pull it out in the same direction it went in.

, After you have removed some or all of the splinter, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water. After the area is washed, you can apply some antibiotic ointment (e.g. Polysporin) to help prevent an infection.You may also wish to place a bandage over the area if it is bleeding, or if it is located in a spot that might get infected in the future.

, Instruct your child to stay calm and tell him that the process can be a little painful but will subside after the splinter is removed. If possible, have someone hold your child during the removal process, as children tend to squirm when they are in pain.

, In order to make this process as efficient as possible, collect all of your materials before you begin. You will need:


Cotton balls soaked in alcohol.
Tweezers.
A magnifying glass.
A small bowl with alcohol in it.
A puncture proof container for discarding the splinter.

, Do this by soaking the tweezers in a small bowl filled with alcohol. Let the tweezers soak for five minutes to make sure that they are completely disinfected.


While waiting, clean the punctured area with cotton balls soaked in alcohol. Work from the inner part of the wound to the outer part of the wound to minimizer the spread of bacteria. This maneuver prevents dirt and other microorganisms from getting into the punctured wound.

, Locate the protruding part of the splinter. You can also ask someone to hold the magnifying glass for you.


When you are able to locate the protruding part clearly, get the tweezers.

, Slowly grab the tip of the splinter with your tweezers using your dominant hand. Slowly pull the splinter away from you. The direction should be opposite of the direction it went through the skin.

, Discard the splinter in the puncture proof container to avoid further accidents. Get a new cotton ball soaked in alcohol and put it in the punctured area. Apply firm pressure in the area for five minutes to stop the bleeding.

, Check out the angle and depth of the thorn to figure out how to remove it. Different methods are better for removing thorns at different angles and depths. See how close it is to the surface and whether a layer of skin has grown over it.


If the end is poking out, you might be able to remove it with tweezers or tape.
If it’s deeply embedded, drawing it out will be required.
If it's covered by new skin, you may need to use a needle or razor.

, If the thorn has been in your skin for a few days and you see signs of infection, see a doctor to get it removed. It's better not to attempt getting it out yourself, since you could further injure yourself. A doctor will be able to safely remove the thorn and dress the wound to cure the infection.


If it’s leaking pus or blood, go to the doctor.
If it’s itchy, red and swollen, go to the doctor.

, This is the easiest and quickest method if part of the thorn is sticking out. Make sure you use a clean pair of tweezers. Take tweezers and close the tips around the top of the thorn, then pull it out in the opposite direction of how it slid into your skin.


Make sure you know which direction to pull it out. If it's not obvious, you should start with a different method.
Don’t dig around with your tweezers if it’s in deep, since you could injure the area. Use a different method instead.

, Another great way to take it out if part of the tip is sticking out is to use a piece of tape. Just place a small piece of tape over the area. Lightly press it over the tip of the thorn, then remove the tape.


Don’t push too hard, or you'll press the thorn deeper into your skin.
Scotch tape or masking tape are fine, but avoid using tape that could leave a lot of residue and make matters worse.

, If the tip of the thorn is buried, use a drawing salve to help draw it out enough to expose the tip. When the tip is exposed, you can pull it out with the tweezers. This technique takes a little longer that others, but it works to remove thorns if new skin hasn't yet grown over the entry point.


Place ichthammol ointment (also called black drawing salve) on the area, then cover it with a bandaid. You could also use a little epsom salt.
Let it work overnight. In the morning, remove the bandaid and rinse it off. Pull out the thorn by its tip with tweezers.

, If you don't have ichthammol ointment on hand, this works, too. Make a thick paste with water and baking soda, and place it over the area with the thorn. Put a band-aid on it and let it work overnight. In the morning, remove the bandaid and rinse. The process will draw out the thorn so you can remove it with tweezers., The contents of a raw potato work the same way as a drawing salve, causing the thorn to rise to the surface of the skin. Cut fresh, raw potato open and cut a tiny slice. Place it over the affected area and hold it in place with a bandaid. Let it work overnight. In the morning, remove the bandaid and rinse, then pull out the thorn with a tweezer., Place white vinegar in a bowl, and soak the affected area. After 20 minutes or so, the thorn should work its way to the surface and emerge enough for you to pull it out by the tip. This is a good method for fingers or toes that can be submerged in a small bowl.

, Put some white school glue over the area and let it dry. As the glue dries, it will draw the moisture from your finger, causing the thorn to move toward the surface. When you remove the dry glue, the thorn will slide right out.Don’t use any other type of glue. Super glue and other heavy-duty glues could make it more difficult to remove the thorn.
This works best when the thorn is already close to the surface.

, If the thorn is just beneath a soft, thin layer of skin that has begun to heal over it, this method works well. However, it's important to follow the right technique so that you don't introduce bacteria to your skin and end up with an infection. Here's how to do it:Make sure the area where the thorn went in is clean and dry.
Sterilize a sewing needle by wiping it with rubbing alcohol.
Press the tip of the needle over the tip of the thorn and gently loosen the new layer of skin that grew there by digging the needle under the skin. Loosen the skin around the thorn.
When enough of the thorn is exposed, remove it with tweezers
Clean the area with warm, soapy water. Put a bandaid on if necessary.

, Thorns deeply embedded in thick, calloused skin can be removed with a razor. Only use this method for thick skin on your heels or another calloused area. Do not use this method on thinner skin, since you could easily cut yourself too deeply. If you wish to use this method, exercise extreme caution while handling the razor.


make sure the area where the thorn went in is clean and dry.
Sterilize the razor by wiping it with rubbing alcohol.
Very carefully make a cut over the thorn to expose it. In calloused skin, this should not draw any blood.
Use the tweezers to remove the exposed thorn.
Clean the area and bandage it if necessary.

, If the thorn is just too deep to remove on your own, or if it's close to a sensitive area like your eye, see a doctor for quick and clean removal. The doctor will have the right equipment to remove it easily with low risk of infection."

Soak the area in warm water and baking soda.,
Use tape to remove the splinter.,
Employ hair removal wax.,
Try “black drawing salve” to remove the splinter.,
Create a baking soda paste.",How to Remove a Splinter Under Your Fingernail2," Splinters that are deeply embedded under a nail, or are too small to grip with tweezers, may be able to be coaxed out using warm water and baking soda.Soak your finger in warm water mixed with one tablespoon of baking soda. You may need to do this up to twice a day for it to be effective.
It may take several days of this treatment before the splinter is close enough to the skin to be removed with tweezers, or for it to fall out on its own.

, Another removal option to consider is the use of tape. This method is rather simple. Place tape over the exposed portion of the splinter and then remove the tape quickly.The type of tape used is not important, however clear tape will allow you to see the splinter better if needed.
You may need to cut back the nail in order to get better access to the splinter.

, Very fine splinters may be difficult to grip with tweezers. Another option to remove these types of splinters under a nail is to use hair removal wax. Because the wax is in a viscous form, it should be easy to mould around the exposed portion of the splinter.You may need to cut back some of the nail involved in order to obtain better access to the splinter.
Apply the heated wax to the area around the splinter. Make sure all exposed portions of the splinter are covered.
Apply the fabric strip on top of the wax before it dries.
Grip the end of the fabric strip firmly and tear it off quickly.

, Otherwise known as ‘""ichthammol ointment,"" black drawing salve can be used to help remove splinters under your nail. You should be able to purchase the salve at a drug store (or online). The salve works to soften the skin around the splinter, which then helps to expel the splinter naturally.You may need to cut back some or all of the affected nail in order to gain better access to the splinter.
This method is also good to use on children, as it usually causes less pain and discomfort.
Apply a small amount of the salve to the area where the splinter is located.
Cover or wrap the area with a bandage and leave on for 24 hours. Black drawing salve can stain fabrics (clothing and bedding) so ensure the bandage covers the area such that the salve will not leak out.
Remove the bandage after 24 hours and inspect the splinter.
The purpose of the salve is to expel the splinter naturally. If the splinter still has not been expelled after 24 hours, but is more accessible, you can use tweezers to remove the splinter.

, Making your own baking soda paste is an alternative option to using black drawing salve. It is best to use this option only if all other options haven’t worked, as the paste may also cause swelling which will make the splinter harder to remove.You may need to cut back some or all of the affected nail in order to obtain better access to the area with the splinter.
Combine ¼ teaspoon of baking soda with water until it forms a thick paste.
Apply the paste to the area with the splinter, then apply or wrap a bandage around the area.
After 24 hours, remove the bandage and check the splinter.
The paste may be sufficient enough to allow the splinter to be expelled naturally. If 24 hours wasn’t enough time, you can apply another dab of paste for an additional 24 hours.
If the splinter is exposed sufficiently, you can use tweezers at this point to remove it.

Familiarize yourself with the concept of drawing salve.,
Explain the procedure to the child.,
Buy Ichthammol ointment or black drawing salve over the counter.,
Clean the wound.,
Apply the drawing salve.,
Put the band aid on the wound.",How to Remove Splinters in Children2," Drawing salve is an ointment that is used to treat different skin inflammations. Its main ingredients are ichthammol, arnica montana, phenyl alcohol and herbs such as Echinacea and calendula. It works by seeping into the tissue. Its most active ingredient, Ichthammol, can soften the skin by weakening it and increasing blood flow to the affected area. The increased blood flow results in the formation of pus around the foreign object. The pus and the foreign object are then ejected.


The drawing salve can normally work overnight but may also take as long as three days. This method is relatively painless.

, Instruct him to stay calm and tell him that the process is painless. Consider having someone hold the child while you apply the salve, as children tend to squirm.

, Prepare the necessary materials. You will need:


Cotton balls soaked in alcohol.
Band-aide.
Drawing salve.

, Clean the punctured area with cotton balls soaked in alcohol from the inner part of the wound to the outer part of the wound. This maneuver prevents dirt and other microorganisms from getting into the punctured wound. Let the wound air dry for about two minutes.

, Get the drawing salve and apply a small amount (about the size of your pointer finger) to the punctured area. Make sure to cover the entire punctured area.

, Get the band aid and put it over the drawing salve ointment and the punctured area. Wait for 24 hours. Instruct your child not to remove the band aid, even if it feels uncomfortable.


After 24 hours, the splinter is usually drawn out of the skin into the band aid.
Slowly remove the band aid and look for the splinter attached to it. If you see that the splinter is still in the skin, reapply the salve and place another band aid over the wound for 24 more hours.

Use the tweezers to pull the skin apart.,
Clean up.",How to Remove Splinters in Children3," This method can be used for a buried splinter that has lodged under thick skin like pads of the finger or heel of the foot.

, Instruct him to stay calm and tell him that the process can be a little painful but will subside after the splinter is removed. Consider having someone hold your child while you remove the splinter so that he doesn't move and cause himself more pain.

, For this method, you will need:


Cotton balls soaked in alcohol
Tweezers
Nail clipper
Small bowl with alcohol
A puncture proof container for discarding the splinter.

, Sterilize the tip of the tweezers and the nail clippers by soaking them in the small bowl of alcohol. Soak the tools for roughly five minutes.


While waiting, clean the punctured area with cotton balls soaked in alcohol. Work from the inner part of the wound to the outer part. This maneuver prevents dirt and other microorganisms from getting into the punctured wound.

, Get the sterilized nail clipper. Using your dominant hand, clip away the skin above the splinter in a parallel manner. This should not hurt as the skin is thick and not as sensitive.

, When the splinter is already visible, get the sterilized tweezers and pull the skin slowly apart so that you can gain more access to the splinter. Slowly grab the tip of the splinter with your tweezers using your dominant hand. Slowly pull the splinter away from you. The direction should be opposite the direction the splinter went through the skin.

, Discard the splinter in the puncture proof container to avoid further accidents. Get a new cotton ball soaked in alcohol and put it on the punctured area. Apply firm pressure to the area for five minutes to stop any bleeding.

Assess the wound.,
Don’t try to remove deep snags on your own.,
Don’t remove a hook near your eye.,
Use common sense.",How to Remove a Fishhook from Skin1," First, take a good look the wound and its location. Most fishhook injuries are soft-tissue injuries in the arms, head, or hands. These are fairly simple to treat when they are near the surface of the skin and don’t involve a complex hook or body part like the eye or eyelid.Where did the hook strike you? Your arm? Your hand? Your face? The location of the injury is important in deciding how to treat it.
Also check whether the wound is shallow or deep. Usually, it is possible to remove a hook that is embedded in your skin or just below the skin.;
, It’s generally safe to remove a superficially embedded un-barbed or simple hook on your own. However, deeper wounds will need proper medical care at a hospital or emergency care center.See a doctor or health care professional for fishhook injuries that are deep — i.e. in a joint, tendon, or muscle.
Don’t try to extract multi-barbed or treble hooks on your own, either. These are hooks with extra barbs on the shank or three, separate hooks. Trying to remove them may cause extensive tissue damage. Seek medical help, instead.

, Getting a fishhook in or near the eye can cause blindness and is a very serious injury. Do not try to remove the hook on your own. Instead, take proper precautions, such as not moving the hook, and try to get immediate medical attention.Leave the hook be. Touch it as little as you can and do not put pressure on the eye.
Protect the eye and hook with a cup to keep them from moving. A plastic cup, coffee mug, or any hard and clean concave object can work. Place the cup over your injured eye and hold it in place against your face.
Cover up the healthy eye, too, as the damaged eye will move along with it.

, Apart from the above, use common sense to decide if you should get medical help for your fishhook injury. Check your symptoms and, if in doubt, contact a doctor for advice.Seek medical help if you are bleeding severely, can’t stop bleeding, or if the wound is big enough to need stitches.
Consult a doctor if you feel tingling, numbness, or decreased mobility in the wound area. These are indications of deep tissue damage.
Seek help if the wound becomes red, swollen, or pus-filled, as these are signs of infection.

Find tweezers.,
Clean the area around the pin or tack.,
Examine the area with a magnifying glass.,
Pull it out with the tweezers.,
Wash the area with soap and water.,
Apply pressure to the wound with a cotton ball if there is any blood.,
Apply an antibiotic ointment and a bandage.,
Take over-the-counter pain medication.,
Get medical assistance if you cannot remove the pin or tack.,
See a doctor if the area appears infected or becomes painful.",How to Remove a Pin or Tack from Your Skin," You should always use tweezers to remove a pin or tack in your skin. Do not use your fingers, as your fingers can slip and cause the pin or tack to burrow deeper into your skin. Look for tweezers that have ends that meet exactly and are the same length.Sterilize the tweezers with rubbing alcohol to ensure they are clean. Put rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and rub it over the tweezers or soak the tweezers in rubbing alcohol before you use them.
If you do not have rubbing alcohol, then you can also immerse the tweezers in boiling water for a few minutes. Carefully retrieve the tweezers from the boiling water with a pair of metal tongs and allow them to cool before touching them with your bare hands.
If you do not have access to rubbing alcohol or boiling water, you can use some antibacterial soap and water to clean the tweezers.;
, If you are wearing any clothing, remove it so the area around the pin or tack is exposed. Then, put rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and rub the cotton ball on the area surrounding the pin or tack.You can also use soap and water if you do not have access to rubbing alcohol. Make sure you clean the area well. You do not need to soak the area with water. Simply clean it well.

, If possible, get a magnifying glass so you can examine the area up close. You should move into an area with good lighting so you can clearly see the pin or tack.Look at how deep the pin or tack is in your skin. If you can see the large end of the pin or tack just under the surface of your skin, you should be able to remove it with the tweezers.
If the pin or tack appears to be deeply embedded in your skin, you may need to go to your doctor for medical care. Visit your local physician or walk in clinic. If you cannot see the end of the pin or tack under your skin, it may be too deep for you to remove on your own and the medical professionals who treat you may even need to use an imaging device to find it.

, Use the tweezers to grasp the end of the pin or tack, flush with the surface of your skin. Make sure you get a good grip on the pin or tack with the tweezers before you pull it out.Look at the angle of the pin or tack in your skin. It may be at a straight angle or angled to one side. You should grasp and pull the pin or tack out as the same angle as it went in.

, Once you have removed the pin or tack, you should dispose of it in the garbage. Then, clean the area again with soap and water. If you have access to rubbing alcohol, you may also apply this using a cotton ball., If the pin or tack was not very deep in your skin, there should be little to no blood coming out of the wound once you remove the pin or tack. If there is blood, use a cotton ball to apply pressure on the wound until the bleeding stops.If there is a lot of blood coming out of the wound, you may want to consider seeking medical treatment. The pin or tack may have been deeper in your skin than it appeared.
Certain conditions may also put you at a higher risk for bleeding and infection. For example, if you are taking an anticoagulation medication, then you may need to see a doctor right away if the bleeding does not stop. You may also need to see a doctor right away if you have a condition that causes low platelets, also known as thrombocytopenia, or if you are immune compromised due to chemotherapy.

, Make sure you apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment onto the wound to prevent infection. You can also apply a bandage over the wound so it is protected from bacteria, especially if the wound is on your foot or your hand., If the area around the pin or tack is sore and uncomfortable, you may take over-the-counter pain medication. Always follow the dosage instructions on the label and only take the recommended amount of medication., You may not be able to remove the pin or tack because it is too deep in your skin. Rather than try to force the pin or tack to come out, you should go see a doctor.The doctor may then examine and assess the wound. They may remove the pin or tack themselves and then do an x-ray to make sure no part of the pin or tack is still stuck under your skin.The doctor may also ask you if you have had a tetanus shot in the last several years as well as where you were when you were injured and how the injury occurred.

, Keep an eye on the wound and watch for any signs of infection. If the area becomes swollen, very red, warm, or releases any pus, it may be infected. Also, note how the wound feels. If it appears infected or feels painful, then you should also see a doctor to have it looked at.Depending on the severity of the infection, your doctor may recommend antibiotics or a medicated cream you can apply on the wound.
Keep in mind that once an injury occurs the tissue is damaged and it will take time for it to heal. Generally, you should see some considerable improvement within two days to one week.

Rest the swollen area.,
Apply ice to the injury.,
Apply compression.,
Elevate the injured body part.,
Stretch when soreness subsides.",How to Reduce Swelling  for Minor Injuries1," Take time off and don’t put extra stress on the injury. If it’s lower-body, try not to stand or move too much. Don’t walk or run if it’s a joint (i.e. ankle, knee, hip).;
, The ice is cold enough to constrict blood vessels in the area and cause numbness.Use a bag of ice, or a cold compress. You can also grab something from the freezer, such as a bottle of water or bag of veggies, to reduce the swelling.


Do not use ice for more than 20 consecutive minutes. Tissue damage could be a consequence.Apply the ice multiple times per day for 2-3 days. Do not put the ice directly onto the skin. Use a towel or something similar as a buffer.
Apply the cold pack as soon as possible. Ice works best on recent injuries., Compression, or constricting the injured area with an elastic bandage (like an Ace bandage), will help decrease swelling. Be sure to research how to wrap specific injuries. For instance, when wrapping an ankle it is recommended to encircle the foot twice, and then move in a figure eight fashion around the ankle and foot while leaving the heel exposed.Don't wrap it extremely tight. This can cut off the blood supply. If you experience tingling, numbness, additional pain, or any swelling lower than the bandage, you may have wrapped it too tightly.
Loosen the bandage if it gets too tight.
Swelling is minimized in the area compression is applied.
Injuries often display weakness and need extra support provided by the wrap.
Bandages used for more than 2-3 days may point to a larger issue which needs medical attention., When the injury is elevated higher than the heart, gravity helps bring the blood back towards the heart, and it’s more difficult to pump towards the injury. Place the injury on some pillows or blankets to keep it comfortable., Be sure to keep flexibility in the injured area by remaining mobile. Work slowly and increase range of motion as far as you can progress."

Wash your hands before self-treatment.,
Apply downward pressure.,
Pull the hook backward.,
Dress and treat the wound afterward.",How to Remove a Fishhook from Skin2," If you’re removing the hook on your own, you need above all to keep the wound sterile and prevent infection. Before treating yourself, no matter what method, wash your hands with soap and water or a disinfecting solution. Wash the area around the wound, too, if you can.Wet your hands with running water and apply a liquid, bar, or powder soap. Work up a good lather with the soap and scrub for at least 20 seconds. Rinse with warm water., The retrograde technique is the easiest but least successful way to remove a fishhook. It works best with un-barbed or superficially embedded simple hooks, i.e. with a single barb at the end. Since the hook is near the skin’s surface, you won’t normally need an anesthetic for this procedure.With one hand, apply downward force to the shank of the hook, i.e. the mid-point of the curve. This should disengage the hook’s barb so that you can draw it backwards through the skin.
The force should be gentle. Your aim is to rotate the hook back only slightly.

, Once the barb is disengaged, slowly try to pull the hook backward through the skin along the path of entry. Ideally, it should slip out.


Do not continue to pull if you feel resistance. Stop and consider another method.
Pulling against resistance can tear or otherwise damage the skin and tissue.

, After you’ve removed the hook, always treat the area as you would any other puncture wound. This includes cleaning, dressing with antibiotics and bandages, and covering the wound.First, stop the bleeding. Then rinse the wound with clean water. If any dirt or debris remains, try to gently remove it with alcohol-sterilized tweezers. A little bit of hydrogen peroxide can also help to remove small amounts of debris with the foaming action
Apply antibiotic ointment to the wound, like Neosporin, and cover it with a loose-fitting bandage. The bandage will ensure the wound stays clean and free from bacteria.
Change the bandage once a day or whenever it gets wet or dirty.
Puncture wounds can cause a tetanus infection. For fishhook injuries, always call your doctor to make sure your tetanus inoculation is current. If not, you’ll need to get a booster shot within 48 hours.

"
"
Tie a string to the hook.,
Apply downward pressure to the hook.,
Pull on the string.",How to Remove a Fishhook from Skin3," The string-yank is a modification of the retrograde technique and is usually more successful. It also doesn’t normally require the use of a local anesthetic. The first thing that you’ll need to do is find some strong string, twine, or line.Use some fishing line or silk string, for instance. Regular dental floss can work as well.
Tie or loop the line around the shank of the hook and then secure the other end to one of your fingers. There should be at least one foot of line.
Wear eye protection like goggles if at all possible for this method, as the string-yank can cause the hook to fly free. You do not want a flying hook in the eye.

, As in the retrograde method, put light force on the back of the hook to disengage the barb. Gently press down on the shank with your index finger, or any free finger.


Remove your finger from the hook once you think that the barb is free.

, This next step may hurt a bit. The “yank” of the sting-yank method aims to disengage the fishhook from your skin by applying a modest amount of physical force. Pull in the slack on the line and then, with one strong tug, try to pull the hook free from your skin.Yank back at an angle of 30 degrees or so.
Don’t hesitate. Give it a good jerk and, with luck, the hook should exit along the path of entry.

"
"
Prepare the site.,
Grab hold of the hook.,
Advance the hook and remove the barb.,
Pull the barbless hook backward.,
Cut off the eye of the hook, alternately.",How to Remove a Fishhook from Skin4," The advance and cut method is more aggressive than the previous two and may involve higher levels of pain. For your comfort, and if available, apply a topical anesthetic to the wound site to dull any potential pain.Look for a topical gel, ointment, or cream. In the US, some brand names include Xylocaine, Lidoderm, Sting Kill, and Polar Frost.
As always, make sure that the wound area is clean and dry before application. Read and follow the anesthetic’s instructions for use and recommended dosages.

, The advance and cut method is nearly always successful. However, its main drawback is that it damages the tissue more than the retrograde and string-yank techniques. The hook should only be advanced if the point of the hook is already near the skin surface; otherwise additional damage to deeper structures can occur. Use a needle holder, hemostat, or needle-nose pliers to grasp the hook.

, Rather than just pulling out the hook along the path of entry, this method requires you first to push it forward through the tissue and out of the skin, then to remove the barb.


Wear goggles or some form of eye protection, as the barb is small and can fly when cut.
Push the hook forward until the barb emerges.
Next, take pliers, wire-cutters, or another cutting tool and clip off the barb from the fishhook.
Be sure to re-stabilize the hook before you cut it.

, With no barb, the fishhook will not tear or rip tissue as you remove it. You can now draw it out safely, as in the first two techniques.Slowly pull on the hook and guide it backward along the original path of entry and where you pushed it forward through the skin.

, There is a variant of the method that involves cutting off the hook’s eye rather than the barb. In this case, clip the eye after you have advanced the hook through the skin.


Then, continue to push the hook forward and draw it out, rather than pushing it backward through the original entry wound.

Get enough Omega 3 fatty acids.,
Eat pineapple.,
Boost your immune system.,
Eat foods with minimal Omega-6 fatty acids.,
Soak in some Epsom salts.",How to Reduce Swelling  for Minor Injuries2," Aside from having several supplemental health benefits like lowering heart disease risk, Omega 3 fatty acids can help with inflammation.They have been shown to not only quickly combat inflammation, but also keep chronic inflammation at bay., An anti-inflammatory enzyme called bromelain is in pineapple and helps to repair cells.It diminishes inflammation byproducts that makes it easier for the body to repair itself.Bromelain has been used to treat pain, inflammation in osteoarthritis, and inflammation in the joints., Found in veggies, whole grains, and legumes, complex carbohydrates are broken down by a bacteria called probiotics in the intestines. The result is an improved immune system that fights off inflammation., Oils like corn, soybean, and sunflower, as well as nuts and seeds, are high in Omega-6 fatty acids.Omega-6 acids are essential to diet, but lessening the amount of these acids can help minimize inflammation., Resting in Epsom salts has been shown to reduce minor swelling by releasing magnesium ions that fight the brain's pain receptors.Rest the injured area for 1-2 days, or longer if the swelling persists.

"
"
Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).,
Seek medical assistance for odd bruises.,
Gauge your pain.",How to Reduce Swelling  for Minor Injuries3," NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen, Advil, and Motrin ease pain and lessen swelling. People younger than 20 are at risk for Reye syndrome – a brain and/or liver condition that often causes intensive care – so don’t provide aspirin as a method to relieve swelling., When you have large, sudden, or frequent bruises, or if you have bruises for unknown reasons, particularly in the middle of your body or face, there may be a blood clotting problem. Similar concerns exist when you also have a history of easy bruising., If you have increased pain and swelling in the injured area, or if there is a lump in the same location, it may be more than a minor injury. Similar to unusual bruises, extraordinary pain for minor injuries could point to something much more significant.Go to the doctor if the level of pain does not correspond with the injury.
If the pain is still there after three days, the injury may not be minor, and you may need to see the doctor.

Call 9-1-1 under certain conditions.,
Bring your child to a pediatrician.,
Get an x-ray.,
Allow your doctor to remove the coin medically.,
Watch for symptoms at home in the aftermath.,
Do not use your fingers to attempt to remove a coin.,
Refrain from using techniques like the Heimlich maneuver on young children.,
Talk to your child about the dangers of swallowing a coin.,
Keep coins out of reach of young children.",How to React if a Toddler Swallows a Coin," It can be scary to learn your toddler swallowed a foreign object. However, the calmer you are, the better you'll be able to deal with the situation. In the aftermath, take a few deep breaths and then proceed to care for your child.


You also want to remain calm to keep your toddler calm. If a toddler is distressed, he may be difficult to keep still as you attempt to dislodge the coin.;
, Open your child's mouth and check to see if the coin is visible. If the coin is blocking your child's airway then it may or may not be visible in the back of his or her throat.If the coin is stuck, then the child may be drooling, crying, and/or having trouble breathing., If you act fast, you may be able to dislodge the coin while it's still in a child's esophagus. Take the child and hold him or her facedown on your forearm. From there, use the heel of your other hand to thumb the child firmly on the middle back.With luck, the combination of gravity and pressure should dislodge the coin.
If a child is choking, do not try this method. Instead, call 9-1-1 immediately.

, The majority of coins will pass through a child's digestive tract naturally and should not pose any threat. However, you need to make an appointment with your pediatrician to assure the coin is moving smoothly through a child's body and that is has not become lodged or stuck in the esophagus or intestines.


Call your pediatrician in the event the coin does not become dislodged, and make an appointment to evaluate your child's condition., You should call 9-1-1 instead of your pediatrician if this is a medical emergency. If your child displays any of the following symptoms, call 9-1-1 or take your child to the ER:Difficulty swallowing
Difficult breathing
Drooling
Vomiting
Problems going to the bathroom
Chest or stomach pain
Abdominal pain
Blood in the stool
Sepsis or infection

, You will want to see where the object is located in order to evaluate whether medical treatment is needed. Make an appointment with your pediatrician and explain what happened. The pediatrician will do a basic exam to evaluate your child and decide how to proceed., In the case of coins, an x-ray will be needed to determine where the object is located. If the coin seems to move through a child's digestive tract naturally, the doctor will likely want to watch and wait. However, if the coin is lodged, the doctor will need to medically remove the coin.If the x-ray is not being conducted immediately, ask your doctor how to prepare.
Make sure to keep your child calm before and after an x-ray. If a child has never had a major medical problem, an x-ray may be frightening. Make sure to hold your child's hand, sing to your child, read to your child, or engage in other activities to keep your child calm during the procedure.

, If the object is stuck somewhere in your child's body, medical removal may be required. Foreign objects are usually removed endoscopically in the stomach or, in rare cases, surgically if deeper than the endoscope can reach.An endoscopy involves pushing a special scope from the child's mouth to the stomach. Ask your doctor about how to care for your child before and after the procedure.

, After you doctor visits his or her pediatrician, follow up care may be necessary. Most children do not need follow up, and the object should pass on its own. You rarely have to examine your child's feces for the coin. However, if your child is suffering from symptoms like stomach pain, you may have to make a follow up appointment, or if severe, be assessed in the ER.If your pediatrician thinks the coin will pass on its own, you will need to check your child’s poop for the next few days until the coin comes out., If you see the coin was swallowed, you may try to intervene by swiftly trying to remove the coin using your fingers. This is a bad idea, as you could cause the coin to become lodged further in a child's throat., The Heimlich maneuver, and other techniques meant for adults, are not safe on young children. Never attempt to administer the Heimlich on a toddler, and do not use methods like abdominal thrusts or heavy blows to the back., If your toddler is old enough to understand basic instructions, talk to him or her about the dangers of swallowing coins. Let your child know he or she should not put anything but food in his or her mouth.


Ask your doctor how to talk to your child as well. A pediatrician may have advice or pamphlets on how to discourage children from swallowing foreign objects.

, Make sure you keep coins and other objects out of reach of young children. While some coins pass easily, complications can occur. You also want to save yourself the time and hassle of a pediatrician visit.In addition to keeping coins out of reach, keep other small items of your toddler's reach. Avoid giving your toddler toys with small parts.
Be especially careful about keeping batteries away from your child. These batteries are very dangerous to a child's digestive system and can cause serious problems if swallowed as the chemicals will cause the intestine to perforate. Magnets are also dangerous to swallow because they stick to each other and can cause necrosis of the intestines. They require surgical removal if swallowed.

Look for a sudden stop in motion.If someone suddenly stops in their tracks, or seems to “blank out” and become non-responsive, she may be having a petit mal seizure.Most petit mal seizures only last about 15 seconds, so don’t assume that someone didn’t have a petit mal seizure just because she stopped or froze up for a few seconds.,
Look for movements of the face and head.,
Stay aware of motor symptoms.,
Check for a response.,
Explore the person’s feelings.,
Respond appropriately.,
Consult a doctor.If you suspect you or your child may be having petit mal seizures, schedule an appointment with a doctor.,
Have questions for your doctor.,
Request medication.,
Eat a ketogenic diet.A ketogenic diet is low in carbohydrates and burns fat for energy.,
Get enough sleep.Many people who have seizures find that a lack of sleep increases the likelihood they will have a seizure.,
Seek support.",How to Recognize a Petit Mal Seizure,"


Petit mal seizures can stop as abruptly as they start. After it happens, the person who had the seizure will return to what she was doing and have no memory of having blanked out or had a seizure.If, for instance, someone was talking and suddenly had a petit mal seizure, she would continue her sentence after the seizure ended as if nothing had happened.;
, When a petit mal seizure strikes, the person might lick his lips or move his jaw up and down as if he is chewing.The jaw might also move from side to side.


In atypical petit mal seizures, you might notice the head bobbing up and down.Check for fluttering eyelids.If the individual’s eyelids are rapidly opening and closing, he might be having a petit mal seizure.
Blinking hard or excessively are also indications of a potential petit mal seizure.
During a petit mal seizure, the eyes may roll upwards or become unfocused.

, There are two types of motor symptoms: twitching and stiffening. These symptoms make it impossible for the person suffering the seizure to engage in normal motion. You might notice the muscles of the arms, neck, or legs tensing and then relaxing rapidly.


In certain rare cases, you might also notice bodily shaking during the seizure.
Jerking motions or small twitches could suggest that another type of seizure is occurring at the same time as the petit mal seizure., Absence seizures are often confused with daydreaming. If you don’t know whether someone is having an absence seizure or is just daydreaming, touch her gently on the arm. If she turns to give you her attention, she was just daydreaming., People with petit mal seizures do not experience a distinct feeling that a seizure is coming before the seizure strikes. This is in contrast to people who have complex partial seizures. Identifying whether or not someone has an “aura” (the feeling that a seizure is coming) can help diagnosis.If someone has many symptoms associated with a petit mal seizure, ask him when he comes out of the seizure whether he felt something strange or “off” just before he went into the seizure.
Complex partial seizures and petit mal seizures are often confused because they are quite similar.

, If someone is having a petit mal seizure, don’t try to rouse her or restrain her. This is unhealthy for the person having the seizure and might increase the length of the seizure. If she is in danger (for instance, if she is driving a car), take action to protect the person (by steering the to safety). Stay with the person having a seizure until it is over.


After the seizure is over, the person who had the seizure will not remember the event, and will resume what she was doing. Speak softly to the person who had the seizure and let her know what happened.
If she does not respond, or appears to be ignoring you, she might still be having a seizure.
The average absence seizure lasts 15 – 30 seconds. If they last longer, or if the person suffering the seizure has one after another in quick succession, it could be a sign of a more serious condition. In either case, call 911 and report a medical emergency.

, Share with him all relevant information.


The doctor might direct you to get an EEG (a simple procedure that measures brainwaves) to test for irregularities in your brainwave pattern.Your doctor may order a CT scan, which uses many x-rays to create an image of the head, including the brain. Your doctor can use this to look for scar tissue, masses or brain damage that might be causing the seizures.
You might also need an MRI. Similar to the CT scan, the MRI provides the doctor with a detailed image of your brain to help locate the cause and location of any issues in the brain.In addition, your doctor may also order blood tests to exclude other possible diseases and potentially help uncover the source of the seizures.

, In order to get you or your child the best possible care, you should use your time with your doctor to get specific information regarding care and management.For instance, you might want to ask:


What is the cause of these seizures?
Will I need medication to manage the seizures?
Can I continue to participate in normal activities like driving, playing baseball, and swimming?

, While there is no cure for seizures, there are several medications available that can minimize their frequency. Your doctor will prescribe the medication that’s right for you based on your medical history.Ethosuximide is the standard treatment for seizures.
Valproic acid is another useful seizure medication, but is not recommended for women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant.
Lamotrigine is the least effective seizure medication, but it also has the fewest side effects.
Always use the medication prescribed by your doctor as directed.
After two years without a seizure, most children can begin to reduce the amount of medication they need to take.

, The diet requires careful management of fat, carbs, and protein. Consult your doctor or a trained nutritionist to determine the best ketogenic diet for you or your child.


Life on a ketogenic diet can be difficult. Many foods that you or your child formerly enjoyed — cookies, macaroni and cheese, and soda — will be off-limits when on a ketogenic diet.
The ketogenic diet is also useful in cases where drug treatment proves ineffective.
It is unclear why a ketogenic diet work to reduce seizures, but one theory argues that when the liver burns fat for energy, certain compounds (known as ketone bodies) are produced that protect brain cells.

, Try to get at least eight hours of sleep each night.


Do not eat or drink within three hours of going to bed. This will help you sleep more soundly.
Before going to bed, do something relaxing that doesn’t involve a TV or computer screen. These screens can disrupt natural sleep patterns. Read a book or listen to a podcast.
Ensure you have a quiet, dark room at a comfortable temperature. Turn your mattress over regularly to keep it comfortable., Living with seizures can be a challenge. It is important to connect with others who are also struggling with petit mal seizures in order to avoid the social isolation that often accompanies their onset.By hearing what others who have had petit mal seizures go through, you'll feel less alone in your struggle with epilepsy.

Develop new coping skills.",How to Prepare Yourself for EMDR Therapy," EMDR therapy is not a one-time treatment. It utilizes an eight-phase approach to psychotherapy, and requires the patient to recall painful memories while the therapist guides her through a series of eye movements.Each set of eye movements lasts approximately 30 seconds, and is designed to replicate the mechanisms that take place during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep.EMDR therapy helps patients deal with a traumatic past, but it can also help cope with present circumstances and even plan for future events.Studies have shown that eye movements help disrupt working memory.The combination of exposure therapy and eye movement help the patient's brain process the traumatic memories. This changes the trauma from what's considered a ""stuck memory"" into a resolved learning experience, after which the patient is able to let go of the feelings of trauma.EMDR has a high rate of success, when patients complete the entire course of treatment.Some patients are able to process a single traumatic event in as few as three sessions, while other patients need 12 or more sessions to fully process an event.Every patient is different, and for maximum results you should adhere to your therapist's recommendations.;
, EMDR was originally designed to primarily treat PTSD, but the scope of treatment has expanded somewhat over time. There is some anecdotal evidence which suggests that EMDR may be useful in treating phobias and panic disorders, but researchers have failed to find any strong clinical success in the use of EMDR for these conditions.EMDR is most effective at treating PTSD and trauma from assault, combat, or life-threatening situations. However, EMDR ‘’may’’ be effective at treating other anxiety disorders, if those disorders originated in response to a traumatic incident.If you think EMDR therapy might be right for you, talk to your doctor or contact an EMDR-qualified therapist for a consultation.

, It is vital that therapists be formally trained in EMDR therapy. The memories brought up in EMDR therapy are often traumatic, life-threatening events, and it is imperative that the therapist knows how to properly administer treatment and help the patient cope with these memories. If the therapist is not formally trained in EMDR, the treatment could be ineffective, or even harmful.Ask your prospective therapist if he has received both levels of EMDR training, and whether that training was through an EMDRIA-approved institution.Ensure that the prospective therapist is up to date on the latest EMDR protocols and practices.Ask the prospective therapist how many cases he has treated with the problem for which you are seeking treatment, and what his success rate has been for those cases.To find a qualified EMDR therapist in the United States or Canada, visit the Psychology Today search engine at https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_search.php. You can search by state or province, then expand the “Treatment Orientation” tab on the left-hand side to search for EMDR treatment. If you live outside these regions, you can use an online search engine like Google to find EMDR therapists in your area.

, Before the actual EMDR therapy begins, the patient and therapist begin a period of preparation. This is important for the patient’s health and the success of the therapy, as the therapist teaches the patient various techniques to cope with the traumatic memories discussed during therapy. These techniques should ultimately help the patient to control or “soothe” her emotional response to the painful and traumatic memories that will arise during subsequent sessions.The preparation phase will vary, depending on the patient and her ability to manage the trauma. Many therapists feel that the patient is typically ready after one or two initial sessions, but the decision to move forward is at the discretion of the therapist. The end of the preparation phase will ultimately be determined by the perceived preparedness of the patient., Due to the rapid eye movements associated with EMDR therapy, patients’ eyes often become dried out during sessions. If you wear contact lenses, switch to glasses for your session, or bring a lens case and solution to your session so you can remove your contacts before you get started., In addition to removing your contact lenses, you may wish to bring eye drops to your session. Many patients experience dry, irritated eyes as a result of the eye movements associated with EMDR therapy.If you are prone to dry eyes, or if you are worried about experiencing dry eyes during a session, consider bringing some type of over-the-counter rehydrating eye drops, also known as artificial tears. These are available at most pharmacies and drug stores, and can help rejuvenate dry eyes or prevent them altogether.

, The point of EMDR therapy is to allow the patient to better process memories of a traumatic experience. In order to do this, you must be willing to confront those traumatic memories, which can be stressful, painful, and generally unpleasant. However, the advantage of EMDR therapy is that you can confront those memories in a safe and secure environment under the guidance of a trained professional.Anticipate some degree of distress, discomfort, or pain, especially in the early stages of treatment.

, Because EMDR therapy involves the evocation of painful or unpleasant memories, it is recommended that patients take the rest of the day off after a session, if at all possible. Some experts recommend trying to take a nap at home after the session ends. This is both to help soothe the patient after recalling upsetting memories, and to continue the processing that was begun during the EMDR session.If you can, try to schedule your sessions for days on which you will not have to return to work. It’s important to give yourself time immediately after your EMDR session to relax and process the emotions that arise during therapy., Many patients experience upsetting emotional responses for several days after a session, with some particularly strong responses lasting several weeks. These responses are normal, and should simply be recounted to your therapist at the start of your next session. Some patients experience extreme responses that trigger depressive episodes, and these incidents should be reported to the therapist immediately to ensure the safety of the patient.Common responses in the days after a session include:


feelings of insightvivid or upsetting dreamsstrong emotionsrecalling memories that had been blocked or forgotten, Studies have shown that patients who do not complete the full eight-phase course of treatment are more likely to lose the beneficial effects of treatment, or lack any significant benefits whatsoever.For this reason, it is imperative that you commit to the full course of treatment, if you or your therapist believes that EMDR treatments could help you.


Phase one - this phase of therapy involves the therapist taking down the patient's history. The therapist will then assess the patient's preparedness to progress, and will work with the patient to develop a treatment plan.Phase two - during the second phase of treatment, the therapist will work with the patient to ensure that she has multiple methods of coping with emotional pain and trauma. During this phase, the therapist may teach the patient different stress-reduction techniques and develop a plan to process disturbing emotions as they arise.Phases three through six - in these phases of treatment, the patient will identify some type of vivid visual imagery she associates with the traumatic memory, a negative belief she holds about herself, a positive belief she holds about herself, and any other emotions or sensations related to the memory. Sessions during these phases will focus on the use of eye movement. The therapist will also teach the patient to focus on the positive self-belief that she has identified.Phase seven - during phase seven, the therapist works with the patient to find some type of closure on the trauma. If the therapist has not done so yet, he will now begin asking the patient to keep a log throughout the week, and will work on instituting the self-calming and coping techniques from phase two for use at home when the patient is keeping her weekly log.Phase eight - in this (potentially) last phase, the therapist will review how much progress the patient has made and evaluate how to move forward., In many ways, the course of each EMDR session is determined by the patient. The patient is always left in charge of deciding how much to tell the therapist in a given session, and whether she feels comfortable continuing or would prefer to stop.But through it all, it’s important that you offer your therapist total honesty in everything you discuss.


If you need to stop or don’t yet feel comfortable proceeding on a certain topic, that is perfectly fine. However, in order to fully move past the trauma of the event, you will eventually need to open up about all aspects of the experience.As a patient, you have every right to withhold details or memories until you’re more comfortable revealing that information, but it’s important to know that prolonged withholding of information will extend the duration of the therapy, and may delay the healing process., Though the memories of trauma will continue to live on in the patient’s mind, a successful course of EMDR therapy should help reduce or completely eliminate the distressing symptoms that had previously accompanied those memories. Once the memory no longer causes flashbacks, panic attacks, or symptoms of trauma, the therapist and patient will begin to develop new coping skills to help process and live with those memories, as well as any future trauma that may arise."

Evaluate the wound.,
Insert a needle into your finger, following the entrance wound of the hook.The needle should follow an angle that is parallel to the hook, gently pushing down on the hook to make enough space for the needle to slide over it.,
Press the tip of the needle down to disengage the barb.Use the tip of the needle to cover the barb and then press down slightly so that it disengages from the tissue in your finger.

,
Pull the needle and hook out at the same time.",How to Pull a Fish Hook from Your Finger2," If the barb is not too deep in the skin or tissue of your finger, you may wish to try using a needle to ease the hook out. This works best on a large hook with a single barb.Don't forget to clean the area before attempting removal. Flush the wound with water to clear out as much dirt and debris as possible.

, You will use the tip of the needle to press down on the barb of the hook so that you can slide the barb out without it catching on your skin.


A sterile, 18-gauge or larger needle should be used if possible — this method may not work otherwise.You can sterilize the needle with rubbing alcohol. If you don't have access to alcohol, you can hold the tip of the needle into a flame (as from a lighter) until the metal glows red.

,, Slowly back the needle and hook out of the entrance wound.Both instruments need to be removed together, as the needle tip is keeping the barb from damaging the surrounding tissue. Make sure you are putting adequate pressure on the needle and hook."
"
Assess the wound.,
Attach fishing wire.,
Apply pressure to the hook.,
Distract the patient.,
Yank the string.,
Apply pressure.",How to Pull a Fish Hook from Your Finger3," Figure out how deep the hook is stuck in your skin. If the hook is stuck deep in the tissue, simply removing the barb and pushing the hook through will not work. If this is the case, you will need to an alternative method to remove the hook., If the hook is stuck in deeply, take a foot-long piece of fishing string and make a loop around the bend of the hook. Try to do this without moving the hook around too much. You don’t want the injury to hurt more or get the hook stuck in deeper because you were being careless., Hold string in one hand and push down on the eye of the hook with the other hand. Essentially, you are trying to keep the hook exactly where it is for the moment. Again, make sure you don’t push the hook in deeper when applying pressure to the eye of the hook., Whoever has the hook caught in his skin is not going to like what comes next. Have him focus on something else, look away, or tightly close his eyes. You may want to have the individual take a shot of alcohol, if available, to help take the edge off.

, Pushing down on the eye of the hook keeps the barb from ripping a much larger hole on the way out. While still applying pressure to the eye of the hook, yank as hard as you can on the fishing wire you attached to it. This will rip out a sizable chunk of skin, but the hook will come with it.Be aware the hook can spring out with a lot of speed. Make sure the remover and bystanders are as clear as possible from the trajectory of the removed hook.
Irrigate the wound as soon as the fish hook is removed by pouring clean water or normal saline on it. Let it bleed freely.

, Once the wound has been irrigated, make sure to hold pressure on or below the cut to stop severe bleeding. Make sure to apply pressure for five minutes to 30 minutes after ripping the hook out. If bleeding has not slowed by then, you may need to seek medical assistance."
"
Disinfect the wound.,
Wash the wound quickly.,
Get a tetanus shot.,
Monitor the wound.",How to Pull a Fish Hook from Your Finger4," Fish hooks are really dirty. They have been in pond or lake water, filled with bacteria, algae, pond scum and whatever else is living in there. Use a saline solution liberally on the wound to disinfect it immediately after getting the hook out.If you don’t have saline solution on hand, beverages with a high alcoholic content, like vodka or rum, will work in a pinch. This is not an ideal solution, but most fishermen are more likely to have alcohol on their boats than saline solution.Hydrogen peroxide has long been used to disinfect fresh wounds. However, recent studies have proven this product to be largely ineffective. Some studies even suggest that it can cause more damage to the injured area., You will want to rinse out the wound with cool water and antibacterial soap as soon as possible. If you don’t have these things on the boat with you, a bottle of drinking water is a temporary solution until you can reach medical supplies.Wash the wound out as soon as possible after the hook is removed. This will go a long way in avoiding infection.
Apply antibiotic cream and a bandage. Once you have disinfected and cleaned the wound, apply an antibiotic cream or ointment and attach a clean bandage to the wound. This will help kill any remaining bacteria and help to keep the wound free of dirt.Change the bandage often and allow the wound to breathe from time to time.You may need to get stitches is the wound is particularly deep., Fishing hooks are often rusty. Even if the hook doesn’t appear to be rusty, it can still carry tetanus bacteria. So get a tetanus shot. While no one likes getting shots, it is far better to err on the side of caution because the alternative is very unpleasant.You have 72 hours to get a tetanus shot after injuring yourself., Most injuries caused by fishing hooks, once sanitized, present very few problems. However, you will want to keep an eye on your wound to make sure it is healing properly. Some signs of infection to look for are:The wound is not healing
Swelling
Oozing or seeping fluids or blood
Warmth emanating from the wound
Throbbing at the wound site
Red streaks extending out from the wound site
If you notice any of these signs, seek immediate medical attention.

Check for breathing and consciousness.,
Consider possible spinal injuries.,
Position the arms and legs.,
Roll her over towards you.,
Open the airway.",How to Put Someone in the Recovery Position1," Before you decide to put someone in the recovery position, it’s important that you take a moment to assess the situation. Check to see if the person is unconscious, but breathing, and has no other life-threatening conditions. Talk to the person to assess if he is responsive. Check for breathing by placing your cheek near the nose and mouth of the person to feel his breath.


If the person is breathing and unconscious or semi-conscious, you can place him in the recovery position.;
, If you suspect the person has a spinal injury, do not attempt to move her until the paramedics arrive. If she is struggling to breathe and it is necessary to open her airway, place your hands on either side of her face, and gently lift her jaw upwards. Be careful not to move her neck. Spinal injuries may be present if the person:


Has suffered a head injury, a major blow to the back of the head, a fall from a height between five and ten feet, and is (or has been) unconscious.
Complains of severe pain in her neck or back.
Won’t move her neck.
Feels weak, numb or paralysed.
Has twisted her neck or back.
Has lost control of her limbs, bladder or bowels., Once you have established that it is safe to put him into the recovery position, kneel down to one side of him so you can position the arms. Place the arm nearest to you at a right angle to his body, so the elbow is towards you. The palm should be facing up and in front of the head.


Then take the other arm and place it across his chest. Tuck the hand under the side of his head, so the back of the hand is against the cheek.After positioning the arms, you should bend the knee of the leg farthest away from you, so the foot is flat on the floor., When you have positioned the arms and legs, you can gently roll her onto her side. Take hold of the raised knee, and carefully pull it towards you and down. Ensure that the hand you placed under the head stays there and supports the head. Be slow and careful to ensure you do not bang the head against the ground.


The arm you extended out a right angle will stop her from rolling over any further.Rolling too far can block free expansion of the chest and impede breathing.
You can also roll the person by grabbing her firmly by the hip — either by a belt or the waistband of her pants, or by a front pocket — and pulling, with one hand on the shoulder farthest from you for stabilization.

, Once you have rolled the person over, and ensured that he is secure and the head is supported, you can open the airway a little. To do this, gently tilt the head back and lift the chin. Check that the airway is clear of any blockages.


Continue to monitor his pulse and breathing while you wait for help to arrive.
Cover him with a blanket or coat to keep him warm.

Place the infant face down over your arm.,
Support the neck and head.,
Keep the mouth and nose clear.,
Wait for help.",How to Put Someone in the Recovery Position2," The recovery position for an infant, a baby under one year old, is different. You should begin by carefully laying the infant over your arm, face down, and at a slight angle. The infant’s head should be slightly lower than the body.Try to keep the elevation of the body above the head no more than five degrees. This keeps the baby from aspirating any fluids/blockages and encourages drainage.

, When you lay the infant on your arm, you should be sure to support the neck and head with your other hand. So, if you are laying the infant over your left arm, place your right hand under her head and neck to support it., When you supporting the infant’s head, it’s essential that you do not block the mouth and nose unwittingly. Note where your fingers are, and double-check that the infant can breathe., Once you have placed the infant into the recovery position, monitor her breathing and wait for medical help to arrive. If the infant stops breathing at any point you may have to perform CPR."

Look around the area to make sure it is safe for you to help.For instance, you should look for things live electrical wires, falling rocks, live power tools, or people with weapons. Also, make sure that you and the person in trouble are out of the way of oncoming traffic if you are near a roadway.;
, Talk to the person, and gently shake her. Ask for her name. See if she can talk to you. If she can focus on you, she's conscious, but that doesn't mean she's able to breathe.An unconscious person will be completely unresponsive. She will not respond to painful stimulus, such as a hard pinch to the neck., Place your ear near the person's lips and listen. Watch his chest at the same time. If you can't see his chest rising and falling, he likely isn't breathing. If he isn't breathing, you are need to begin rescue breathing and chest compressions.Don't spend too long checking. You shouldn't look for more than 10 seconds, as every moment counts.Also, if the person is gasping or hyperventilating, you may still need to provide rescue breathing, as that is not regular breathing., Grab a nearby person, and tell her to dial 911. If you are alone, make sure you call 911 before starting rescue breathing. Otherwise, no one will be on the way to help you., Not breathing is serious, but make sure the person doesn't have another injury, such as a severely bleeding wound. You may need to stem blood before you help the person breathe., Be gentle, but turn the person so he is laying face-up. If you suspect a back or neck injury, try to have someone help you turn the person.To do so, the person helping you should grab a hip and a shoulder in the direction you want to turn the patient while you guide his head.

, Place a hand across the forehead and a hand below the chin, then tilt the head back. This opens the airway to allow air to enter the lungs.If you suspect a neck, head, or spine injury, you should not perform the head tilt. If you have been trained, perform a jaw-thrust. Kneel above the person's head and place a hand on either side of her head. Place your middle and index fingers behind and under her jaw, then push up so the jaw is jutting out, as though she has an underbite.

, See if anything in his mouth is blocking the airway. Look for gum or even pills or toothpicks, as all of these things could be in someone's mouth. Remove them before moving onward.If the blockage is down the throat and not in the mouth, do not attempt to pull it out, as you may force it further in.

, Hold the person's nose. Place your mouth over the person's mouth. You need to completely cover her mouth to get a proper seal, which is also why you hold her nose.If one is readily available, you can use a breathing barrier, which is sometimes included in first aid kids. However, don't let the search for one slow you down.To use a breathing barrier, use a CE grip to get proper suction. The CE grip is done by making a C with your pointer and thumb on both hands and placing is around the round part of the mask. Use all your other fingers to hold under the chin. Make sure to sit directly above the head, facing down the body to properly execute this.
If you cannot breathe through the person's mouth, you will need to breathe through her nose. Cover her mouth with your hand, and then use your mouth to cover her nose. Proceed as normal., Take at least a second to blow into the person's mouth. Watch to see if his chest rises.If his chest doesn't rise, you may need to check again for anything blocking the airway, or you may need to tilt his head further., For rescue breathing, you generally give two breaths in a row before moving back to chest compressions in CPR. Chest compressions are only necessary in a patient without a pulse., For children and adults, you can gently shake them to check for consciousness. For infants, lightly flick the bottom of her foot to see if she responds., Though you definitely want to call for help as quickly as possible, with a child or infant, it's important to give a 2 minute round of CPR before dialing 911, as damage can set in more quickly., Instead of only giving two rescue breaths, give five breaths to both children and infants., For an adult, you need to blow fairly hard to make her chest rise. With a child or infant, you can blow more gently, as it takes less air to make her chest rise., When working on an infant, you will need to cover both the infant's mouth and nose with your mouth. A baby's mouth is too small to just cover the mouth.If a baby's chest doesn't rise, re-tilt the head back to try the open the airway. If you still don't see the chest rise, you may need to move on to the procedure for a choking baby., You'll still need to check for obstructions and lightly tilt the child's or infant's head back to open the airway. Also, you'll still need to cover the child's mouth with yours while holding her nose."

Schedule an appointment with your doctor if this is your first Epley maneuver.If you are experiencing vertigo and have recently been diagnosed with BPPV, you should to go to a doctor who will perform the Epley maneuver to reposition your inner ear crystals.,
Understand why it is important to have the maneuver done by a doctor before trying it yourself.,
Be prepared to feel vertigo in the first step of the maneuver.,
Be ready for the doctor to rotate your head again.,
Roll onto your side.,
Return to a sitting position.After 30 seconds, your doctor will quickly lift you into a sitting position.,
Allow yourself to heal after the maneuver is performed.After your appointment with the doctor, you might be given a soft neck brace that you will most likely be instructed to wear for the rest of the day.",How to Perform the Epley Maneuver1," A doctor or therapist is the only person who should do this maneuver if this is your first time experiencing BPPV. However, they will teach you how to perform it on yourself, just in case your symptoms return in the future.;
, While you can do the maneuver at home (covered in Method Two of this article), going through the process with a doctor first will help you understand what it feels like to have the procedure done correctly. Trying at home without any context can actual further displace your ear crystals and make your vertigo worse!


If you already know what this procedure feels like when done correctly, you can move to method two to refresh your memory on how to perform it.

, The doctor will seat you on the edge of a table or bed, with your head facing forward. Your doctor will then place one hand on each side of your head and will quickly move your head 45 degrees to the right. She will then immediately lie you down on the table so that your head is still in the 45 degree angle to the right. Your doctor will ask you to remain in this position for 30 seconds.Your head will be lying off the examination table or, if you have a pillow behind your back, your head will be on the table. Whatever level your head is resting at, the goal is to have your head lower than the rest of your body when you lie down.

, While you remain in the position she has just placed you in, she will reposition herself and then quickly rotate your head 90 degrees to the opposite side (which means that she will turn your head so that it is facing to the left).You should pay attention to any feelings of vertigo that you have. These will most likely stop after 30 seconds in this new position.

, Next the doctor will ask you to roll onto your left side, while she rapidly rotates your head to the right (your nose will now be angled at the floor). To visualize what you will be doing, imagine that you are lying on your right side on your bed, but your face is pointing down into your pillow. You will hold this position for 30 seconds.Double check the rotation side and nose direction. Note that if your doctor determines the problem is on the right, they will rotate your body and head to the left, and vice versa.

, You should not feel any vertigo at this time; if you do, this maneuver can be repeated until you are no longer having vertigo. Sometimes it takes more than one maneuver to get all of your inner ear crystals back into their proper places.


Note that, for BPPV on the LEFT side, the same procedure should be performed with the sides reversed.

, Your doctor will also give you instructions on how to sleep and move around so that you do not experience vertigo again. These instructions are covered in Part 3 of this article.

Look for classic signs of choking.,
Tell someone to call emergency services.,
Understand the Red Cross recommendations for a person who is choking.,
Reach around the victim from behind.,
Make a fist with your dominant hand.,
Wrap your other hand firmly around this fist.,
Pull inward and upward, pressing into the victim's abdomen with quick, forceful upward thrusts.,
Continue to perform the Heimlich maneuver.,
Call 911 before you begin.,
Find the area over the cricothyroid membrane on the victim’s neck.,
Make a half inch horizontal cut about a half inch deep.,
Maintain the opening to facilitate breathing.,
Administer two breaths through the breathing tube.",How to Perform a Tracheotomy," Someone who is choking may display the following symptoms: Difficulty breathing
Noisy breathing
Inability to talk
Inability to cough
Skin turning blue (called ""cyanosis,"" which is due to lack of oxygen circulating in the blood)
Decreasing level of consciousness;
, It is important to call emergency medical personnel via 911 or a local number immediately when a person is choking; more than three to five minutes without oxygen to the brain will likely result in death.

, These include alternating between five ""back blows"" and five ""abdominal thrusts"" (also known as the Heimlich maneuver), repeating the cycle until the object is dislodged, emergency personnel arrive, or the victim becomes unconscious due to lack of oxygen. Back blows are a forceful motion with the heel of your hand between the person's shoulder blades, when he is bending over so that his trunk is at least parallel to the ground (this way, if you successfully dislodge the obstructing object it will fall with gravity out of the victim's airway). The back blows are optional, depending on whether you have been trained how to effectively do these (if not, skip them and do only ""abdominal thrusts,"" which are described in the next section).

, Circle your hands around the victim's abdomen (stomach).


If the victim is sitting or standing, position yourself directly behind her. If the victim is lying down, lay behind her.If the victim is already unconscious, check for a pulse. If there is no pulse, proceed straight to CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) at a rate of 100 chest compressions per minute. Do not attempt abdominal thrusts at this time (and do not do rescue breaths in this situation as the airway is obstructed)., Your thumb should point into the fist. Place this fist just above the victim's navel (belly button) and under the breastbone.

, Be sure to keep your thumb away from the victim's body to prevent injury to the victim.

, Make the motion similar to the letter ""J"" – in, then up.

, Do this as long as the person maintains some breathing sounds (including gasping, choking, or any audible air motion).


If the person is unable to breathe at all, and the Heimlich maneuver is unsuccessful at dislodging the object, proceed to tracheotomy.
This is a risky procedure and should only be used as a last resort; if possible, it should be performed by a medical professional.

, Make sure that you call 911 before you begin to make sure that performing a tracheotomy is even necessary. The emergency response team may be nearby.

If you truly have no other option but to perform a tracheotomy, then you should still stay on the phone with emergency services. The dispatcher may be able to talk you through the procedure or put you in contact with someone who can. Having someone on the phone may also help to keep you calm.

, This is the soft spot on the throat where the incision will be made.


To find this, find the Adam's apple, or larynx. Both men and women have an Adam's apple, but they are more pronounced on adult men. You may have to feel the victim's neck to find the Adam's apple on a woman or a child.
Slide your finger down from the Adam's Apple until you feel another bulge; this is the cricoid cartilage.
There is a slight indentation in between the Adam's Apple and the cricoid cartilage; this is where the incision will be made., Just below your cut, you'll see the cricothyroid membrane (it is a yellowish elastic membrane located between the surrounding layers of cartilage).Make an incision on the membrane itself. The depth of the puncture should be just sufficient to gain access to the airway.


Given the emergency nature of this procedure, it is okay to proceed without formal sterilization. Time is of the essence, and the concern of potential infection can be dealt with when emergency medical personnel arrive. However, if gloves are available — even if they are not sterile — use them to protect yourself from bloodborne diseases like HIV and hepatitis.

, Do this by placing a straw tube 2 inches (5.1 cm) into the trachea.


You can suck on the straw and see if you get air coming back to you to confirm that it is correctly located in the victim's airway. A ball point pen casing (with the ink-filled tube from the inside removed) is also a good option for a tube.

, These should last approximately one second each. Hopefully the victim will begin breathing on her own (you will see her chest rise and fall if she is breathing on her own). If the victim is breathing on her own, continue to supervise her and wait for emergency medical personnel to arrive to deal with the situation more definitively.
If the victim is not breathing on her own, continue giving breaths and check for a pulse. In the absence of a pulse, proceed to CPR.
The cycle for CPR is 30 chest compressions (at a rate of approximately 100 chest compressions per minute) followed by two rescue breaths through the breathing tube. Repeat this cycle approximately five times.
If the victim is unresponsive after five cycles, use an AED (automated external defibrillator) if you have been trained how to do so. If not, follow instructions from emergency medical personnel who can give directions over the phone while you await their arrival. Note that if you are untrained in CPR, the chest compressions are more important than the rescue breaths, so it is okay to do chest compressions only (at a rate of 100/minute) and to omit the breaths until emergency medical personnel arrive. Remember that doing something is better than nothing, as someone's life is on the line here!

"
"
First off, and most importantly, stay calm.,
The first thing to do is call 9-1-1 or get someone else to.,
Do not move the victim.,
Unless the situation is very dire, wait for the emergency services to arrive.,
If lives are in danger (such as the occurrence of fire/explosion) you can act, especially if it will be some time before the paramedics arrive on the scene.

,
If necessary, get the individual(s) out of the plane/train/car/etc.,
By that point, the paramedics should be on scene.",How to React when You Witness a Crash," Rushing head first into a dangerous situation without a plan never did anyone much good. As quickly as possible, focus on how severe the crash is, and what must be done to remedy the situation. It could be a minor accident with no one very badly injured, or a terrible crash with lives at stake.;
, Even if it's a minor crash, something has to be done about it.

, Head, neck and back injuries are common with crashes. Stabilize the head and neck by placing one hand on each side of the head. This will keep it from moving and prevent any further injury.

, It's in their training, and they know what to do.

,, Be careful with them. They could have severe bodily damage, in which case you should only move them if it is VERY important you do so.

, If you are out in the country, it will take a lot longer. In which case, it is temporarily up to you to care for the injured.

"
"
Know when to perform the maneuver at home.,
Put your pillow in the right position.,
Lie down in a swift motion.,
Move your head 90 degrees to the left.While you are lying down, quickly turn your head 90 degrees to the opposite side (in this case the left).,
Shift your whole body (including your head) to the left.,
Hold the last position and then sit up.,
Opt to perform the maneuver just before bed.Especially if it is your first time performing the Epley maneuver on yourself, it is ideal to do it right before bed.",How to Perform the Epley Maneuver2," You should only perform the maneuver at home if your doctor has clearly diagnosed you with BPPV. If there is a chance that your vertigo is caused by some other condition, the maneuver should only be done by a doctor. The maneuver you will do at home is almost the same as the one the doctor performed, only there will be some slight adjustments.You should not do the Epley maneuver at home if you have had a recent neck injury, if you have a history of stroke, or if you have a limited range of your neck motion.

, Place a pillow on your bed so that when you lie down, it will be behind your back and your head will be lower than the rest of your body. Sit on the bed and turn your head 45 degrees to the right.


If possible ask someone to be there while you do this maneuver. It will be very helpful to have someone keep time for you, as you will have to remain in each position for 30 seconds.

, With your head still rotated 45 degrees to the left, quickly lie back so that the pillow is under your shoulders and your head is lower than your shoulders. Your head should be resting on the bed. Keep your head at the 45 degree angle facing the right. Wait for 30 seconds., Do not lift your head when you turn it; if you do, you may have to start the maneuver over. Stay in this position for 30 seconds again.

, From your position where you are facing the left, move your body so you that you are lying on your right side. Your head should be facing down so that your nose is touching the bed. Keep in mind that you head will be turned more than your body., Wait 30 seconds in the last position, lying on your right side with your head facing down so your nose touches the bed. Once the 30 seconds is up, sit up. You can repeat the self-maneuver 3 to 4 times a day until you do not feel any sensations of vertigo. Note that, if you have BPPV on the left side, do the same exercise but with the sides reversed., This way, if something goes wrong and you inadvertently trigger more dizziness or vertigo, you can sleep it off (as opposed to having it negatively impact your day).

Once you have practiced the maneuver and feel comfortable performing it on yourself, feel free to do it at any time during the day.

"
"
Wait for 10 minutes before leaving the doctor's office.It is important to wait so that the debris in your inner ear can settle before you inadvertently shake it up again.,
Wear a soft collar for the rest of the day.,
Sleep with your head and shoulders in a mostly upright position.The night after you have the maneuver done, you should plan on sleeping with your head kept up at a 45 degree angle.,
Keep your head as vertical as possible during the day.,
Test the results.After you have waited for a full week avoiding symptoms that are known to provoke your BPPV, try an experiment and see if you can cause yourself to experience vertigo again (by assuming one of the positions that may previously have triggered it).",How to Perform the Epley Maneuver3," This helps to avoid any rebound symptoms of vertigo right after leaving the doctor's office (or right after performing the maneuver on yourself).

After about 10 minutes, the debris should be settled and you are safe to proceed with your day as normal.

, After you get the maneuver performed on you by a doctor, you will be given a soft collar (also known as a soft neck brace) that you will be asked to wear for the rest of the day. The collar will help to control your head movements so that you don’t accidentally move your head in a way that makes your inner ear crystals get out of place again., You can do this by propping yourself up with pillows or by sleeping in a reclining chair., This means keeping your neck as straight as possible, with your head facing forward. Avoid doing things like going to the dentist or hairdresser, where they tilt your head backwards. You should also avoid exercises where your head moves around a lot. You should not tilt your head back more than 30 degrees.When you shower, position yourself so that you are directly under the shower head so that you don’t have to tilt your head back.
If you are a man who needs to shave, bend your body forward rather than tilting your head to shave.
Avoid any other positions that are known to trigger your BPPV for at least one week after the Epley maneuver has been performed., If the maneuver was successful, you should not be able to trigger the vertigo in yourself at this time. It may return again down the road, but the Epley maneuver is highly successful and serves as a temporary cure for BPPV in about 90% of people."

Stop drinking early.,
Enjoy alcohol-free days.,
Find out the risks and dangers of drinking.",How to Recognize and Treat Alcohol Poisoning," Alcohol poisoning can happen as a result of binge drinking, which is consuming at least four drinks for women and five for men within two hours.However, certain factors can increase your risk for developing the condition. These include:Your size, weight, and overall health
If you’ve had anything to eat recently
Drug use
Alcohol percentage in your beverages
Frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption
Your tolerance level, which can drop dangerously if the temperature is high, you are dehydrated or have been exerting yourself physically;
, Pay attention to how much you or a friend is drinking as much as possible. This may help you more easily identify the signs and symptoms of alcohol poisoning, inform medical personnel, or even minimize the risk of getting the condition. One drink equals:


12 ounces (355 ml) of regular beer containing about 5% alcohol
8-9 ounces (237-266 ml) of malt liquor containing about 7% alcohol
5 ounces (148 ml) of wine containing about 12% alcohol
1.5 ounces (44ml) of 80-proof hard liquor containing about 40% alcohol.Examples of hard liquor include gin, rum, tequila, whiskey, and vodka., Alcohol poisoning often presents with specific physical symptoms for which you should watch. You don’t have to have all of the symptoms to have alcohol poisoning, but you should look out for:Vomiting
Seizures
Slow breathing, which is defined as less than eight breaths per minute
Irregular breathing, which is defined as more than 10 seconds per breath
Skin that is pale or blue-tinged
Hypothermia, or low body temperature
Passing out

, In addition to the physical symptoms of alcohol poisoning, there are also some cognitive signs of the condition. You or a friend should look out for:Mental confusion
Stupor
Coma or unconsciousness
Inability to wake up
Loss of orientation/balance

, Alcohol poisoning is an emergency and can lead to serious consequences including death. If you suspect that someone has consumed too much alcohol, cut them off and get medical care immediately.Not getting help in time can lead to the following medical consequences:Choking on vomit
Slowed or stopped breathing
Cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat
Stopped heartbeat
Hypothermia, or low body temperature
Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, which can cause seizures
Severe dehydration from vomiting that can lead to seizures, permanent brain damage, and death.
Acute pancreatitis
Death

, Contact emergency medical services or take the person to a local hospital if you suspect alcohol poisoning, even if the person isn’t exhibiting signs or symptoms of the condition.This can ensure that the person doesn’t develop any other serious conditions or die, and get the necessary treatment to overcome alcohol poisoning.


Avoid driving if you’ve consumed alcohol. Instead, call 911 or a taxi to take you to a hospital.
Provide emergency medical services or doctors any information that may help them treat you or the person. This includes the kind of and amount of alcohol consumed, as well as when it was consumed.If you are worried about getting medical help for someone because you are drinking while underage, put those concerns aside and call for help. While you might be afraid of getting in trouble with the police or your parents if you are not old enough to drink, not getting help can have much more serious consequences, including death., While you’re waiting for emergency personnel or to arrive at a hospital, monitor the person you suspect has alcohol poisoning. Watching symptoms and bodily functions can help you stave off more serious consequences or death as well as allow you to provide information to medical personnel., If you are with someone who is unconscious as a result of alcohol, stay with her. This can ensure that she doesn’t vomit and choke or stop breathing.Avoid forcing the person to vomit, which could cause her to choke.Roll the person on her side, into the recovery position, if she’s passed out, which can minimize the risk of choking on vomit., If the person you suspect has alcohol poisoning is vomiting, try and keep him sitting upright. This can minimize the risk for choking or even death.Place the person on his side in the recover position if he needs to lie down so that he doesn't choke.Try and keep him awake to minimize the risk of losing consciousness.Give him water if he can drink it to minimize the risk of dehydration., Cover the person with a blanket, coat, or some other item to keep her warm. This will lower her risk of going into shock and make her more comfortable., There are some things that you may think can help a person with alcohol poisoning sober up, but they can actually be quite harmful. The following will not reverse symptoms and may make his situation worse:Drinking coffee
Cold showers
Walking
Drinking more alcohol

, Once the person is admitted into the hospital, she will undergo evaluation and treatment for alcohol poisoning.Doctors will manage any symptoms and continue to monitor the patient.Treatment for alcohol poisoning may include:Inserting a tube into the mouth and windpipe, which is called intubation, to open the airway, aid breathing, and remove any blockages.
Inserting an IV into the vein to regulate hydration, blood sugar, and vitamin levels.
Inserting a catheter into the bladder.
Pumping the stomach, which consists of inserting a tube into the nose or mouth and flushing fluids into the body.
Receiving oxygen therapy.
Undergoing hemodialysis, which filters waste and toxins from your body.

, If you drink alcohol, over time you will become increasingly tolerant to the drug and may even become dependent. However, by being smart about your drinking and doing so in moderation, you can enjoy alcohol without developing a dependence.Alcohol tolerance is when your body adapts to drinking a specific amount of alcohol, including one beer or one glass of wine.Dependence is the consistent and compulsive consumption of alcohol and needing to drink to function., Figure out what your current tolerance level is. This may help you avoid drinking too much and developing alcohol poisoning.


Gauge your tolerance based on how much you currently drink. For example, if you don’t drink or only have a couple of drinks a week, your tolerance may be comparatively low. If you drink more, your tolerance may be accordingly higher.

, Drink alcoholic beverages by following sensible consumption guidelines. This can help you minimize the risk of becoming dependent or getting alcohol poisoning.Women should have no more than 2-3 units of alcohol daily.Men should have no more than 3-4 units of alcohol daily.Alcohol units are based on the percentage alcohol in a beverage and the amount of alcohol consumed.For reference, a bottle of wine has 9-10 units.Go slowly if you’re enjoying an extra drink or two within the guidelines. For example, consume only one additional drink than you normally would. If you never drink, have one, or even a half of, an alcoholic beverage. For one glass of wine or one spirit, have one and a half or two drinks.
Drink water while you drink alcohol, as it mitigates the reflexive ""drink while others drink"" influence and hydrates as you go.

, Be aware of how much alcohol you’ve consumed and stop early if you are unsure of the amount you had. This can help prevent you getting drunk or alcohol poisoning, or possibly worse. You may want to set a time at which you will stop drinking in the evening. For instance, you may decide that you won't drink alcohol past midnight when you go out.

, Consider having at least two alcohol-free days every week. This can minimize your risk of becoming dependent and help your body recover from previous drinking.Be aware that not being able to go a day without alcohol is a sign that you are dependent.Seek professional help if you find that you need alcohol.

, Whenever you drink alcohol, you risk of harming your body. The only form of risk-free alcohol consumption is not drinking at all. The more you drink, the greater your risk of potential damage to your body.Alcohol tolerance cannot protect you from the dangers of drinking.Alcohol can cause weight gain, depression, skin problems, and memory loss in the short term.In the long term, you can develop high blood pressure, chronic liver disease, and breast cancer from alcohol consumption."

Find a bag.,
Pack as much as you think necessary, with at the very least one outfit per person, water purification tablets, the first aid kit, and food.,
Use your bag's main compartment for the bulky big things such as food, blankets, clothes, etc.,
Wrap plastic bags around the inside of each pocket.,
Make a first aid kit.,
Include food.,
Buy and pack an emergency stove, which is easy to operate.,
Include water and/or a water-purifying system.,
Add a blanket or solar blanket.,
Include a few large bags for shelter and protection purposes.

,
Include any other items you think you might need.,
Buy and include a multiple tool and a multiple utensil tool.,
Keep the bag at a place where it is easy to find.,
Recheck the contents.",How to Pack an Emergency Bag," It can be anything from a backpack to a laundry bag, as long as is easy to carry and comfortable, though a large backpack with several pockets is ideal. Also, make sure it is made of a more lightweight material so that it reduces the weight you will be carrying around with you.;
, However, do not carry too much because it will increase the weight you will be carrying.

, If you are left with extra space, add a bunch of small items on top of it as well.

, This will help protect the items inside. Also, it will prevent ruining your bag in case you are carrying any liquids and they happen to leak.

, A burn proof, melt proof, waterproof, airtight tub is ideal, but another container can be used (like a pencil case) to store smaller items. Include:


At least 25 plasters/band-aids, of different sizes, shapes and qualities.
At least 25 bandages, of different sizes and shapes.
4-5 inhalers if anyone is asthmatic, or 1 inhaler if no one is.
3 clean, sterilized needles and a few rolls of clean black thread. If someone needs stitches, these will be useful.
Several boxes of painkillers, such as paracetamol, and several boxes of pain killing anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen.
A tub of lip balm. If someone has chapped lips, or even needs the outside of a wound numbing, this is useful.
Several travel sized hand sanitizes
Q-tips, cotton balls, tissues, fishing kits, fire kits, candles, a pack of tissues, a fishing kit, fire kit, candles, LED flashlights or headlamps can also fit there.

, You can get MRE (meals ready to eat) from the military, as well as nonperishable food right out of your pantry (granola bars, canned goods, etc.) Make sure you go to the store see what you can find to maintain a nutritious diet.

, The ideal emergency stove requires no liquid, priming, wicks, or pressure.

, Water helps you cook some foods, keeps you alive, and cleans cuts and wounds. Clean water is a major must have!


You're unlikely to be able to carry enough water with you for a real, ongoing emergency situation, but some water purification tablets or a water filter can be a good longer-term solution.

, You may need something to keep you warm or to build a shelter.

,, Consider hiking boots, sunglasses, a hammock, a tent, clothes, personal belongings, utensils, cups, first aid, light sources, etc.

, They are so helpful in a situation with making a shelter.

, At the time of emergency, you will not have much time to spare to search for the bag., Make sure you are not missing any items and have packed everything you need. Also check if everything you are carrying is of use to you and you are not unnecessarily wasting space in your bag. Try to make your bag as light as possible and cut down as much as you can. Nobody wants to be carrying a heavy bag around."

Examine the splinter.,
Use tape to gently pull the splinter out.,
Try using glue to get the splinter out.,
Apply baking soda to get the splinter out.,
Use ichthammol ointment to remove the splinter.,
Apply epsom salts to the splinter.",How to Painlessly Remove a Splinter1," Use a magnifying glass to examine the splinter. Check how deep it is under your skin. Run the splinter under warm water in the faucet and pat it dry with a clean cloth., This works best for a splinter that is sticking out of your skin. Tear off a small piece of scotch tape or duct tape and place it on the affected area. Pull the tape off in the opposite direction of the splinter. If the splinter appears to be tilted to the right, for example, you would pull the tape off towards the left.
Make sure the area around the splinter is dry and that the tape is clean. Tape that is old and covered with debris could cause an infection.

, Apply craft glue on the splinter and the skin surrounding the splinter. Let the glue dry and harden. Once the glue is dry, peel it slowly off the skin. The splinter should stick to the glue and come out without any painful digging.

Make sure you use a very mild, non-toxic glue, like one used in classrooms, rather than super glue or wood glue. These glues can cause even more damage to your skin when you try to pull the splinter out.

, Mix baking soda with water to make a paste. Start with about 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 1/4 cup of water, or enough water to form a paste. Apply the paste to the affected area of the splinter and cover it with a band-aid. Let the band-aid and tape sit for about 24 hours. Peel off the band-aid and look for the splinter, removing it with a pair of tweezers.


The baking soda paste can make it easier for you to spot the splinter. It can also make the splinter easier to remove.

, Ichthammol ointment can be found at your local drugstore or pharmacy. It works much like the baking soda. Apply the ointment to affected area of the splinter. Let it sit for around 24 hours, covering it with a band-aid. Remove the band-aid. The splinter should then naturally come out.


When you use the ichthammol ointment, you will not need to pull the splinter out with tweezers. The ointment should encourage the splinter to come to the surface on its own.
You can also use hydrogen peroxide instead of the ichthammol ointment.

, Put epsom salt on the bandage section of a band-aid and wrap it over the splinter. The salt should slowly encourage the splinter to come out of your skin. Repeat this process every day until the splinter falls out."
"
Try a warm milk and bread mixture.,
Soak the area in white vinegar.,
Remove the splinter with a banana peel.,
Use an egg to help get rid of the splinter.,
Apply potato slices.",How to Painlessly Remove a Splinter2," You can try to remove the splinter using natural products found in your kitchen, such as warm milk and bread.Start by placing the milk in a small kettle and put it on the stove. Heat the milk until it is warm but still cool enough to be applied to the skin. Pour the milk into a heat-proof bowl.
Place a few pieces of bread in the bowl and let them sit for a few minutes, soaking up the milk. Apply the moistened bread pieces to the splinter area and put it under a band-aid or piece of gauze.
Leave the pieces on your skin for as long as possible and then remove them. Hopefully the splinter is drawn out by the warm milk and bread mixture.

, Vinegar is acidic and can shrink the skin around the splinter. This may help the splinter to come to the surface. You can use white vinegar or apple cider vinegar for this method.Pour a half cup of vinegar in a bowl and soak the area with the splinter in the vinegar. Check to see if the splinter emerges after 10 to 15 minutes. The vinegar will need a little while to work, sometimes as long as 30 minutes. If this method does not work the first time, soak the area in some warm water and then try again.
Keep in mind vinegar can sting if there are any open wounds around the splinter. Be careful when using vinegar around any cuts or wounds on your skin.

, This method uses the inside of a banana peel. The moisture in the peel will help to work the splinter up and out.Cut out a small square from a banana peel. Place the banana peel on the affected area and cover it with a band-aid.
Let the banana peel sit on the affected area overnight. The peel should cause the splinter to rise to the surface of your skin. In many cases the splinter will stick to the actual peel itself.

, You can use an egg to help get rid of a splinter, using the paper-like membrane in the shell of the egg.Start by cracking open an egg. Then, remove the yolk. Inside the shell, you should notice a paper-like membrane.
Place a piece of the inside of the shell on your splinter and then secure it with a band aid. Leave the band aid on overnight. The membrane in the shell will go inside your splinter and encourage it to emerge from your skin. In the morning, you can remove the band aid. The splinter should come up and out on its own.

, This method uses the moisture of the inside of a white potato to encourage the splinter to come out on its own. Make sure the potato is fresh and free of mold, as you will be applying it directly to your skin.Cut the potato into small pieces or slices. Apply the slices to the area with the splinter using gauze or a band-aid to keep the slices in place.
Let the potato piece sit for an hour at first, checking it regularly. For deeper and larger splinters it may take as long as overnight to fully remove the splinter. In the morning, remove the potato, and the splinter should come out easily.

To change out the dressing once or twice a day, you’ll go through a lot of gauze and saline, so prepare accordingly and you won't have to make multiple runs to the store. You will need the following items:


Sterile wetting solution. You may need a prescription to get saline at the drugstore, or you can make your own by boiling 1 tsp. of salt in at least a quart of water for five minutes.
For packing the wound, you'll need sterile gloves, clean towels, a clean bowl, and scissors or tweezers that have been sterilized in boiling water.
For dressing the wound, you’ll need packing gauze, bandages for the outer dressing, medical tape, and cotton swabs or Q-tips.;
, Wounds need to be packed in a clean, sterile environment. If you’re working at home, dusty kitchen tables and TV trays are covered with germs that could cause infection. But you've got to work somewhere, so wherever you plan on doing the dressing, you need to wash and disinfect the surface thoroughly with disinfectant cleaner before you attempt to pack your wound.Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water to get started. Scrub up to the elbow on both hands, and keep your fingernails neat and trimmed.

, After cleaning your work surface and getting ready to pack the wound, put a clean towel over the area. Pour enough salt water or saline solution into a clean bowl. You won't need a lot, just enough to gently moisten the packing material. Open the outer dressing material–bandage and tape–as well and place it on the towel. Keep it away from the bowl, and don’t get it wet.


Cut off a length of packing material and carefully wet it with the saline. Never soak packing materials in the packing solution, just dampen it slightly. If saline is dripping from the packing material, it’s too wet.
Many nurses and home dressers find it effective to cut pieces of tape to the desired length, then hang them on the edge of the table for later, so you won't have to work with digging at the tape roll when you want to be finishing the wound dressing. Organize your space however works best for you.

, You can never be too careful with the hand washing, especially if you're dealing with a deep and significant open wound. Infection can be deadly. Keep your hands clean using soap and water, then put on latex medical gloves for added protection.

, Squeeze the packing material to wring out any excess saline solution in the sterilized gauze. The packing should be moist, but not dripping. Use enough of the packing to fill the wound space completely, but not tightly. Gently work the material into the wound, using a cotton swab or a Q-tips to guide it in.


Although the packing should fill the wound, it should not be forced tightly into the wound. Any gauze ends that do not fit into the wound should be neatly placed on top of the wound, then wrapped in the outer dressing to secure everything safely.
Be gentle and swift. There's no big secret to getting the gauze into the wound–you just have to work it in there as gently as possible. Depending on the size and shape of the wound, it may be very easy or it may take some negotiating. Watch the patient closely and communicate to make sure you're not packing it too tightly, causing discomfort.

, Outer dressings should be made up of squares of gauze sponge, to cover the packing, the wound, and seal everything up tightly and comfortably, protecting the packing from the outside. Layer sterile 4 x 4 gauze sponges over the wound, using enough to cover the entire site, with some extra around the outside for security.


Tape the outer dressing in place, at least an inch or two beyond the diameter of the wound’s edge, using the medical tape you hung off the corner of the table earlier. Always pick up the gauze by the edges, being careful not to over-handle it and risk infection.

, Start by removing the tape of the outer dressing and gently pulling back the gauze sponge of the outer dressing. Use one hand–clean and gloved–to hold the skin around the wound steady, and use the other hand to pull the outer dressing free.


Be especially careful to look for any crusty blood or other seepage that may have formed, and stuck to the dressing. Use a Q-Tip moistened with saline to gently work the bandage off, if necessary. Go slowly and be extremely gentle.
Put all discarded dressing materials into a plastic bag and dispense of them immediately, keeping them away from children and pets.

, Use your sterilized tweezers or your fingers to pinch the corner of the packing and start gently pulling it free of the wound. Go extremely slowly and use caution. Stay focused on getting the packing free, keeping aware of any crust that has formed between the wound and the gauze. Use your Q-Tip to work it loose if necessary. Pull the entire packing free and inspect the wound to make sure that no gauze is left in the wound., Depending on the severity and the depth of your wound, removing the packing may result in some bleeding, especially the first time you replace the packing. If this occurs, use a gauze sponge to apply direct pressure, pressing firmly and uniformly for at least five minutes to give time for a clot to form and stop the bleeding. Move forward with the packing.


If you cannot get the bleeding to stop, or the wound is still bleeding a day or two after getting your wound checked out by a doctor, you need to return to the hospital immediately and get your wound checked out.

, After you've removed the packing, you need to inspect the wound very closely for any signs of infection. Discoloration, excess seepage, or unpleasant odors are all signs of infection that should be addressed immediately by returning to the hospital and getting the necessary treatment. A doctor may need to administer antibiotics or alternative methods of dressing the wound.


For more specific instructions regarding the care of open wounds, read the next section.

, Use soap and water to wash the area around the wound very gently with soap and water. Use a clean sponge, warm water, and antibacterial soap to clean the skin around the wound. Don't soak the wound and don't soap directly in deep wounds. Wash around the perimeter.

, After removing the packing and cleaning the area, repack the wound immediately, as outlined in the first section, unless directed otherwise. Always following the instructions of your doctor and change the dressing according to the recovery plan for your wound. Some wounds will need to be packed a few times a day, while others will have different methods of recovery.

, Always follow your doctor’s instructions regarding the changing of an open wound. After the tissue begins to heal, most doctors will allow the wound to be changed out once a day, eventually dropping the packing entirely to allow the wound to begin healing more thoroughly. When enough tissue is built up, the external dressing should be enough to allow the wound to continue healing properly.Most wounds should never need to be packed for more than 10 days. Always pay attention to symptoms and common sense–if it seems to be healing improperly, call your doctor. If it seems to be taking too long, call your doctor.

, While you're changing out the wound, it's very important to keep a close watch for any of the following signs of infection. Call your doctor immediately if the patient experiences:


Temperature over 101.5 °F (38.6 °C)
Chills
Wound tissue that changes from pink to white, yellow, or black in color
Foul-smelling drainage or fluid from the wound
Increased redness or swelling of the wound or skin around it
Increasing tenderness or pain in or around the wound.

, While you're packing and caring for an open wound, it's critical to avoid soaking the wound or getting the area extremely wet. This can promote infection and keep the wound from healing properly. Let your body do the work of healing itself and avoid getting the wound wet.


You may shower, keeping the wound free of water, after the first 24 hours. Usually, you can wrap the area in plastic, or simply keep your arm outside the spray of the water to keep it safe. Your doctor may have more specific instructions regarding cleaning the wound.

, Caring for an open wound is serious business. If you have any hesitations or concerns about the healing process, you should call your doctor immediately. Don't wait and allow infection to become more severe. Blood infections and gangrene can result from wounds looked after improperly.

, Put something on your hand to remind yourself — a stamp, a bracelet, a weird ring. Paint the nails on the hand you would use to pick the scab. Hopefully you will remember when you see your nails that you shouldn’t be near the scab. Even better, paint your nails black or green — something that really stands out — and don’t paint the fingernails on your other hand., Make a deal with yourself — if I go a day without picking my scab, I get X. Or if that’s too much time, make a deal where you reward yourself after half a day.

, People who suffer from it compulsively pick at their skin and can’t help themselves. If you think it might apply to you, please consult a medical professional., It’s important to properly bandage it so that you can’t get at it to pick at it. Cuts and scrapes are common, and most of these will create a scab during the healing process. Try using glycerin soap rather than an antibacterial soap on your wound. Glycerin soap is better for hydrating and moisturizing your skin. Be gentle when washing the scab -- you don’t want to tear it. Pat the scab dry., Choose an antibiotic cream or ointment, available at any pharmacy. Keeping the scab covered in cream or ointment will speed up the healing and kill any germs that might remain in the wound. It might sting, but it’s going to help the wound heal better than it would without antibiotics., Even though many of us have learned that you shouldn’t cover a wound, new research shows that it’s actually better to cover it. It will probably take at least four to five days for the scab to fully form and the wound to heal. Keep it covered for that period., When you scrape or break your skin, special blood cells called platelets begin to stick together and form a clot where you hurt yourself. These clots function like a protective bandage that keep the wound from continuing to bleed and to shield your body from the outside germs. Scabs serve an important purpose, and you need to let your body heal itself by forming a scab., You will need to change the bandage any time it gets wet (which might be more than once a day). If it doesn’t get wet, choose a time daily to switch the bandage. Wash the scab gently and reapply the dressing., Is the scab changing color, getting puffy or oozing at all? Is the skin around the scab tender, red, or warm to the touch? These are signs of an infection that needs to be dealt with by a medical professional., Eventually, a scab falls off and reveals new skin underneath. Hopefully it will fall off by itself without you picking at it. This usually happens by itself after a week or two. If you are still having trouble getting your wound to heal, it is a good idea to check with your medical professional."

Find the patient's pulse with your fingers.,
Count the number of beats that occur in 15 seconds.,
Write down the heart rate, any irregularities and the time the pulse was taken.

",How to Measure and Record Vital Signs During First Aid2," Don't use your thumb when finding a pulse, because you will feel your own pulse instead of the patient's pulse.


Press your fingers against the bony part of patient's wrist. You will be pressing an artery between your fingers and the wrist bone, which helps you feel the pulse. Take care not to press too hard.
If you can't find the pulse in the wrist, try finding it on the side of the patient's neck or on the inside of the upper arm or upper leg.

, Multiply by 4 to get the heart rate. If the pulse is irregular, count for a full minute.


A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. In addition to the heart rate, note any irregularities.
A regularly irregular heart is one that seems to have an extra beat or a skipped beat at regular intervals.
An irregularly irregular heart rate has no real pattern of irregularity. It may be difficult to determine a heart rate.
Athletes may have heart rates lower than 60 and a person in pain or other distress may have heart rates higher than 100

",How to Measure and Record Vital Signs During First Aid4,", It should be snub but not tight, and high enough so the cuff doesn't sit in the crook of the elbow. Make sure you can see the gauge.


Use the right size cuff for the patient. Children and obese adults require different sizes of cuffs.

, You may have to hunt around between the cuff and the elbow, or even place the diaphragm of the stethoscope slightly under the cuff.


You may need to inflate the cuff slightly to put enough pressure on the artery to detect the pulse.

, Listen for the pulse to disappear.

,, Listen for the pulse to return.

, This is the systolic pressure, which is the pressure exerted on the arteries when the heart is pumping the blood.

,, This is the diastolic pressure, which is the pressure on the arteries between heartbeats.

, First list systolic pressure, then forward slash, then diastolic pressure. An example of a blood pressure reading is 120/70, which you would read as ""120 over 70.""

, For subsequent blood pressure readings, use the arm that gives the highest reading.


Normal blood pressure for adults is a systolic reading of less than 140 mmHg and a diastolic reading of less than 90 mmHg. However, patients in distress may have higher pressures, and patients who are going into shock may have diastolic readings of less than 80 mmHg. Normal blood pressure readings for children vary by age.
Be aware that you may experience an auscultatory gap, when the pulse temporarily disappears, between the systolic and diastolic readings. If the reading you get isn't what you expect, try again.

With your middle and index fingers, feel around on the patient's wrist. The pulse is usually strongest on the thumb side. When you feel a strong, steady pulse, hold your fingers there.Be sure to never use your thumb to take the pulse. Your thumb has its own pulse and it could confuse you when you're taking a reading.
If you have trouble finding the pulse on the patient's wrist, try the base of the neck just below the jawline.Make sure you check on the side of the neck closest to you.
If you are trying to locate the pulse of a child, try under the armpit. With your fingers in the armpit, feel for the arm bone. When you find the arm bone, you should also feel the pulse.You may also be able to feel the pulse on the top of his foot.
If you are checking the pulse of an infant, try the crease of the elbow. If the infant is on his back, or if you can turn him onto his back without harming him, lay one of his arms at his side with the inner-arm facing up. Use your fingers to locate the brachial pulse in the crease of his elbow.This also works on children.;
, When you've located the pulse, then count every beat you feel. Using either a watch or a timer on your phone, do this for 1 minute.If you have trouble keeping count for a minute, you could alternatively count the pulse for 15 seconds and multiply the number of beats by four.
If someone else is nearby, it helps to have one person measure the pulse and one keep time. That way you won't lose count trying to do both at once.

, Once you've recorded the heart rate, you have to assess the results to see if there are any problems. A normal pulse rate for a healthy adult is usually in the range of 60 to 100 beats per minute. If the person is exhibiting symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, headaches, and shortness of breath and his pulse falls outside of this range, seek medical attention.Pulses can vary based on age, sex, and level of physical activity. In fact, many athletic people will have a heart rate lower than 60, as their hearts are in good condition and don't need to work as hard to pump blood throughout the body. Children's pulses usually range between 80 to 160. An infant's pulse may be up to 120., Basic first aid covers a multitude of possible conditions. Some situations don't require medical attention or taking vital signs. Others require immediate medical attention. The American College of Emergency Physicians advises that any one of the following conditions can characterize a medical emergency, and you should get medical help.Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Chest or upper abdominal pain or pressure lasting two minutes or more
Fainting, sudden dizziness, or weakness
Skin that suddenly turns pale or grey, or lips that are blue
Changes in vision
Difficulty speaking
Confusion or changes in mental status, unusual behavior, difficulty walking
Any sudden or severe pain
Uncontrolled bleeding
Severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea
Coughing or vomiting blood
Unusual abdominal pain

, If you've assessed the situation and determine that there is a medical emergency present, you should seek medical attention before doing anything else.If you are unable to make the call yourself, be sure to tell one specific person to do so.
If you're unsure of the patient's exact condition, contact an emergency response team an get to the hospital in an ambulance.
First state your location, then your situation. The responders need to know where you are before all else.
If you know you can get to the hospital quickly, know the way by heart, and are certain the patient's condition won't get worse on the way, you can try to drive to the emergency room. If you have already alerted emergency services and you choose to move the person, remember to update the first responders of your decision to do so and your position as you approach the hospital.
Never attempt to move a patient if she has a spinal or neck injury. Always call an ambulance if you suspect this type of injury., Before taking the pulse, check to see if the patient is breathing. If she is breathing, you can move on to taking the pulse.Extend the patients neck so that her chin is pointing up.
Listen at her mouth for breathing.
Watch her chest for proper rise and fall of the lungs.
If the patient has stopped breathing, you may need to perform CPR. The procedure is different for adults and children, so you should know how to do both. Taking a class is a great way to learn to do CPR.
Check out the wikiHow articles on How to Do CPR on an Adult and How to Do CPR on a Child to prepare.

, After you've contacted emergency medical personnel and ensured that the patient is breathing, then you can begin checking the patient's vital signs.


If possible, have the patient sit up. If he is unconscious or you suspect a neck or spinal injury, do not attempt to move the patient. Take the pulse as best you can in the position the patient is in.
Remember to record the beats per minute and what time it was to tell the EMTs when they arrive. This will ensure that they know what they're dealing with and can provide the best care possible.
Also record the strength of the pulse. If you can barely detect the pulse, it would be categorized as weak. If the pulse is very powerful, the heart is beating too forcefully. Let the medical staff know if the pulse seems abnormally weak or strong., Even if the injury seems relatively minor, a patient's condition can change very quickly. Keep monitoring the pulse until help arrives, writing down the beats per minute and what time it was when you took the measurement. If there are any dramatic changes, it could indicate that the original injury was worse than you thought.

The snapping feeling can be caused by the actual breaking of the bone or pieces of the bone popping out of their original place. If you feel this occur, it is a good idea to stop what you’re doing and examine your hand.The popping sensation isn’t always present when a knuckle is broken. Whether or not you’ll experience a popping feeling depends on the severity of your fracture.;
, A broken knuckle is often referred to as a “boxer’s fracture” because it occurs most often when a person punches a hard surface. When your injury happened, were you punching a wall or some other immovable surface? Maybe you were involved in a fist fight. If you have been hitting something solid, there’s a good chance you may have broken your knuckle.There are other possible ways to break your knuckle that are not as common. You can break your knuckle while falling down, working with machines or doing any activity that exposes your hand to trauma.
Some doctors now call a broken knuckle a “brawler’s fracture” instead of a “boxer’s fracture” because boxers prevent broken knuckles by wearing protective gear. You’re more likely to break a knuckle hitting something with your bare fist.

, A broken knuckle will be accompanied with severe, immediate pain. Right when the injury occurs, you will experience a sharp pang in your hand which will be followed by an intense throbbing feeling. Depending on your body’s tolerance for pain, the feeling can be debilitating and force you to stop whatever you’re doing.If your knuckle only has a minor fracture, the pain may not be as severe. However, you should still stop using your hand as you could further injure your knuckle.

, The moment you break your knuckle, the blood will start flowing towards the area of the fracture causing your hand to get hot. Check the temperature in your injured hand and then your other hand. If your injured hand feels much warmer than the other one, your knuckle could be broken., If your knuckle is broken, it should start to swell after about ten minutes. The swelling will be centered around your broken knuckle and may spread out to the rest of your hand. The swelling from a broken knuckle may be severe. You may find it difficult to move your hand if it gets swollen enough.When your knuckle starts to swell, you may experience a tingling or numb sensation as well.
Take aspirin, ibuprofen or another over-the-counter pain medication to decrease the swelling and deal with the pain.
Doctors may not be able to work on your hand if it has swollen too large. Applying ice to the injury early can help alleviate swelling. Wrap an ice pack with a paper towel and apply it to your knuckle or use a bag of frozen vegetables. Keep the ice pack on for up to 20 minutes at a time and then give your skin a chance to return to normal temperature before applying the ice pack again., A bruise from a broken knuckle will appear much faster than a normal bruise. As blood rushes into your injury, the area will begin to discolor within a matter of minutes. Bruising will also make your injury very tender. It will likely hurt to even touch a broken knuckle.


There are cases of bones breaking without any bruising present, but they are rare.
Keep your hand elevated to decrease bruising. Keeping your hand above your heart will allow the blood to flow away from the injury., A surefire way to tell if you have a broken knuckle is to see if it has sunk beneath your other knuckles. If you can, curl your injured hand into a fist and look at your knuckles. They should stick out. If there is one knuckle that you can’t see, then that knuckle is definitely broken.The fracture may affect the position or angulation of your knuckle, causing it to sink.

, If your bone is sticking through your skin, you have an open fracture and you will need surgery to repair it. Make sure to wash the entire area with antiseptic soap.It will be easy for any open wounds around your broken bone to become infected which will make the injury much more complicated to treat.


It may hurt to wash your tender knuckle, but it’s very important that you do.
Make sure to dry your wound completely as moisture makes it easier for bacteria to grow. You can also cover the wound with a clean dressing to prevent infection.
Remove any loose pieces of material from the injury. If there is an impaled object in your knuckle, leave it in place for the doctors to remove in the hospital.

, Try to bend your injured finger to check for dislocation or malrotation of your knuckle. If your knuckle is dislocated, you may not be able to bend it at all as the bone will have moved in a way that does not allow you to use your finger. If the bone has rotated, you might be able to bend the finger, but it will be pointed towards your thumb. Malrotation means that the bone has twisted in such a way that the finger will bend in a different direction than normal.If your bone is dislocated or malrotated, you will need a doctor to reset it.
A malrotated or dislocated knuckle often takes longer to heal than a simple broken knuckle.

, If your knuckle is broken it will be very difficult for you to close your hand. You can test the severity of your injury by trying to make a fist. Your hand may have swollen too large or it may simply be too painful for you to move your fingers if your knuckle is broken. You may also be able to close all your fingers except for the one with the broken knuckle. If you can make a fist, and your knuckle is broken, your injured finger may not align properly with the rest of your fingers.Don’t push yourself. If you try too hard to fight through the pain and make a fist, you could injure or dislocate your knuckle further.

, A broken knuckle will drastically reduce your finger strength. Your brain can shut down the muscles around a severe injury to prevent further damage. If you find yourself unable to get a tight grip on anything, there’s a chance your brain is trying to protect your broken knuckle.If you have a minor fracture of your knuckle, you may still be able to use most of your grip. If you suspect you might have a fracture though, take it easy. Gripping something too hard could cause the fracture to become more severe.

, Your knuckle is at the top of your metacarpal bone. The bottom of your metacarpal bone is connected to your carpus or wrist bone.Because the two bones are connected, a broken knuckle can affect the mobility of your wrist. Move your wrist from side to side and up and down. If you feel a sharp pain shoot through your hand, you most likely have a severe broken knuckle.

, If you suspect that your knuckle is broken, then see a doctor or visit an emergency room as soon as possible to get treated. You will probably have to wear a splint or brace for a few weeks until the knuckle heals.Casts are not often necessary for breaks in the hand and fingers."

This is often used in medical settings to ensure adhesion of heart monitor pads and the like.Rubbing alcohol may be somewhat less effective, but will help in removing oils from the skin and preparing it for good adhesion. Use only a little and let the skin dry after, however, because rubbing alcohol can also dissolve bandage adhesives.;
, No matter how well you prepare your skin, a bandage invariably sticks better to itself than it will to your flesh. Your odds of keeping a wet bandage in place will improve any time that you are able to overlap the adhesive strips.


The most likely spot for an overlapping bandage is of course a finger. But, a bandage that is stuck to itself can still easily slide off a finger. To reduce this possibility, make sure to wrap the bandage tightly, though not so much that it restricts blood flow (if your fingertip turns purple or starts to hurt, it’s too tight).
Another trick for keeping a bandage on the finger in place involves cutting into the adhesive strips on either side of the pad, then creating a criss-cross pattern with the four adhesive strips you now have., Few if any of the many brands of so-called waterproof bandages can actually make good on that claim, so their effectiveness at keeping water borne dirt and germs out of a wound is questionable at best. However, they do tend to stick around a bit better than regular bandages.Waterproof bandages tend to have a stronger adhesive, which can help keep them in place longer when exposed to moisture. In fact, some brands tend to leave some adhesive residue on the skin when removed.
Keep in mind, though, that the main task of a bandage is to keep germs out, and standard waterproof adhesive bandages tend to fail at keeping potentially germ-filled liquids from reaching a covered wound. They need to be regularly replaced, just like a normal adhesive bandage, even if they do stick better.

, If you really want to hold a bandage in place and aren’t concerned with concealing its existence, you can reinforce its positioning with either adhesive or non-adhesive wrappings.For a larger bandage on a knee, for instance, you might try a roller bandage made of stretchy fabric. Wrap it snugly around the adhesive bandage (but not so tight that it hinders blood flow), then hold it in place with some medical tape (or similar fabric tape).
For smaller bandages, you can use the fabric adhesive tape alone to help hold the bandage in place. This could make removal uncomfortable, however, so remember the tips for removing bandages with less pain.
Once again, however, do not use this reinforcement as an excuse not to replace your bandage frequently, especially once it gets substantially wet.

, Some people still believe that it is better to let a minor cut or scrape dry out and scab over, but that has been proven false. A moist, protected wound heals better, so the job of the bandage is to keep the wound from drying out and external moisture (which can carry germs) from getting in.When you have a minor cut or scrape, clean the area thoroughly with soap and water only, then pat it dry with a clean cloth and apply a bandage that covers the entire wound (with some room to spare) and fits snugly over it.
The effectiveness of your bandage in sealing out germs reduces substantially when it gets wet, since moisture can seep through or underneath the bandage. Try to keep the bandage dry whenever possible.

, Even if you shudder at the thought of ripping that bandage off your forearm (along with a tuft of arm hair), you should replace any bandage at least once a day. Just because a bandage is still stuck in place after twenty four hours doesn’t mean it is wise to let it stick around longer.Replace a bandage as soon as practical whenever it gets dirty or soaking wet. Most of the tips here for keeping a wet bandage in place should only really be used as temporary measures until you have the opportunity to replace the bandage.
Replacing bandages frequently not only helps reduce germ infiltration, it lets you keep track of the healing process. That way, you won’t keep a bandage on any longer than necessary.

, When it is practical to do so, the best way to keep a bandage (and the wound underneath) dry is to place a barrier between it and external moisture. If you’re going to be outside in wet conditions, even items of clothing like long pants or wide-brimmed hats can offer some assistance.


For a wound on your hand, for instance, you can put on a disposable glove while preparing food.You could also try it while showering, or even resort to a plastic bag cinched up at the wrist.
You could try out the plastic bag in the shower for a foot or lower leg bandage as well. It won’t keep all the water out, but it will deflect much of it.

, If you can’t avoid getting the bandaged area wet, and you can’t get your regular or waterproof bandages to stay in place, there are other options to consider. Using them may buy you some extra time between re-bandaging applications.


Hydrocolloid dressings create a water-tight seal around the wound, which keeps more germs out and tends to keep them in place longer. They are often used in hospital settings to keep IV lines in place and for post-surgical care, but can also be purchased for home use.Liquid bandages (such as cyanoacrylate) work almost like a waterproof glue placed over the wound. This treatment may not be practical for all wounds, but will stay put and do its job well for most minor cuts and scrapes."

Look for signs of a spinal injury.,
Begin CPR if the injured person is not breathing.,
Administer basic first aid if the person is bleeding.,
Determine how many bystanders are available to log roll.,
Get positioned over the injured person.,
Get the spinal board or sheet / tarp ready.,
Coordinate the log roll.,
Position the spinal board / sheet underneath and lower the person.,
Place a spinal board underneath.,
Use a sheet to transport.,
Prevent choking on vomit or blood.",How to Logroll an Injured Person During First Aid," If you suspect a spinal injury to the back or neck of a person in need of help, do not move him or her if there is no immediate need to (see below for reasons). Assume an injured person has a spinal injury if: they are unconscious or losing consciousness; they complain of severe spinal pain (neck of back); they can't move their neck or limbs; they feel weakness or numbness in their limbs; they lose control of their bowel or bladder; their spine is positioned oddly of crooked; they've fallen from a significant height or been hit by something substantial.








Permanent paralysis and other serious life-threatening complications can result from moving a person with a spinal injury — even a mild one initially.
Assume a spinal injury whenever a person is hit by a car or falls from a height greater than 10 feet. It's always better to error on the side of caution.;
, Regardless if you think an injured person has a spinal injury or not, you need to administer CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) if they are unconscious and not breathing. If the injured person shows no signs of circulation (no wrist / neck pulse, breathing, coughing or movement), begin CPR immediately with at least 30 chest pumps and then a couple of breaths into their mouth. However, don't tilt the head back to open the airway (as is recommended with CPR) if you suspect a neck injury.Instead, use your fingers to gently grasp the jaw and lift it forward before giving emergency breaths.









Repeat this CPR cycle (30 compressions / 2 breaths) until resuscitated or until medical help arrives
If a person has no heart beat and is not breathing they are already considered dead, so resuscitating them is a higher priority than avoiding a potentially worse spinal cord injury.
Before administering CPR, call 9-1-1 or an emergency number to get medical help on the way as soon as possible.

, If an injured person is bleeding, then provide as much basic first aid as possible without moving their head or neck.Rinse away any dirt and debris from wounds with clean (preferably distilled) water. Put pressure against any bleeding wounds with a clean (preferably sterilized) cloth or bandage. Leave any large puncture items in the wound as removing them may lead to much more bleeding.


Splinting any broken bones should only be done by trained professionals or in cases where medical help may not be available for long durations.
Keep the injured person warm (with a blanket or a jacket) and hydrated to prevent or delay them going into shock.

, If you determine the injured person absolutely needs to be rolled on their side in order to be moved or to prevent choking, then determine how many people are around who want to help. The more people around (up to five), the better because more hands can stabilize the injured person while log rolling them and prevent unwanted spinal motion.If you're the only person to log roll, then you better have an excellent reason to proceed instead of waiting for paramedics to arrive.









A minimum of at least two people are needed to log roll an injured person in an emergency — one to stabilize the neck / head, and one to stabilize the lower spine / pelvis.
Five or six people is the ideal number to log roll in most situations in order to stabilize the neck / head, arms, low back / pelvis and legs.

, Whoever emerges as the leader should position themselves at the injured person's head (assuming they're already on their back) and coordinate the timing of the log roll. The person at the head stabilizes the neck (cervical spine) by firmly grasping the side of the head over the ears, lower jaw and at the base of the skull.Others should hold and stabilize the arms / thoracic spine, lumbar spine / pelvis and legs around the knees.









If the injured person is still conscious, keep them still and assure them they're going to be okay to keep them calm.
If you have any towels, blankets or extra clothes around, wrap them up and place them on both sides of the neck to provide support and prevent movement.Explain to any inexperienced helpers what you're about to do (log roll) and how to do it. These uninjured volunteer helpers may also need some calming down.

, If you are log rolling the injured person onto a spinal board or sheet / tarp in order to be moved, then get it ready by positioning it right next to the side you're planning on lifting off the ground.Remember that you'll need an extra person to push the spinal board or sheet under the victim once they are on their side.









A helper who's stabilizing the injured person cannot let go before the log roll is complete.
Determine what side is best for the injured person to be rolled onto. This might be determined by the landscape of where the person has fallen or if they appear to have a broken arm of dislocated shoulder.
A spinal board should be designed for carrying a person towards an ambulance. If you have to make one, make sure its flat and can support at least a few hundred pounds — thick plywood works well.

, The leader should coordinate the timing of the roll once everybody is in position and stabilizing their designated body segment. Announce on the count of three that everybody should slowly roll the person onto an agreed upon side (right or left). At the end of the count, slowly roll the person without completely lifting them off the ground.Stop while they're on their side and don't let them roll onto their stomach, which can torque and extend the spinal column.









Ideally the victim's head and neck should remain in a straight line axis with the rest of their spine and pelvis during the log roll.
Research shows that it's best to keep a person's arms pinned against their sides (palms against their thighs) while log rolling them — it reduces spinal movement., Once the injured person is on their side, have someone quickly push the spinal board or sheet directly underneath them. Position it so that the victim's body will completely cover the board and be as close to its center as possible. The head and feet should eventually be secured to the spinal board (ideally), so don't leave any of the body hanging over the edge. Once the board or sheet is properly positioned, roll the person onto it carefully, beginning on the agreed upon count again.









The person at the top of the injured person should continue to hold the head and support the cervical spine until the emergency medical personnel arrive with a special immobilizing neck support / collar.
The injured person can now be transported to a waiting emergency vehicle (ambulance or helicopter) or away from danger.
At least two strong people are needed to lift and carry an injured person on a spinal board, although four is ideal.

, A log roll involves partially rolling a person (usually from their back to their side) so that a long spinal board can be wedged underneath them.Once the spinal board is underneath the injured person and they are laying on their back, they can be lifted by paramedics and carried to an ambulance or other emergency transport vehicle. Transporting a person on a spinal board minimizes movement to their spine and reduces risk of further injury if they have a spinal injury.


The log roll obviously involves some movement to the spine, but it's the safest way to transfer a person onto a spinal board if there is only a few people available.
If there's at least five other people around able to help you, doing a 6-person lift procedure onto a spinal board is considered a little safer than a log roll due to less impact on the spinal column., Another reason to log roll an injured / unconscious person is to remove them from immediate danger or threat of further injury if they remained in the same spot.If emergency medical personnel aren't present with a spinal board and you need to transport a person away from danger, log roll them to the side and place a sturdy sheet, blanket, tarp etc. under them, then lift it and carry it with the injured person on their back.


You'll need at least one other person to help you carry it and preferably three others.
Reasons to move an injured person before paramedics arrive include: proximity to fire, exposure to cold, risk of flooding, surrounding violence and/or potential danger from animals.
If you're all alone with an injured person and absolutely need to move them, then place a sheet / tarp under them and drag it along the ground towards safety — it's not ideal, but likely the best method.

, Another reason to log roll an injured / unconscious person is to prevent them from choking on their own blood or vomit.People who bite their tongue or lose teeth during an accident or trauma have a significant risk of choking on their blood, particularly if they're unconscious and laying on their back. The same holds true for vomiting, which is a common occurrence when you feel severe pain and have lots of adrenaline suddenly released into your bloodstream.


Rolling a person onto their side allows for all liquids (blood, vomit, mucus, saliva) to safely drain from their mouth, instead of down their trachea and into their lungs.
A person positioned on their side is also less likely to bite their tongue or choke on it, compared to laying on their back (supine).

Bring the container of the potential poison with you.",How to Induce Vomiting1," There is no reason to induce vomiting at home. If you or someone you’re with may have been poisoned, call the Poison Help Hotline at 1-800-222-1222 from anywhere in the United States. This number will connect you with a poison control center staffed by professionals that will provide you with free and confidential advice.Call this number at any time for any questions about poisoning or poison prevention.
Outside of the U.S., look up the number for poison control in your country and call them immediately. For instance, the number to call in Australia is 13 11 26.
People can be poisoned by chemicals, taking too much medication, and even too much of a certain food. If you think you or someone else may have been poisoned, do not hesitate to call Poison Control.;
, Poison control personnel will ask you questions about what has been consumed, as well as any symptoms that have developed. If they direct you to go to an emergency room, do so immediately.Again, do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so.

, If you have a good idea what may have caused the poisoning, such as a bottle of pills, bring this with you. It will provide medical personnel with valuable information that can help them treat the poisoning victim."
"
Avoid emetics unless directed to take them.,
Do not drink salt water.,
Take caution with other home remedies.,
Avoid potentially dangerous substances.",How to Induce Vomiting2," Over the counter emetics, or medicines that can make you throw up, should be avoided unless a medical professional directs you to take some as a last resort. Ipecac syrup, for instance, was once commonly used to induce vomiting. However, it has been shown that medications such as these can complicate treatment for poisoning. In fact, ipecac is no longer produced for over-the-counter sales., While salt water is a classic home remedy to induce vomiting, it may actually pose a risk to a poisoning victim. This is because drinking salt water can push toxic substances further into the digestive track and speed up absorption of the substance in the process.Furthermore, drinking large amounts of salt water may cause serious health complications, including death.

, Folk methods of inducing vomiting include drinking mustard or raw eggs, or eating large amount of food. The safety and effectiveness of these methods has not been proven. For instance, eating a large amount of food to induce vomiting may actually speed up absorption of a poisonous substance., There are a handful of substances that can induce vomiting but are not recommended. These include activated charcoal, atropine, biperiden, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, scopolamine, copper sulfate, bloodroot, lobelia tincture , and hydrogen peroxide."
"
Rinse your mouth after vomiting.,
Do not brush your teeth.,
Continue following poison control’s directions.",How to Induce Vomiting3," There will likely be a bad taste in your mouth after vomiting that you want to remove. To do so, rinse your mouth with as much warm water as is necessary., Brushing your teeth immediately after vomiting can cause damage to your tooth enamel. This is because corrosive gastric acid may have been brought into your mouth when you vomited., Do whatever poison control tells you to do. They will likely direct you to drink water, but may direct you to hold off on eating or drinking for a while. If they tell you to go to the hospital, do so, even if you think you threw up most of whatever was bothering your stomach."

These signs may include a sudden onset of::Numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body. One side of the face may drop when the person tries to smile.
Confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech, slurring words.
Trouble seeing in one or both eyes, blackened vision or seeing double.
Severe headache, usually with no known cause and possibly with vomiting
Trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination and dizziness;
, In addition to the typical symptoms of stroke, women may also experience unique symptoms. These can include:Weakness
Shortness of breath
Sudden behavior change or agitation
Nausea and vomiting
Hiccups
Hallucinations

, Does one side of the face droop?
A- ARMS: Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?
S- SPEECH: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is his speech slurred or strange?
T- TIME: If you observe any of these signs, call 9-1-1 immediately.

, If you suspect a stroke, call 911 immediately. Every minute counts in a stroke. For every minute untreated, one can lose 1.9 million neurons, which reduces chances for successful recovery and increases chances of complications or death.In addition, there is a small treatment window for ischemic strokes, so it is important t get to the hospital as soon as possible.
Some hospitals have stroke care facilities that are especially well-equipped to treat strokes. If you are at risk of having a stroke, then it might be beneficial to find out where these centers are located., Strokes can happen to anyone, however some people are more likely to get them. Talk to your doctor about your increased risk for stroke due to these health conditions:Diabetes
Heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation (a-fib) or stenosis
Prior stroke or TIA

, If you have a lifestyle that does not prioritize exercise and healthy eating, you may have an increased risk of stroke. Some of the lifestyle habits that might increase your risk include:Being overweight or obesity
Physical inactivity
Heavy drinking or illicit drug use
Smoking
High blood pressure
High cholesterol

, There are certain unavoidable risks that you may be facing. These include:


Your age: after 55 years old, your risk doubles for every decade
Your ethnicity or race: African Americans, Hispanics and Asians have a higher risk of stroke
Women have a slightly higher risk
Your family history of stroke

, There are other factors that can impact a woman’s risk of stroke. These include:Birth control pills: Oral contraceptives can increase stroke risk, especially when other risk factors are present such as smoking or having high blood pressure.
Being pregnant: This increases blood pressure and stress on the heart.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Women often do hormone replacement therapy to relieve the symptoms of menopause.
Migraines with aura: More women than men suffer from migraines, and migraines are associated with increased stroke risk.

, A stroke happens when the blood supply to your brain, along with oxygen and nutrients, is blocked or reduced. This can cause your brain cells to start dying almost immediately.Prolonged deprivation of blood supply can cause extensive brain death and therefore long-term disability.

, Most strokes fall into one of two categories: ischemic and hemorrhagic. An ischemic (iss-KEE-mick) stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks blood supply. Most (about 80%) of strokes are ischemic.A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a rupture of a weakened blood vessel in the brain. This causes blood to leak out in the brain.

, These types of strokes, also known as TIAs, are mini-strokes. This stroke is caused by a “temporary” blockage of the blood supply to the brain. For example, a small moving clot can block a vessel temporarily. Although the symptoms are the same as for a more severe stroke, they last for a shorter period of time, usually less than five minutes.The symptoms appear and disappear within 24 hours.However, you cannot tell whether you experienced a TIA or stroke only by timing and symptoms.
It is crucial to get emergency care regardless, since having a TIA is an indication of a future probability of a stroke.

, Disabilities after a stroke can range from problems moving (paralysis), problems thinking, speaking, memory loss etc. They can be mild to severe depending on how serious the stroke (size of clot, extent of brain damage) was and how long it took for the patient to receive treatment.

Carry the person in the stretcher.",How to Make a Simple Stretcher," To make a simple stretcher, you will need a long, wide tarp or a wool blanket. Try to find a tarp or blanket that is at least 8 feet wide and 8 feet long (2.4 meters x 2.4 meters), as you will need to fold it to make the stretcher.If you cannot find a large blanket, you can try putting together two smaller blankets so they are at least 8 feet by 8 feet (2.4 meters x 2.4 meters).;
, While you don't need to use poles to create a simple stretcher, they will make your stretcher sturdier. You will also need two poles that are of equal length and at least 8 feet long (2.4 meters). Look for wooden poles that are at least two inches thick, as this will ensure they are sturdy. You can use wooden poles that you cut down from a tree and shave down to be the same length and width. Or you may use metal poles.Make sure the poles are equal in length, as you do not want a lopsided stretcher. The poles should also be sturdy enough to hold some weight, as they will act as supports for both sides of the stretcher.
If you do not have poles, you can make a very simple stretcher with just a blanket.

, You may decide to have a roll of duct tape on hand in case you want to secure the stretcher with the tape once you have put it together. If you are using a wool blanket, you may not need duct tape to secure the stretcher, as the friction between the two ends of the wool blanket will keep it in place. If you are using a tarp, you may decide to use the tape to secure the stretcher., Start by spreading out the blanket or tarp on an even surface, such as the floor. Make sure no corners are folded over and the blanket is laying flat.


You may also place the two poles next to the blanket so they are easy to access., You will first need to check that the blanket and the poles are around the same length. This will ensure there is no extra material hanging off the sides of the stretcher.


Measure the length of the stretcher by placing one of the poles on the blanket lengthwise. If the pole is not in line with the end of the blanket, you may need to fold over the end or both ends of the blanket so the blanket is around the same length as the poles.
You may make the blanket about one to two inches shorter than the length of the poles so some of the pole sticks out on either end of the blanket. This will make it easier to hold and lift the poles once you use the stretcher.

, Once you have confirmed the length of the blanket, you will need to determine how wide the stretcher is going to be. Start by placing one pole lengthwise about two feet from the edge of the blanket. Then, consider how wide you want the stretcher to be. If you are trying to fit someone who is of average weight and height, you may place the other pole lengthwise two feet away (0.7 meters) from the first pole.If you are trying to fit someone who is a bit bigger or wider, you may space out the poles so there are three feet (0.9 meters) between the two poles. Try not to make the distance between the two poles too big, as you will need enough material on either side of the poles to fold over the poles.

, Now that the poles are in place, you will take one end of the blanket and fold it over the poles. It may only cover one of the poles and lay just behind the second pole. This is fine. Make sure the blanket lays flat over the poles.Then, take the other end of the blanket and fold it over the other pole. The two ends of the blanket should overlap each other. Make sure the poles stay straight lengthwise as you fold over the blanket.
If you are not using poles, then you will wait until the person is on the blanket before doing anything to the sides., The two ends of the blanket should create enough friction to stay together on their own. If you want to make sure the stretcher is secure, you may use duct tape to secure the two ends of the blanket or the tarp. You may use one long strip of tape to keep the two ends of the blanket or the tarp together., To put an injured person on the stretcher, you should first move the stretcher so it is only a few feet away from the injured person. If the person is on a bed or a raised area, try to place the stretcher just below the person. This will make it easier to transfer the person to the stretcher., Tell the person, “We are going to move you onto the stretcher now.” You may then need someone to help you carefully slide or lift the person towards the stretcher. If the person is able to lift themselves up with their arms, they may do so and lay themselves down on the stretcher.If the person is lying down on a bed with a sheet, you may have the person cross their arms over their chest. Then, you may have someone help you lift the sheet the person is lying on, cradling the person, and place it on the stretcher.
If the person has any head injuries, have a third person hold the person's head steady as they are lifted so their head does not shift or move around.
Place the person in the middle of the blanket.

, Once the person is situated on the stretcher, you should have one person raise the back end, closest to the person’s head, with their body facing forward. The other person should raise the front end of the stretcher, closest to the person’s legs, with their body facing away from the person on the stretcher.Then, you may count together ""1, 2, 3"" and lift the person on the stretcher on ""3."" This will make it easier to lift the stretcher evenly and bring the person to safety.
If you are not using poles, then you will need two people on each side of the blanket. Have the partners on each side roll up a few inches of the blanket on their side until the roll is thick enough to grasp and hold onto. As one unit, all four people will lift the blanket together to transport the person., You and the other person may try to coordinate your movements so the stretcher stays even and steady. This could be done by counting each step you take together out loud or by trying to find a rhythm to walk to so you are both walking at the same pace.Make sure you keep a good grip on the stretcher poles and the person carrying the other end of the stretcher does the same. You do not want the injured person in the stretcher to be bounced around, as this could lead to further injuries.

Monitor the victim continuously.",How to Identify Symptoms of a Head Injury," Head trauma can happen to any person who bumps, bangs, or scratches his or her head. Injuries can happen as a result of car accidents, falls, collisions with other individuals, or simply bumping your head. Although most head trauma results in minor injuries and don’t require hospitalization, it’s still important to check yourself or any person after a mishap. This can help ensure that you don’t have a serious or potentially life-threatening head injury., If you or another person have any type of accident or mishap that involves their head or face, take a few minutes to do a thorough search for external injuries.This can alert you to injuries that require immediate attention and first aid as well as any that may become a more serious problem. Make sure to thoroughly check every part of the head using your eyes and by gently touching the skin. Such signs might include:


Bleeding from cuts or abrasions, which can be severe because the head more blood vessels than any other part of your body
Bleeding or fluid leakage from the nose or ears
Black-and-blue discoloration below the eyes or ears
Bruising
Bulging bumps, sometimes called “goose eggs”Foreign objects lodged in the head.

, In additions to bleeding and bumps, there are other physical signs that a person may have a head injury. Many of these can indicate a serious external or internal injury. The signs may be present immediately or develop over the course of a few hours or days and require immediate medical attention. Make sure to watch yourself or another person for:


Cessation of breathing
Severe or worsening headache
Loss of balance
Loss of consciousness
Weakness
Inability to use an arm or leg
Unequal pupil size or abnormal eye movements
Seizures
Persistent crying in children
Loss of appetite
Nausea or vomiting
Lightheadedness or spinning sensationsTemporary ringing in the ears
Becoming very sleepy, Physical signs of injury are often the easiest way to identify a head injury. In some cases, you may see no apparent cuts or bumps or even experience headache.However, there are other potentially serious signs of head injury for which you should watch. Seek medical attention if you see any of the following cognitive symptoms of head injury:


Memory loss
Changes in moodConfusion or disorientationSlurred speechSensitivity to light, sound, or distractions., It’s important to recognize that you may not detect any symptoms of a brain injury. The signs may also be subtle and not appear for several days or weeks following the trauma. For this reasons, it’s important to keep watch on your health or that of a person who had any type of accident related to the head.Ask friends or family members if they have noticed any potential symptoms in your behavior or can see visible physical signs such as discolored skin.

, If you recognize any symptoms of a head injury and/ or have any doubts about it, see a doctor or call emergency services. This can ensure that you do not have any serious or life-threatening injuries and get proper treatment.Call emergency services if you notice any of the following signs: severe head or facial bleeding, severe headache, loss of consciousness or breath, seizures, repeated vomiting, weakness, confusion, unequal pupil size, or black and blue discoloration below the eyes and ears.See your doctor within a day or two of any serious head injury, even if it didn’t require emergency attention. Make sure to tell your doctor about how the injury occurred and any measures you’ve taken to relieve it at home, including pain medications or administering basic first aid.Be aware that the precise identification of the type and severity of a head injury are next-to-impossible for a first aider to assess. Internal injuries require assessment by medical specialists at appropriate medical facilities.

, If someone has a head injury and is conscious, it’s important to stabilize his or her head while you are providing care or waiting for medical attention. Placing your hands on both sides of the person’s head can keep it from moving and causing further injury as well as allow you to provide any necessary first aid.Place a rolled up coat, blankets, or articles of clothing next to a victim’s head to stabilize it if you are providing first aid.
Keep the person as still as possible with the head and shoulders slightly elevated.Avoid removing any helmet a victim is wearing to prevent further injury.
Avoid shaking a person, even if he or she seems confused or loses consciousness. You can simply tap the person without moving him or her.

, If there is any bleeding with either a serious or non-serious injury, it’s important to control it. Apply clean bandages or cloths to get bleeding from any type of head injury.Use firm pressure to apply the bandages or cloths unless you suspect a skull fracture. In this case, simply cover the bleeding site with a sterile dressing.
Avoid removing bandages or cloths. If the wound bleeds through any dressings, simply place a new one over the old cloth. You should also avoid removing any debris from the wound. If there is a lot of debris, lightly cover the wound with bandages.
Be aware that you should never wash a head wound that is bleeding a lot or is very deep.

, There may be vomiting present with some head injuries. If you’ve stabilized the head and the person begins vomiting, you’ll need to prevent choking. Rolling the person on to his or her side as one unit can minimize the risk of choking by vomiting.Make sure to support the person’s head, neck, and spine as you roll the individual to the side.

, If you or another person has swelling at the site of a head injury, use ice packs to reduce it. This can control inflammation and any pain or discomfort the person is experiencing.Place ice on injury for 20 minutes at a time up to three to five times a day. Remember to get medical attention if the swelling doesn’t decrease within a day or two. If the swelling gets worse, is accompanied by vomiting and/ or severe headache, seek immediate medical attention.
Use a commercial ice pack or fashion one with a bag of frozen vegetables or fruit. Remove if it gets too cold or causes you pain. Putting a towel or cloth between your skin and the pack can prevent discomfort and frostbite.

, If a person injured his or her head, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on the person for a few days or until medical professionals arrive. This can alert you to provide assistance if the person’s vital signs change. It can also reassure and calm the injured person.


Watch for any changing in the person’s breathing and alertness. If the person stops breathing, begin CPR if you are able.Keep talking to the person to reassure him or her, which can also help you recognize and changes to speech or cognitive ability.
Make sure any victim of a head injury avoids alcohol consumption for 48 hours. Alcohol can obscure potential signs of serious injury or a deterioration in the person’s condition.Remember to get medical attention if you are unsure about any change in the condition of someone with a head injury.

Fill the Ziploc bags.,
Freeze the package.,
Make an ice pack cover.",How to Make a Homemade Ice Pack1," Pour a 2:1 mixture of water and rubbing alcohol into a Ziploc freezer bag until it is 3/4 full. If desired, add a few drops of food coloring to customize the color of your homemade ice pack. Remove as much air as possible and seal the bag tightly; put it into a second Ziploc freezer bag to ensure that the liquid doesn’t leak out.If you do not have rubbing alcohol on hand, consider alternative ingredients to make an ice pack, such as dish soap (on its own, no water necessary) or corn syrup.
Be careful to keep your materials and ingredients away from infants and small children. Rubbing alcohol is dangerous if consumed in large enough quantities and it can also cause irritation to the eyes. Plastic bags also pose a suffocation risk to babies and small children.;
, Place the liquid-filled Ziploc bags into the freezer. Leave for two to three hours to freeze. Given the different freezing points of water and alcohol, the solution will develop into a gel.Gel icepacks can mold to the contours of your body, which may provide better relief than a traditional ice pack., Before applying your homemade ice pack, you should cover it to avoid direct contact with your skin. Find some thick, comfortable material (e.g. from an old flannel shirt) and cut out a piece that is an inch (2.5 cm) wider than your ice pack, and twice the length of the ice pack, plus an inch. Fold the material by bringing the ends to meet (and overlap) in the middle. Sew together the top and bottom, lengthwise. Leave the middle part open to easily insert and remove the ice pack."
"
Choose a cover.,
Fill up the pouch.,
Seal and freeze.",How to Make a Homemade Ice Pack2," Customize your ice pack by choosing the material and dimensions. For an easy option, choose an old, clean sock; pillowcases and other material pouches are also good options, provided that the material is tightly knit and the sides are closed up. You can also purchase material and sew something yourself.


A benefit of making a rice ice pack is that you can also use it as a moist heat pack by microwaving it for one to three minutes., Fill up your ice pack cover with raw rice. Fill it approximately ¾ full so that the filling will disperse evenly when applied to skin while maintaining its density. Add a few drops of essential oil if desired (e.g. lavender oil, to enhance relaxation).You can substitute dried beans for rice, if needed.

, Sew up the end of the ice pack. Make sure that all of the edges are shut tightly, and that there are no small holes in the material where the rice might fall out. Freeze the ice pack for two to three hours, or until chilled.

Soak the sponge.,
Seal the pack.,
Freeze and use.",How to Make a Homemade Ice Pack3," Choose a clean, thick sponge large enough to cover the area you want to apply a cold compress to. Opt for a sponge without an abrasive side for scrubbing. To cover a greater area, use a second sponge as well. Run the sponge under water until it is soaked through., Place the wet sponge (or sponges) in a freezer bag to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the freezer. Remove excess air from the freezer bag. Seal the bag tightly and place it in the freezer.

, Freeze the pack for several hours. The pack will be stiff when you first remove it from the freezer, so thaw it for a few minutes if you want it to be flexible when used. The sponge will soften gradually as you use it."

Take note of any discomfort in your chest or back.,
Identify any discomfort in your upper body.,
Look for any dizziness and/or lightheadedness.,
Notice shortness of breath.,
Watch for any gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, indigestion, and vomiting.,
Consider whether you had difficulty catching your breath upon waking.,
Think about whether you’re feeling anxious.,
Look for weakness and fatigue.",How to Identify Female Heart Attack Symptoms1," One of the main symptoms of a heart attack is a sensation of heaviness, tightness, squeezing, or pressure in the chest or upper back. This pain may not be sudden or severe. It may last for a few minutes, then go away and come back.Some people mistake heart attack pain for heartburn or indigestion. If this pain does not start soon after eating, if you do not usually have heartburn, or if it is accompanied by nausea (feeling like you are going to vomit), you need to visit the emergency room.;
, Women suffering from a heart attack may experience sharp pain that resembles a toothache or earache in the jaw, neck, shoulder or back. This pain occurs because the nerves supplying these areas are also supplying the heart.This pain may come and go for a while before it becomes more intense. It may even be so intense that it wakes you up during the night.These pains may be felt in each location at once, or in only some of the locations listed.
Women often don't experience pain in their arm or shoulder men often report when they have a heart attack.

, If you suddenly feel faint, your heart may not be getting the blood it needs. If shortness of breath or a cold sweat accompanies the dizziness (feeling as if the room is spinning) or lightheadedness (feeling like you may faint), you could be having a heart attack. Decreased blood flow to the brain causes these symptoms., If you feel winded all of a sudden, this could be a sign of a heart attack. Feeling winded means that you feel as if you cannot catch your breath. If you are feeling short of breath, try breathing through pursed lips (as if you are going to whistle). You use less energy when you breathe this way. This method of breathing may also help you feel more relaxed and lessen the ""shortness of breath"" feeling.When you have a heart attack, the blood pressure in your lungs and heart rise while the pumping function of the heart decreases.

, Gastrointestinal symptoms are more common symptoms of a heart attack for women than for men. These symptoms are often overlooked by women as the result of stress or the flu.It is the result of poor circulation and and a lack of oxygen in the blood. The feelings of nausea and indigestion may last for a while., Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the soft tissues in the mouth, such as the tongue and throat, block the upper airway.A sleep apnea diagnosis means that you stop breathing for at least 10 seconds repeatedly while asleep. This interruption in the breathing process decreases the blood flow from the heart.
Research from Yale University suggests that sleep apnea increases the risk of dying or of having a heart attack by 30 percent (over a five-year period).If you wake and cannot catch your breath, you could be having a heart attack.

, Sweating, shortness of breath and a rapid heartbeat (racing heart) frequently occur with anxiety. These symptoms are also common with a heart attack. If you suddenly feel anxious (restless), this could be your nerves reacting to the overexertion of your heart.The anxiety may also cause insomnia for some women., Though fatigue is a common symptom of many conditions, including a busy week at work, fatigue can also be caused by a decreased flow of blood to your brain. If you are having difficulty completing your daily tasks because you need to stop and rest (more than usual), blood may not be pumping through your body at its regular rate, and may indicate that you are at risk for a heart attack. Some women also report a feeling of heaviness in their legs in the weeks or months leading up to a heart attack."
"
Know that women are more likely to die from a heart attack.,
Recognize the difference between a heart attack and a panic attack.,
Seek medical assistance if you experience symptoms of panic attack, but have previously had a heart attack.",How to Identify Female Heart Attack Symptoms2," Women who have a heart attack are more likely to die as a result of delayed treatment or misdiagnosis. If you think that you are having a heart attack, make sure that you say so when you call 911. This will help to ensure that your doctor will consider the possibility of a heart attack, even if your symptoms are not typical heart attack symptoms.Do not delay treatment if you think you may be having a heart attack or having heart problems.

, A panic attack usually occurs because of a stressful situation. What actually causes an individual to suffer with panic disorder is unknown; however, this condition tends to run in families. Women and individuals in their 20s or 30s are at higher risk for suffering panic attacks. Symptoms that are commonly experienced during a panic attack, but are not common during a heart attack include:


Intense terror
Sweaty palms
Flushed face
Chills
Muscle twitching
Feeling like you need to escape
Fear of ‘”going crazy”
Hot flashes
Trouble swallowing, or a tightness in your throat
Headache
These symptoms may end within five minutes, or may peak after 20 minutes.

, If anyone who has previously experienced a heart attack has any of the symptoms listed above, they should visit the emergency room. An individual who has been diagnosed with a panic disorder and is concerned about suffering a heart attack should request a cardiac evaluation."
"
Stay with the victim and help him remain calm.,
Do not encourage the victim to try to vomit up the gasoline.,
Give the victim a glass of water or juice to drink after rinsing the mouth with water.,
Contact your local poison control center and explain the situation.,
Help the victim get any gasoline off of his skin.,
Make sure the victim does not smoke for at least 72 hours, and do not smoke around the victim.,
Reassure the victim that burping up gasoline fumes is normal.,
Launder any gasoline stained clothing.,
Get the gasoline away from the person.,
Assume that a child who has swallowed any amount of gasoline is in danger.,
Call Emergency Services.,
Monitor the victim closely.,
If the victim stops breathing, coughing or moving, and does not respond to your voice, begin CPR immediately.",How to Help Someone Who Has Swallowed Gasoline," Reassure him that people ingest small amounts of gasoline all the time, and are usually just fine. Encourage the victim to take deep, calming breaths and relax., Small amounts of gasoline causes little harm once it reaches the stomach, but inhaling even a few drops of gasoline into the lungs can cause serious respiratory problems. Vomiting greatly increases the chances that a person will aspirate (inhale) gasoline into his lungs, and must be avoided.If the victim vomits spontaneously, help him to lean forward to prevent aspiration. Have him rinse his mouth with water after vomiting and immediately contact Poison Control and Emergency Services., Encourage him to drink slowly to avoid coughing or choking. If the victim is not conscious or able to drink on his own, do not try to administer fluids and call Emergency Services immediately.


Do not give the victim milk unless directed to do so by the Poison Control center, as milk can cause the body to absorb the gasoline more quickly.Carbonated beverages should also be avoided, as they may make the burping worse.
Avoid drinking alcohol for at least 24 hours.

, In the United States, the number is 1-800-222-1222. If the victim is experiencing acute distress, including coughing, difficulty breathing, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, or anything more severe, call Emergency Services right away., The victim should remove any clothing that came in contact with the gasoline. Set the clothing aside and rinse any affected skin with plain water for 2-3 minutes, then wash with mild soap. Rinse the skin again thoroughly and dry., Gasoline and gasoline vapors are extremely flammable, and smoking could lead to a fire. Cigarette smoke can also exacerbate any damage done to the victim's lungs by the gasoline., This could continue for as little as 24 hours to as long as several days. Drinking extra fluids may help provide relief to the victim and help the gasoline pass through his system faster.


If the victim starts to feel worse at any point, take him to the doctor for further evaluation.

, Gasoline-stained clothing poses a fire hazard, and should be left outside to air dry for at least 24 hours, giving the fumes a chance to evaporate before being laundered. Wash the clothes separately from other clothing in hot water. Adding ammonia or baking soda to the wash may help remove the gasoline. Air dry the affected clothing to see if the gas smell is gone and repeat the washing process if needed.Do not put clothing that still smells like gasoline into a clothes dryer; it could combust!!

, The first priority is to make sure that the victim does not ingest any more gasoline. If the victim is unconscious, proceed directly to Step 3.

, If you suspect that your child has swallowed gasoline but don't know how much, treat this as an emergency situation and call Emergency Services immediately.

, Explain the situation in as much detail as you can. If the victim is a child, make it very clear that you require immediate assistance.

, If the victim is conscious, reassure him that help is on the way, and do not encourage vomiting. If the person seems able, offer him water to drink, and help him remove any gasoline-covered clothing and rinse any gasoline from his skin.


If person vomits, help him lean forward, or turn his head to the side to prevent choking and aspiration., Roll the victim onto his back, and begin chest compressions. For each compression, push down on the center of the victim's chest 2 inches (5.1 cm), or 1/3 to 1/2 the depth of the chest. Give 30 rapid compressions at a rate of about 100 per minute. Then tilt the victim's head back, and lift his chin. Pinch the victim's nose, and blow into his mouth until you see him chest rise. Give two breaths that each last about 1 second, and then another series of chest compressions.Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two breaths until the victim recovers or help arrives.
If you are on the phone with emergency services, the operator will coach you through the process of administering CPR.
The Red Cross now recommends that CPR should be administered to a child in the same way it is given to adults, with the exception that in an infant or small child, the compressions should only be 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) deep instead of 2 inches."

Know the symptoms of poisoning.,
Determine whether the victim is breathing.,
Call emergency services.,
Call Poison Help.,
Be ready with important information.,
Deal with ingested or swallowed poisons.,
Attend to poison in the eye(s).,
Cope with inhaled poisons.,
Handle poison on the skin.",How to Help a Person Who Has Ingested Poison," The signs of poisoning can depend on the type of poison that was ingested, such as whether it was pesticides, medications, or small batteries. Moreover, the general symptoms of poisoning often present similarly as those of other medical conditions, including seizures, insulin reactions, strokes, and intoxication. One of the best ways to know if poison has been ingested is in fact to look for clues like empty packages or bottles, stains or odors on the person or in a nearby spot, and items out of place or cupboards opened. That said, there are still some physical symptoms you should look out for, including:Burns and/or redness around the mouth area
Breath that smells of chemicals (gasoline or paint thinner)
Vomiting or regurgitating
Trouble breathing
Drowsiness or sleepiness
Mental confusion or other altered mental status;
, Look for a rise in the chest area; listen for the sound of air coming in and out of the lungs; feel for air by hovering the side of your face just above the person's mouth.If the person is not breathing or showing other signs of life, such as moving or coughing, administer CPR, and call emergency services or have someone else nearby call.If the victim is vomiting, especially if he is unconscious, turn his head to the side to prevent choking.

, Call 911 or your local emergency number if the person is unconscious and you suspect poisoning or if you suspect a medication, drug or alcohol overdose (or any combination of these). In addition, call 911 immediately if you note the person exhibiting the following severe symptoms of poisoning:Fainting
Difficulty breathing or cessation of breathing
Agitation or restless
Seizures

, If you are concerned that you have a potential poisoning case on your hands and the person remains stable and is not showing symptoms, call Poison Help at 1-800-222-1222 in the United States. If you know the number for your regional poison control center, then call it for assistance. Poison control centers are excellent resources for poisoning information and, in many situations, may advise that in-home observation and treatment (see Part 2) is all that's needed.Poison control center numbers for different areas may vary, but a simple web search should produce the appropriate number for your location. This is a free service that can prevent you from having to pay the costly fees associated with emergency rooms and doctor visits.
Poison control is open all day, every day. The poison control representative will walk you through the step-by-step process of treating someone who has swallowed poison. The representative may give you home treatment suggestions but may also tell you to immediately take the victim to the emergency room. Do exactly what you are told and nothing more; poison control representatives are highly skilled in assisting with ingested poisons.
You can also use the the website for Poison Control to get specific guidance on what you should do. However, only use this website if: the person is between the ages of 6 months and 79 years old, the person is asymptomatic and otherwise helpful, the person is not pregnant, the poison has been swallowed, the suspected poison is drugs, medicines, household products or berries, and the ingestion was unintentional and only occurred once.

, Be prepared to describe the person's age, weight, symptoms, additional medications he is taking, and any information available about what has been ingested to the medical authorities. You'll also need to give the person on the phone the address of where you are.Be sure as well to gather the labels or actual packaging (bottle, packet, etc.) or whatever was ingested. Try to give your best estimation of how much or many of the item was ingested.

, Have the person spit out anything remaining in his mouth and ensure that the poison is out of reach now. Do NOT make the person vomit and do NOT use any syrup of ipecac. Though this used to be standard practice, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Association of Poison Control Centers have changed their guidelines to warn against doing this and instead recommend notifying EMS or Poison Control and following their explicit instructions.If the person has swallowed a button-cell battery, then called EMS immediately for treatment in a hospital emergency room as soon as possible. The acid from the battery can burn your child's stomach within two hours so prompt treatment is essential., Gently flush out the affected eye with copious amounts of cool or lukewarm water for 15 minutes minutes or until medical assistance arrives. Try to pour a steady stream of water into the inner corner of the eye. This will help dilute the poison.Allow the person to blink and don't force the eye open as you pour the water in.

, When dealing with poisonous fumes or vapors, like carbon monoxide, for example, the best thing to do until help arrives is to get outside into the fresh air.Try to ascertain what chemical was inhaled so that you can tell Poison Control or Emergency Services in order to determine further treatment or other next steps.

, If you suspect that the person's skin came into contact with a poisonous or hazardous substance, remove any contaminated clothing with medical gloves such as nitrile, which are resistant to most household chemicals, or another fabric to cover your hands from being affected. Rinse the skin for 15 to 20 minutes with cool to lukewarm water in a shower or with a hose.Again, it's important to note what the source of the poison was in order to determine further treatment. For example, medical authorities need to know whether it was an alkali, acidic or other substance in order to assess the potential damage it can do to the skin and how to avoid or mediate that.

Apply ice for the first 48 hours.,
Treat with heat after 48 hours.,
Try over-the-counter medications.,
Elevate and rest the bruise.",How to Heal Bruises Fast1," A bruise is formed when a fall or blow causes blood vessels to break, causing blood flow to move to the skin's surface. When you first notice a bruise, apply ice right away. Ice can help heal a bruise fast by constricting underlying blood vessels.


An ice pack, a bag of frozen vegetables, or ice in a plastic bag can serve as a cold compress. Remember, do not place an ice pack directly on the skin. Always wrap an ice pack in a cloth or towel.Every hour, apply the cold compress for at least 20 minutes. Do this for the first 48 hours you notice a bruise.;
, After 48 hours, transition from a cold compress to a warm one. This can increase blood flow to the area, allowing the skin to heal quicker. You can make a warm compress by running warm water over a wash cloth. Apply the compress to the bruise for 10 minutes two to three times a day., Over-the-counter pain medications might help with the healing of a bruise. Most over-the-counter pain meds reduce swelling, which can make the bruise less noticeable.


Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) are your best options for a bruise. Take in the recommended dose at the recommended intervals.Before taking any over the counter meds, talk to your doctor or a pharmacist to make sure they won't interact with any existing medication you're taking., Elevate the bruise as much as possible during the first 24 hours. This is especially important if you have a large bruise on an area like your leg or foot. Try to get some rest as well, avoiding exerting the body part where the bruise occurred."

Use protective gear when engaging in exercise and sports.,
Keep floors and walkways clear.,
Assure you get adequate vitamin B12, vitamin C, and folic acid.,
Talk to your doctor about your medications.,
Wear a seat belt.",How to Heal Bruises Fast2," If you engage in vigorous exercise or sports, always wear protective gear. Invest in supplies like shoulder pads, knee pads, helmets, and other gear. If you're unsure what kind of equipment to buy, talk to a worker at a local sports or fitness shop., Bruises are often caused by accidental falls. Make sure you keep your floors and walkways clear of clutter to prevent bruising.


If you have young children, this can be difficult. Make sure to ask your kids to pick up after themselves and work on instilling good habits from an early. Explain to them the dangers associated with falling., The vitamins B12 and C, as well as folic acid, boosts your body's natural immune response to injury. Making sure your diet is high in these vitamins and minerals can prevent bruising and decrease healing time for existing bruises.B12 is found in many organ meats, like liver, as well as shellfish like clams. Eggs, milk, and dairy products are also rich in B12. If you're vegetarian or vegan, consider asking a doctor about taking B12 supplements.Many fruits contain vitamin C. Fruits like mango, pineapple, strawberries, papaya, citrus fruits, and cantaloupe are particularly high in vitamin C. Veggies high in vitamin C include broccoli, spinach, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, and winter squash.Folic acid is found in citrus fruits, dark green vegetables, and legumes like peas and dried beans., Certain medications, such as blood thinners, can cause you to bruise more easily. Anticoagulants such as lovenox, warfarin, aspirin, and heparin can thin the blood and lead to increased bruising. Other medication such as NSAIDS, corticosteroids, and even supplements like fish oil and vitamin E may cause you to bruise easily. Your doctor may be able to switch you to a different medication if you are concerned about bruising.

Bruising easily may also be a sign of an underlying health problem, such as liver disease or a vitamin K deficiency related to celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and alcohol abuse. Talk to your doctor if you seem to bruise at the smallest bump or often have bruises and you don't know where they came from, if you have a hematoma (lump) over the bruise, pain three days after a minor injury, if you have a family history of bruising or bleeding easily, or if you suddenly begin bruising easily when you did not before., Always wear a seat belt when driving. Not only does this prevent driving-related bruising, seat belts keep you safe from potentially fatal injuries in the event of a car crash."

See a doctor.",How to Identify and Treat Injuries From Stingrays and Sea Urchins," Stingray injuries can be accompanied by symptoms (some mild, some serious) such as those listed below:There is a puncture wound. The hole from the stinger (barb) can be quite large and may have a jagged appearance. The stingray rarely leaves the barb behind, but on rare occasions it may break off in the wound.
The victim experiences immediate and severe pain radiating from the puncture site.
The wounded area swells significantly.
The puncture site bleeds.
Skin color around the wound initially appears blue, then changes to red.
The victim sweats abnormally.
The victim becomes faint, weak, or dizzy.
The victim develops a headache.
The victim experiences nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
The victim experiences shortness of breath.
The victim has a seizure or experiences muscle cramping or paralysis.;
, The following are strong indications that medical assistance is immediately required:The injury is located in the victim's abdomen, chest, neck, or face.
The victim bleeds profusely.
The victim experiences difficulty breathing, itching, nausea, tightness in the throat, rapid pulse, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.

, Lay the victim down on the ground if the incident occurs near shore, or on the floor or seat of a boat if the incident occurs in open water with a vessel nearby.Getting out of the water quickly and safely is essential to prevent further injury.
If the victim is vomiting, turn him on his side to prevent choking., This is best done by applying pressure to the puncture site with a clean cloth or towel. If no clean cloth or towel is available, a shirt or other piece of clothing can be used.
Only apply as much pressure as is needed to stop or significantly slow the loss of blood. If the victim is conscious, ask her whether the pressure is tolerable or if it is causing significantly more pain.

, If the stingray barb is still present in the wound, removing it will stop additional toxins from being released into the wound.However, the barb is serrated and will slice the skin as it is extracted, which releases more venom into the wound. In addition, attempted removal by someone other than a trained medical professional may cause the barb to break in the wound, meaning a doctor will need to go into the wound again to remove the broken pieces left behind. A very large barb may actually be blocking a wound and preventing severe bleeding. For these reasons, you should only attempt to remove the barb if there is no chance of prompt medical care, such as if you are very far out at sea.


If no tweezers are available, needle-nosed pliers can be used to remove the barb. If possible, choose a tool that is relatively clean so as not to introduce potentially infectious agents to the victim's wound.
Be careful not to sting yourself or anyone else with the barb once it is removed from the victim's wound. Dispose of the barb by placing it in an empty bottle and replacing the cap or wrapping it in several plastic bags. This prevents anyone else from accidentally coming into contact with it.
Do not use your bare hands to remove the barb from the victim's wound. If no implements are available for removal of the barb, it is best to wait until medical professionals can do this. Even thick gloves cannot eliminate your risk of being pricked by the barb during removal, so extreme caution is advised.

, This should be done by cleaning it with warm, fresh water and soap and/or antiseptic wash. Cold water can be used if no warm water is available, but this will be more painful for the victim. If the victim is in extreme pain, it may not be possible to perform this step.If no clean water or antiseptic wash is available, it is best to leave the wound alone until it can be washed. Using dirty water could do more harm than good by increasing the victim's risk of infection. This could be especially dangerous if the wound is deep.

, This should be done once the victim is at home or at a medical facility. Use very warm or hot water and allow the body part to soak for 30 to 90 minutes. Be sure to use a clean vessel and clean, fresh water for soaking the injured body part. This will help prevent further risk of infection.
Warm water can denature the proteins in the venom. Try to use water as hot as 113°F (45°C).

, This will promote healing and prevent infection. Unless otherwise instructed by a medical professional, wash the injured area at least once a day and apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment to the wound.


A commonly used antibiotic ointment readily available in the U.S. is Neosporin triple-antibiotic. Numerous generic versions of this also exist in pharmacies and convenience stores. These ointments are for topical use only.

, These over-the-counter drugs (those available without a doctor's prescription) serve to reduce swelling and pain. Skip this step if the victim is vomiting or allergic to such medication.Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications are those that contain ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen; they are available in a variety of brand options (such as Advil, Motrin, and Aleve) and can be found at any pharmacy in the U.S. and most other countries.
Note that anti-inflammatory medications will not speed the healing process; they simply provide relief from pain and discomfort.
Remember that stingray venom in particular is thought to have anti-coagulation effects, especially in large doses. If the wound site is bleeding and will not seem to slow, or if the sting was particularly severe, refrain from giving these drugs as they can further decrease clotting. Instead, go to a hospital for treatment right away, where they can administer local painkiller injections and topical anesthetics.

, Even if the wound is not severe and pain subsides quickly, the victim should obtain medical treatment. It is always easiest to treat wounds such as these early to prevent complications down the road and to eliminate certain risks.A doctor may order medical imaging tests to ensure that no barb fragments remain in the wound. This is the only way to ensure that no harmful objects remain in the victim's body. Even a small barb fragment can cause an infection.
In order to prevent infection (especially from wounds occurring in salt water bodies), antibiotics may be prescribed. Always follow a prescribed course of antibiotics to completion, even if you believe the wound has healed. Failure to do so could invite infection or make one worse.
Pain medication may be prescribed if over-the-counter medication is inadequate. Never take more than the recommended dose of a prescribed pain medication. For your safety, strictly adhere to any accompanying instructions (such as things not to eat or drink while taking the medication).

, A strong clue that the victim's injury came from a sea urchin sting is the visual identification of a sea urchin in the immediate area. These creatures cannot quickly flee; if a person is stung by a sea urchin it can usually be easily spotted for confirmation.


This is not critical to the victim's safety or well being, but simply allows you to be reasonably sure that a sea urchin was the cause of the injury.

, Sea urchin injuries can vary widely in terms of severity, but commonly cause symptoms such as those listed below.The site of injury contains spine fragments (barbs) embedded in the skin. These barbs will often have a bluish tinge that shows under the skin, revealing the site of even small stingers
The victim experiences immediate and severe pain at the injury site.
The puncture site is swollen.
The skin around the wound is red or brownish-purple in color.
The victim experiences joint discomfort or muscle pain.
The victim becomes weak or fatigued.

, Even a small or apparently minor injury from a sea urchin sting can be life-threatening, especially if the victim is allergic to the urchin's venom. The following are strong indications that urgent medical treatment is required:There are multiple, deep puncture wounds.
The injury is located in the victim's abdomen, chest, neck, or face.
The victim experiences fatigue, muscle aches, weakness, shock, paralysis, or respiratory failure.

, Lay the victim down on the ground if the incident occurs near shore. Most sea urchin stings occur as a result of accidentally stepping on an urchin with bare feet. As such, most sea urchin injuries occur in shallow water near a shore or beach.


Just as for any other sea creature-induced injury, getting out of the water quickly and safely is essential to prevent further injury.
Elevate the injured body part to avoid getting sand or dirt in the wound, especially if the injury is to the bottom of the victim's foot.

, If the victim and/or his companions determine that emergency services are not required, someone will need to transport him to his home, a hospital, a hotel, or some other nearby location for further treatment of the wound.


Do not allow the victim to drive himself, as additional symptoms could set in after the initial injury and cause him to lose consciousness or experience more severe pain.
If no transportation is available or nobody knows where to find a hospital or hotel, call emergency services (in the U.S., dial 9-1-1). It is not safe to delay treatment of the victim's wound.

, This will neutralize the venom and reduce pain, and softens the skin for easier barb removal.Use a clean vessel and clean, fresh water for soaking the injured body part. This will help prevent further risk of infection.
Soaking the wound will not promote healing, but should offer some pain relief and facilitate barb/spine removal.
Do not dry the affected area. Proceed with barb removal while the skin is still wet and soft.
You can also soak the wound in vinegar, which may neutralize the venom and soothe the wound.

, Doing so will stop additional toxins from being released into the wound and should ease the victim's pain.Needle-nosed pliers or a similar device can be used to remove large barbs from the wound if no tweezers are available. Choose a tool that is clean (even better, sterilized) so as not to introduce potentially infectious agents to the victim's wound.
Dispose of barbs in an empty bottle and seal it, or wrap it in many plastic bags before putting it in a waste receptacle.
Do not use your bare hands to remove the barb from the victim's wound. If no implements are available for removal of the barb, it is best to seek medical assistance.

, Apply shaving cream to the affected area and gently scrape off superficial spines on the skin with a shaving razor. Even these tiny spines can release venom into the skin and may cause a great deal of pain if not removed.Don't use menthol shaving cream, as this has a cooling effect on the skin and could cause more pain or irritate the wound.
You can soak the affected body part in vinegar prior to shaving off the spines. This will help dissolve smaller spines and facilitates more thorough removal of the venomous agent., This will help clean the wound and remove any remaining superficial spines. Flush the affected area thoroughly with warm, fresh water after washing. Cold water may be used, but will likely cause the victim more pain; warm water has a neutralizing effect.
Antiseptic wash may be used in lieu of soap, but is usually not necessary.

, This will reduce swelling and pain. Skip this step if the victim is vomiting or allergic to such medication.Note that anti-inflammatory medications will not speed the healing process. These are over-the-counter drugs that simply provide relief from pain and discomfort.
Never exceed the recommended dosage for the victim's age and body weight. Even over-the-counter medications can be harmful if abused.

, Even if the wound is not severe and pain subsides quickly, the victim should obtain medical treatment to heal properly and circumvent a range of potential complications.Medical imaging tests may be recommended by a doctor to ensure that no barb fragments remain in the wound. Urchin barb fragments tend to work their way further into the skin as time goes on and can often impact nerves or surrounding tissues and be a considerable source of complications.
Swelling and pain persisting longer than five days may indicate infection or the presence of deep barb fragments. Only doctors are equipped to deal with this issue and can prescribe antibiotic medications for battling infections. Always follow a prescribed course of antibiotics to completion, even if you believe the wound has healed.
Rarely, minor surgery may be required to remove deep barb fragments.
Pain medication may be prescribed if pain is severe or in cases where surgery is required.

Call 911 or an ambulance right away.,
Look for symptoms.,
Stay close to them, and always keep an eye on them.,
Make sure they do not eat or drink.,
Know what to do if the person is having a seizure.,
Do not give them a ""shower"".,
Get information on what substance the person might have taken.,
Get medical help.,
Always check up on the individual.",How to Help Someone That Has Overdosed," Do not wait for the drug to wear off; call for help right away. A drug overdose can be fatal or cause permanent damage to a person's organs.;
, There are many symptoms of drug overdose, which include:


Change in body temperature (sweating or overheating; shivering or drop in body temperature)
Heart rate changing drastically
Chest pains
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Difficulty breathing
Abdominal cramps
Dizziness
Seizures
Snoring deeply
Skin turning pale

, Someone who has overdosed can go in and out of consciousness. Try to keep the patient awake., If you do not know what they have taken, or even if you do, it may not be safe to put other chemicals in the body, as this can have a negative or even dangerous reaction., In some cases, an overdose can cause a person to have a seizure, which can be doubly scary if you've never dealt with either situation before. However, the steps for dealing with someone's seizure are actually fairly simple in nature.


Lower the person to the floor.
Make sure the person is still breathing.
Stay with the person. Especially since this person has just overdosed, do not leave them alone.

, A common suggestion for those who have overdosed on drugs or are suffering from alcohol poisoning is to get the person into a shower and turn on the cold water, dousing them. Avoid doing this in any situation. The water temperature might put the body in shock and cause the person's body temperature to drop into dangerous levels - and it's pretty tough to drag a person in and out of a shower if they're incapacitated., If the person is conscious and able to communicate, try to get information on what they overdosed on. This will help the doctors or paramedics to give the appropriate treatment without wasting any time.

, After the overdose, the person who overdosed should get immediate medical attention. This will help others to understand if the overdose was intentional or accidental, which, in turn, helps the person and medical figures figure out if they need psychiatric help.

, Get them the proper help. Give them the right contacts such as a rehab or addiction hotline.

Rest and immobilize the injured part.,
Apply a cold compress on early onset of injury.,
Apply a warm compress during the recovery phase of the injury (after 24-48 hours).,
Do vasodilating activities after early onset of injury.,
Elevate the site of injury.,
Take pain medication.,
Eat more protein.,
Get enough vitamin B12.,
Get sufficient vitamin K. Vitamin K (K1 - phylloquinone and K2 menaquinone) deficiency may occur as a result of inadequate fat absorption and/or antibiotic consumption.,
Get more vitamin C, too.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Use turmeric.,
Know what type of hematoma you have.,
Know the possible symptoms.,
Know the risk factors.,
Know that surgery is an option.",How to Heal a Hematoma at Home," Muscle activity and movement can irritate and increase the pressure on the soft tissues which can trigger an inflammatory response. Maintain relative rest for the first 48 hours if at all possible.


Immobilization that keeps you in a normal anatomical position (lying on your back with the palms and feet pointing forward) is helpful in the healing process and may prevent further damage. This is especially true for the extremities and joint areas.;
, This should be done within 24-48 hours after injury. Apply an ice pack to the affected area immediately after you notice a hematoma starts to develop. Low temperature reduces blood flow, decreasing bleeding. Remember not to hold the ice pack on the skin for more that 15-20 minutes to prevent tissue damage.


Use melting ice on a wet towel (18-27°C/64-80°F) to be applied to the site of injury for 10 minutes at a time. Repeat as necessary (4-8 times a day) to reduce the local skin temperature by 10-15°C.
The cold temperature causes vasoconstriction (constriction of the blood vessels) and limits post injury swelling and accumulation of blood underneath the skin. On early onset of injury, vasoconstriction aids in limiting the leaking-out of blood in the blood vessels and decreases the area needed to clot.
This also decreases local tissue metabolism which lessens the likelihood of “hypoxia” – cell injury due to decrease oxygen delivery.

, This should be 37-40 °C (98-104°F). In contrast with the cold compress, warm compress are more beneficial in the recovery state because they dilate the blood vessels improving the circulation and delivery of nutrients necessary for repair.


The increased perfusion also washes out any inflammatory exudates and waste products from the injury. Furthermore, the warm sensation diminishes the pain by acting as a counter irritant that masks the pain brought about by the injury.
Reminder: warm compress should not be applied in the early onset of injury – vasodilation will do more harm. The same is true for massaging the site of injury and alcohol intake (both causing vasodilation and increased blood flow).

, Again, this is 24-48 hours after injury. Here's what you can do to heal the hematoma:



Massaging. This is done in circular motion or long strokes to improve circulation and increase venous return. It may also directly help to breakdown superficial clots making them easier for the body to dissolve. Refrain if pain is present.

Take a warm bath. A relaxing warm batch will also illicit a vasodilator effect similar to a warm compress which helps not only with sensations of pain but on taking out the blood clots from the affected area – all due to increased blood flow.

Isotonic exercises. This is basically contracting both muscles (flexors and extensors) in an area without producing gross movement. These types of contractions increases blood return by rhythmically compressing the blood vessels which subsequently increases blood flow.

, This is especially helpful for extremities. Keeping the area in which the hematoma has occurred on an elevated surface will reduce blood flow to that specific area, preventing the increase of the hematoma’s dimensions. Use pillows or blankets to keep the area elevated.


Keep the injured area as much as possible above the level of the heart. This decreases the local capillary pressure, prevents swelling, assists in lymphatic drainage, assists in dispersal of exudates, and reduces tissue pressure. This may help with local pain and ultimately promote healing.

, If you do not suffer from any other disease or aren’t under an anticoagulation treatment, you can use pretty much any painkiller. Ibuprofen is often the weapon of choice for a lot of people. However, you may wish to talk to a doctor to get his opinion on what's best for you.


You can administer the drugs orally, in a 200 to 400 milligram dose.Ibuprofen should be administered as needed every 4 to 6 hours.

, This may provide needed benefits for tissue repair. High levels of protein usually come from animal sources rather than plant sources. Here are some examples of proteins arranged highest to lowest based on biologic value (proteins that are more easily absorbed by your body):


Whey protein isolate – highest pH (alkaline), Non-denatured
Tuna sashimi
Wild salmon
Halibut
Poached egg
Turkey breast
Venison
Cottage cheese
Sardines
Chicken breast
Leg of lamb
Soy protein
Pork ribs
Fried eggs
Ground beef
Hot dogs

, A vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) deficiency can also cause easy bruising, pernicious anemia, and poor blood clotting. This is especially true for vegetarians — plant food sources have no vitamin B12 unless they are fortified. If you're vegan or vegetarian, it may be wise to take a supplement.


This is found naturally in a wide variety of animal foods including organ meats (beef liver), shellfish (clams), meat, poultry, eggs, milk and other dairy foods, some breakfast cereals and nutritional yeasts.

, Impaired blood clotting and hemorrhagic diseases are associated with deficiency of Vitamin K.


Sources of dietary vitamin K includes green tea, leafy greens s(uch as Swiss chard, kale, parsley and spinach), broccoli and cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, liver, soybean oil and wheat bran.
Fermented dairy, including yogurt, cheeses, and fermented soy including miso and natto, provides Menaquinone.
The recommended daily adequate intake of vitamin K is 120 mcg for adult males and 90 mcg for adult females., Additional intake of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) daily (500 mg) may help with the formation of new connective tissues maintenance and repair, especially for the walls of blood vessels.


Great sources of vitamin C are papaya, bell peppers, broccoli, strawberries, pineapple, cauliflower and oranges.As a rule, regular intake of a wide variety of food are more than enough to meet nutritional demands for both macro and micronutrients – supplements are only prescribed in special circumstances like malnutrition and pregnancy.

, Maintaining hydration and increasing fluid intake also has its benefits. Be sure to drink whenever you feel thirsty, or at least 1.5- 2L per day (highly variable with body size). The more you drink, the more toxins will be flushed out of your system -- and the more you'll see it in your waistline, hair, skin, and nails, too.


Water is better than any other liquid you can drink. Unsweetened fruit juices and decaffeinated teas are okay and can be consumed safely in moderation, but the focus should be water.

, Turmeric has anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties and will prevent any further inflammation or infection of the affected site. It contains essential oils which can increase blood flow and the number of red blood cells. The hematoma can then be absorbed a lot easier.


Dissolve a teaspoon of turmeric powder in a glass of milk and drink the mix once a day. Alternatively, use it as a spice in your dishes you cook at home. Use the remedy until the hematoma disappears.
Turmeric is widely known to have medicinal properties, but there is no specific science to back it up. If you do use this remedy, be sure to supplement it with others., The term hematoma refers to a restricted blood collection found outside the blood vessels. It is usually found in liquid form, inside the tissue. If a hematoma exceeds 10 millimeters in diameter, it is referred to as an ecchymosis.There are numerous types of hematoma, depending on the area in which it occurs. The most common types include:


Subdermal hematoma, found just beneath the skin.
Cephalohematoma, a form of hematoma which occurs between the skull and the periosteum (the membrane covering the outside of the bones).
Epidural hematoma is a form of hematoma occurring between the dura mater (one of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord).
Subdural hematomas occur between the arachnoid mater (the second membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord) and the dura mater.
Subarachnoid hematoma occur between the pia mater (the innermost membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord) and arachnoid mater.
Perianal hematoma is a type of hematoma found on the border of the anus or inside it.
Subungual hematoma is a frequent type of hematoma, which can be found underneath a nail.

, Hematoma symptoms depend on its location and size. Here are the symptoms that often accompany your average hematoma:Pain. Pain is one of the most common symptoms of a hematoma. It occurs because the tissue where the hematoma occurs is inflamed.

Swelling. If a tissue becomes flooded with blood, it will become inflamed, and will eventually swell.

Redness. Redness of the area where a hematoma is formed is caused by the blood building up underneath the surface of the skin (subdermal hematoma), and because of inflammation.

Headache and confusion. In the case of a subdural hematoma, the blood will cause pressure and inflammation of the surrounding tissues, causing headache. Confusion will also occur, because the hematoma will start to compress the nerves inside your head.

A lucid period followed by unconsciousness. The lucid period is experienced right after the blood starts to collect. As the blood continues to flow, you may lose consciousness.

Weakness of the extremities. Again, this is a symptom experienced in severe, cranial hematomas. The blood collection will compress the crossed pyramid pathways (tracts of the nervous system) causing weakness in the extremities

, One of the main causes of certain types of hematoma is trauma. When practicing a contact sport, such as martial arts, boxing or rugby, you will suffer trauma to different parts of your body. However, there are other causes, too:



Blood clotting condition. When suffering from conditions like diabetes or hemophilia, you are at risk of developing numerous hematomas, because the blood doesn’t properly clot, or in some cases, doesn’t clot at all.

Work environment. Working in a place where the risk of trauma is high, like a construction site, for example, will make you prone to hematoma. The most common types of work related hematomas are subdermal hematoma and subungual hematoma.

Age. Elderly people or very young children are at risk of developing hematomas (especially subdural) because their blood vessel structure is weak.

Alcohol abuse. A long period of chronic alcohol consumption will make you prone to developing a hematoma. Alcohol induces vasodilatation (the widening of blood vessels) making the blood vessels prone to damage.

Abnormal labor and birth. If you are a woman giving birth via vertex or vacuum delivery, the newborn is at risk of suffering cephalohematoma. A prolonged second stage of labor can also cause this type of hematoma as well.

, Certain hematomas require surgical intervention and drainage. A subdural hematoma with obvious symptoms will require immediate surgery. In this case, the procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Talk to your doctor about the right treatment for you.


A neurosurgeon will perform a craniotomy (surgical opening of the skull) followed by the opening of the dura mater. The hematoma will be removed by irrigation or suction. The bleeding sites will be identified, and the bleeding will be stopped."

If you do not have a bandage wrap, any strip of fabric, such as cotton or T-shirt material, will do.;
, Place the end of the bandage on the ball of your foot, and roll the bandage over the top of your foot. Keep rolling the bandage around your foot and ankle, leaving the heel exposed, until you reach your lower-calf. Be sure you have enough bandage left over to wrap around an icepack.Do not wrap your ankle too tightly, or else you might cut off blood circulation. If your toes are turning blue or purple, or if you feel any numbness, you might be wrapping the bandage too tightly.

, Roll the bandage back over the icepack, covering it, cut off the extra, and secure it.


If you do not have an icepack, you can make your own by putting ice into a plastic bag and sealing it.
If you are using an elastic bandage, you may notice that some metal hooks or latches have been included in the packaging. Use these to secure the bandage so that it does not unwrap.

Choose the right style brace.,
Pull the brace on over your leg.,
Center the brace on your kneecap.,
Tighten the straps.,
Put the brace on under other clothes.,
Wear shorts.,
Remove the brace periodically.,
Follow the doctor’s orders.,
Keep your weight off your bad knee.,
Restrict your range of motion.,
Wear the brace during any type of physical activity.",How to Wear a Knee Brace," The type of brace you end up with will depend on how severe your injury is. If you only have a mild sprain, you may able to get away with a simple compression sleeve. For more serious tears or fractures, you’ll probably need a heavier-duty hinged brace reinforced with plastic or metal.Your healthcare provider will usually supply you with a brace that’s best suited for your injury.
It will also be important to find a brace in a size that fits you. Sizes are usually displayed on the backside of the packaging, and commercial models may be available in standard sizes.;
, Start by rolling up your pant leg to get it out of the way. Slip your foot into the top of the brace (the area where it widens to accommodate your thigh) and out through the bottom. Slide the brace up your leg until it rests over your injured knee.


If the brace you’re using is a wrap style as opposed to a sleeve style, place the inside of the pad against your knee, then wind the straps around., Most braces have a small hole in the front to indicate which way they should go on. When worn correctly, the point of your kneecap should be visible through this hole. This will offer greater comfort and keep the skin beneath the brace ventilated.Align the brace so that the hole doesn’t pinch or catch your skin.
Make sure the brace won’t slide up or down before you secure it.

, For compression sleeves, you’re done once you’ve got the brace on properly situated. If there are additional straps, guide these around the back of the brace and secure them in front using the Velcro strips. Your brace should be snug, but not too tight.You should be able to fit one or two fingers into the space between the brace and your leg. If you can’t, the brace probably needs to be relaxed a bit.
Fastening the lower strap first will steady the brace and help you achieve a more stable fit., When it’s cold outside or you’re in a place with a strict dress code, like school or work, it may be necessary to keep your brace covered up. Pick out loose-fitting garments like jeans or sweatpants that the brace will fit underneath easily. This will also keep the outline from being quite as visible.Always strap on the brace first, followed by your clothes. It will work better the closer it is to the limb itself.
Athletic style clothing tends to be baggy and offer a little stretch, which may be easier to manage than fitted pants.

, Most people will find that it’s easiest to get the brace on and off with no extra material to get in the way. Shorts will provide immediate access to your injured leg while promoting airflow so you don’t get too hot and stuffy.


Shorts are perfect for accommodating longer types of braces (like hinged functional braces) which sit higher up on the leg.

, This will relieve the pressure around your knee and give your skin a chance to breathe. Be careful not to put too much weight on your injured leg while you’re not wearing the brace. It will probably be best to remain sitting or lying down.


You should remove your brace before showering or swimming to keep it from getting wet.Make sure to speak to your doctor about whether it’s okay to go unsupported, and for how long.

, Always listen to and trust your physician when it comes to dealing with debilitating injuries. They’ll be able to tell you all the important details you need to know, like the best way to wear the brace, how long you’ll need it and what types of movements to avoid.It may be that you’ll only need to wear your knee brace for part of the day or during certain types of activities. More serious injuries may require you to wear the brace at all times.Don’t hesitate to ask your doctor any questions you have about your injury or the rehabilitation process.

, Tread lightly when you walk to prevent placing unnecessary strain on the joint. When standing, try not to lean or shift your weight over your bad leg. Until your knee is strong enough to support your full weight, it will be unstable and vulnerable to changes in pressure.If the injury is bad enough, you may also need crutches to walk for the first few days or weeks.
Limping is normal and even helpful, since it limits the amount of time you spend on one leg.

, Knee braces are meant to keep you from bending your injured leg too much. Even so, be careful about how much movement you put your knee through while wearing your brace. Flexing or rotating the joint too much may make the injury worse.For the most part, you’ll want to keep your knee straight, relaxed and elevated while you’re trying to healing.
Avoid any movement that places the joint in a painful position.

, Assuming your doctor has said it’s okay, you may be able to resume exercising or playing sports once your knee has begun healing. It will still be important to wear your brace correctly while active. Keep intense actions to a minimum, and avoid load-bearing exercise like weight lifting, unless otherwise instructed.Don’t push yourself too hard. If you experience any unusual pain or discomfort, stop what you’re doing immediately.A brace might also come in handy for preventing injuries in sports that frequently put the knee in vulnerable or unstable positions, such as football, soccer, hockey or gymnastics."

Full name and date of birth are the two most common identifiers. For prescriptions fulfilled outside of a hospital, the patient's phone number and/or current home address will usually be included, as well.
One identifier isn't enough, even if you use the patient's full name. If two patients share the same name, it would be impossible to know which one the prescription refers to without any other identifier.;
, As the prescriber, your name and contact information must also be listed on the prescription. Include your full name, the address of your medical practice, and the phone number of your medical practice.


Note that your United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) number must also be included somewhere on the prescription.
In most cases, this information will already be printed on the prescription form. If it isn't, however, you will need to write it manually.

, Some prescriptions must be filled within a certain time period. Even when the medication being prescribed does not fall into that category, you should still include the date.


Time-sensitive drugs are rated based on schedule categories.Schedule I drugs have a high potential for abuse and have no legally accepted medical use within the United States.
Schedule II drugs have a high potential for abuse but do have some legally accepted medical use.
Schedule III drugs have some potential for abuse and can be used for some medical purposes.
Schedule IV drugs have a relatively low potential for abuse and are legally permitted for some medical purposes.
Schedule V drugs have even lower potential for abuse and are legally permitted for certain medical purposes.



, You will need to sign each prescription before it can be considered valid. Your signature will usually go at the bottom of the form, regardless of whether or not there is a specific line for it there.


It is strongly recommended that you write out the rest of the prescription and sign your name last. Doing so prevents unfinished or blank prescriptions from falling into the wrong hands.

, ""Rx"" is the symbol for ""superscription."" Write it just before you write out your instructions for the medication itself.


On most prescription forms, the ""Rx"" is already printed.
Write the inscription information immediately after this symbol. The inscription includes all of the information about the specific drug you want to prescribe.

, You should typically use the generic, non-proprietary name of the drug instead of the name brand.Use the name brand of the drug only when you specifically wish to prescribe the name brand. Keep in mind that doing so may make the prescription more expensive for the patient.
If you want to prescribe the name brand, you should also include a note on the prescription reading ""No Generics."" On most prescription forms, there will be a ""Brand Name Only"" or ""No Generics"" box you have the option of checking for this purpose.

, Most medications come in multiple strengths, so you must mention the strength you wish to prescribe immediately after the name of the medication.


The strength amount should be indicated in milligrams for tablets and suppositories and milliliters for fluids.
Write words instead of abbreviations to avoid possible misunderstandings.

, Tell the pharmacist exactly how much of the medication should be filled and passed to the patient.


This information should usually be preceded by an appropriate heading, such as ""dispense,"" ""disp,"" ""#,"" or ""how much.""
Include the specific bottle size or number of tablets/capsules. Spell the numbers out to avoid possible miscommunication.

, For medications that treat a chronic condition or other similar reasons, you may wish to permit a certain number of refills before another prescription will be required. Only allow additional refills when the patient will need the exact same prescription multiple times.
For example, you might wish to prescribe a year's worth of oral contraceptives, yet each fulfillment of the prescription might only provide a month's worth. On the prescription form, write ""Refills 11"" to indicate that eleven refills are permitted after the first fulfillment. After the final refill runs out, the patient will need a new prescription before any additional medication can be obtained.
If you do not wish to permit any refills, write ""Refills 0"" or ""Refills none"" to indicate as much. Doing so reduces the risk of possible tampering.

, The route is the method used to take the medication prescribed. When writing the route, you can mention the instructions using either the accepted English term or the corresponding Latin abbreviation.


Common options include:By mouth (PO)
Per rectum (PR)
Intramuscular (IM)
Intravenous (IV)
Intradermal (ID)
Intranasal (IN)
Topical (TP)
Sublingual (SL)
Buccal (BUCC)
Intraperitoneal (IP)



, State how much of the medication the patient should use each time he or she takes it. These instructions will be transferred to the prescription label once it is fulfilled.


For instance, you might write something like ""one 30 milligram tablet"" or ""30 milliliters.

, The frequency describes when and how often the medication should be taken. It is strongly recommended that you write out the frequency in full rather than using abbreviations.


In fact, a medication that must be used ""daily"" or ""every other day"" must be written out in full. Abbreviations for these frequencies are prohibited.
Other frequency abbreviations can be used, but it is still recommended that you spell out the instructions instead of using the abbreviated form. Several common options include:

Twice a day (BID)
Three times a day (TID)
Four times a day (QID)
Every bedtime (QHS)
Every four hours (Q4H)
Every four to six hours (Q4-6H)
Every week (QWK)



, Most medications must be taken until the drug runs out. In some cases, however, the patient should stop taking the medication once his or her symptoms disappear. You should specifically write which is the case on the prescription form.

, When a medication should only be used on an ""as needed"" basis, you should include a brief diagnosis or reason for taking the medication.


Specify this diagnosis with the abbreviation ""PRN."" For example, the statement for a pain medication might read ""PRN pain.""

, Occasionally, there might be a special instruction that needs to go on the label. Let the pharmacist know to include it by specifically writing the instruction on the prescription form.


A few common examples include:

""Take with food""
""Avoid alcohol""
""Keep refrigerated""
""Do not freeze""
""For external use only""
""Shake before instillation""

You should always ask the patient for their preference and take this into account providing that he/she is not unconscious, delirious, or in shock (in these cases, an ambulance should be called immediately). Here are a few common reasons for going to the hospital without an ambulance:


The patient is going into labor. Labor generally takes a long time, and most deliveries are not life-threatening to the mother or baby. For these reasons, it is usually okay to transport a woman in labor to the hospital in a personal vehicle.The patient is bleeding severely. In this situation, the patient's life may be in immediate danger. Transportation to the emergency room without an ambulance should only be performed in this case if treatment can be obtained more quickly by driving the patient yourself. In either case, applying pressure to the wound or creating a tourniquet for the injured body part to stop or slow bleeding may be of immediate concern.The patient has been bitten by a venomous animal. Many animal venoms causes tissue and central nervous system damage.The more quickly an antivenin is administered, the more effective it will be. By transporting the victim yourself, you may be able to obtain treatment for the patient more quickly than by waiting for an ambulance.
In the case of severe bleeding or a venomous animal bite, be sure you have someone call 911, alert the hospital and EMS that you are en route and the nature of the injury. Give the route you will be taking so that EMS and police can be there if you have to pull over or there are other complications.;
, If you decide to transport the patient to the hospital yourself, call (or have someone else call) EMS to report the situation and have the operator connect you to the hospital to which you are headed (or relay the information for you). This will inform hospital staff of the patient's condition and will allow them to prepare for the patient's arrival to begin administering treatment as soon as possible.


Be calm and collect yourself before you call.
Be clear to the operator that you are transporting the patient yourself and that EMS are not needed at the site of the incident. You don't want to have an ambulance dispatched if it is not needed, as this is an unnecessary use of resources and could keep paramedics from helping someone else in need.
Explain the situation to the operator. This person is likely someone with training and significant experience in emergency situations, and he or she might be able to provide critical information or guidance (such as first-aid techniques or fastest routes to the hospital) to you during patient transportation.
Have as much information as possible available for hospital staff when the call is made. The more they know about the situation and the person in need of care, the more quickly and effectively treatment may be provided.
If you relay through a third party, make sure he knows the route you will be taking; consider having him take a moment to write down the information you need to tell the operator.

, If the situation is urgent but the patient's life is not immediately threatened, it may be worthwhile to take a minute or two before departing to figure out which route to the emergency room is quickest and free of congestion or obstructions.


Make sure you're aware of the emergency room nearest to your location. If you are unfamiliar with the area, ask someone who knows, such as a bystander or neighbor. Ask also if that person would be willing to accompany you to help navigate effectively.
Use digital maps that contain live updates on traffic conditions, accidents, and the like. A GPS-enabled smartphone with a navigation program is the easiest and fastest way to obtain this information and will automatically determine the fastest route for you.
If possible, avoid traffic delay areas such as construction zones and streets with lots of stop lights. Keep in mind that freeways, although free of stop lights and with higher speed limits, can become gridlocked and offer relatively few outlets for reroutes.

, In certain situations— when controversial medical procedures may be necessary, for example — having important items or information about the patient can speed things up:Patient identification, such as a driver's license or passport.
Insurance information/card.
Allergy information, as people occasionally keep on bracelets or in document form.
Medication information (if the patient is taking any).
Anything the patient may need on the drive, such as water, a blanket, or spare bandages.
A living will.
Consider bringing a family member, friend/bystander or current caregiver for the patient if you yourself cannot provide information on the situation. This person can also help tend the patient while you drive.

, If you have options, select a vehicle for transportation that will be most comfortable and effective for transporting the patient. Your first priority should be reliability, as the last thing you want is to break down en route to the hospital. Here are a few other factors to consider:


Larger vehicles like vans and SUVs (especially those with four or more doors) will allow loading and unloading of the patient more easily than more compact vehicles.
Make sure the vehicle has sufficient fuel for the trip. A dependable, large car is not going to be of much use if it runs out of gas before you get to the emergency room. If necessary, consider making a brief stop for fuel. However, keep in mind that the longer you take to complete tasks like this, the better off the patient may be taking an ambulance.
Consider the weather and/or road conditions. Don't choose a sports car if there is a foot of snow on the road just because it had its battery replaced most recently.

, It may be useful to have a third person in the vehicle during transportation of the patient so that one person can tend to him or her while the other drives. If you do not have a third companion with you, ask a neighbor or bystander if they would be willing to accompany you on the drive.


This step will be more important for some situations than others. For instance, someone losing lots of blood would benefit from a third person in the car to apply pressure to their wound, whereas a woman in labor may not need someone other than a driver.
It is best to rely on someone you trust to fill this role if possible. This way, you can avoid any unpleasant surprises that might come with sharing a car ride with a stranger. For example, it turns out that that stranger is the driver's ex boyfriend of nine years ago. It would certainly make for an awkward car ride.

, Avoiding distractions if at all possible will help guarantee that the vehicle's occupants are spared unnecessary risk.This advice applies to driving in any circumstance, but is especially pertinent to emergency patient transport because of the likely hectic nature of the situation.


Using voice directions from a GPS-enabled smartphone will help the driver keep his eyes on the road.
If you are driving the patient without assistance from a third person, calmly inform her that you need to focus on driving but that you will pull over if at any point she requires assistance. This will remind the patient that her safety is of primary importance and that the driver is there to help.
If you are tending to the patient while another person drives, make sure the patient does not bump into or obstruct the view of the driver by keeping her in the back seat.

, Pay attention to signage, keep an eye out for traffic lights, utilize your turn signals, and avoid excessive speed and tail-gating. Traffic laws are put in place to maximize motorists' safety, so your best bet to get to the hospital safely is to comply with these.


If the patient's condition deteriorates rapidly and the situation becomes more dire, you may find it necessary to speed or make turns where prohibited. However, reckless driving should be avoided if possible, as the risk it poses may outweigh the potential benefits of arriving at the hospital a minute sooner. Recklessly driving in a attempt to get there quicker may end in more than one person needing to be treated.
Alerting the 911 operator to your route allows police to be near the area and restrict/control traffic flow if need be.
You can use your vehicle's horn and lights to signal to other drivers that you are experiencing an emergency. Using your emergency flashers, flashing your high-beams, or honking repeatedly while attempting to get around other cars might alert other motorists that something is going on.

, Do not waste time finding parking before you escort the patient into the emergency room reception area. Hospitals and emergency rooms have designated patient drop-off areas, usually located right at the building entrance. You can move the vehicle to an authorized parking spot once the patient has been received by hospital staff.


If you need assistance getting the patient out of the car, you can run inside and quickly ask for help. It is highly likely that someone will be readily available to assist you.
Leave your emergency flashers on when you exit the vehicle to inform others (such as parking enforcement officials) that you intend to move the vehicle shortly. In any case, it is highly unlikely that a vehicle parked in front of an emergency room would incur a citation.

, Provide them with any known, relevant information about the situation. This will help the family how to proceed in making arrangements to visit the patient. Contacting the family will also enable them to attend to the patient's children or pets while she is in the hospital.


Refrain from diagnosing the patient or providing a conjectural prognosis if you have not been informed by a medical professional of the patient's status. Any guesses about the circumstances surrounding the incident or the patient's wellbeing could prove to be false and might unnecessarily upset the family.
If you are acting as a good Samaritan and do not personally know the patient, inform hospital staff that you don't know how to get in touch with the patient's family and that they are potentially unaware of the situation.

, In most cases, hospital staff will want to obtain information from you about the nature of the incident, the patient, and/or the details of the patient's transportation. Be sure to stick around long enough to provide this information if it will be of help to hospital staff. If you are close to the patient, you may also wish to stay at the hospital so you may be notified of her status and/or allowed to see him/her as soon as possible.


In cases where illegal activity or foul play was a contributing factor to the patient's condition, you may be legally obligated to provide a statement of the incident to law enforcement officials. Laws vary by state, so be aware of your state's legislation and the possible existence of any ""good Samaritan laws,"" which offer immunity from legal repercussions under certain circumstances.If the patient was wounded in a confrontation or other situation where another individual was at fault and you have contact information for other witnesses to the incident, furnish these details to hospital staff and/or law enforcement. Such information could be valuable in building support for any potential legal actions or insurance claims on the part of the patient.

, If the patient is required to stay in the hospital overnight for observation or extended treatment, you may wish to bring a change of clothes or other personal belongings/necessities to him/her such as his/her cell phone. This gesture could make her stay in the hospital much more comfortable. This step only applies to individuals who are family members or close friends of the patient.


If the patient is conscious and you are allowed to see him/her, ask if he/she needs anything from home and whether it would be okay for you to retrieve those items for her.
Always check with the patient's doctor before bringing anything into the hospital room. The patient's condition may make certain items unsafe for him/her to use or eat. Hospitals also tend to have high standards of cleanliness, and they might prefer that outside materials not be brought into certain parts of the facility.

, Once the patient is discharged from the hospital, he/she will need transportation home. Unless a family member or friend has already made arrangements to do so, offer to drive the patient. After all, you brought him/her to the hospital in the first place; chances are good he'd/she'd be okay with you taking him/her home, too.


Pull your car up to the hospital exit doors so the patient does not have a long way to go to get to the vehicle. The same guidelines apply to here as to the patient's previous drop-off.
Depending on the patient's condition, he/she might need help getting to the vehicle and getting in and out of it. If you offer transportation, be prepared to also provide whatever assistance the patient requires in order to get home safely.

Remain calm.,
Determine the nature of the emergency.,
Know that sudden changes can be emergencies.,
Be alert for human-caused emergencies.,
Assess the immediate threat.,
Remove yourself from danger.,
Help others leave a hazardous area.,
Seek additional help.",How to Handle an Emergency Situation1," Although emergencies require rapid action, the most important factor in effectively handling the situation is to keep calm. If you find yourself becoming confused or anxious, stop what you're doing. Take a deep breath. Remember that to be calm in a stressful situation you must deliberately adjust your behavior.The reason you feel panicked in an emergency is the result of your body's automatic overproduction of the stress hormone cortisol. The cortisol goes to the brain and slows down the pre-frontal cortex, which is the region responsible for planning complex action.
By overriding your body's reaction, you can continue to access your critical thinking faculties. You won't be responding from emotion, but from rational thought.;
, What signs indicate that there is an emergency? Is this a medical emergency, or is there a threat to the property/building that may result in human injury? It's important to stop and take inventory of the situation calmly before reacting to the emergency.An injury due to motor vehicle accident, or smoke inhalation or burns from a fire are examples of medical emergency situations.
A medical emergency consists of sudden physical symptoms, such as intense bleeding, head trauma, loss of consciousness, chest pain, choking, sudden dizziness or weakness.
Intense desire to hurt yourself or someone else constitute a mental health emergency.
Other mental health changes may also be considered an emergency, such as sudden changes in behavior or experiencing confusion, can be an emergency if they occur without cause.
Behavioral emergencies are best met by remaining calm, and encouraging the person in crisis to stay calm as well.

, Chemical spills, fires, breaking water pipes, electrical outages, natural disasters such as floods or fires are all examples of potential workplace emergencies. If you have advance warning of the possibility of an emergency, such the warning of flood, heavy snow, tornado, etc., you may be better prepared. However, the nature of an emergency is to be unexpected.When assessing emergency situations, be aware that the situation may be volatile. It may change rapidly.
If you have advance warning of an emergency, prepare ahead of time for the best results.

, Assaults or threats of violence at a workplace or home are emergencies that call for rapid response. In most cases, there is no predictable pattern or method to these emergencies. These situations tend to be unpredictable, and they change quickly.If you find yourself in an emergency of this nature, keep yourself safe. Run to a safe location, or find shelter in place. Do not fight, except as a last resort.
Being attentive to warning signs in your workplace, including any act of physical violence (pushing, shoving, etc.) should be immediately reported to your supervisor.
Open, honest communication between employees and supervisors is part of maintaining a safe, healthy workplace.

, For example, if one person appears injured, are you or anyone else in danger of also being injured? For example, if one person is caught in a machine, is the machine turned off? If there has been a chemical spill, is the spill spreading towards anyone else? Is the person caught in structure that's collapsing?


If the threat isn't contained, this will affect your response.
Be aware that any emergency situation may change abruptly, so that ongoing assessment is required.

, If you, or others, are at risk of being harmed, leave the situation immediately. If you have an evacuation plan, follow it. Go to an area where you will be safe.


In a situation where you cannot leave, find the safest possible location within your given area. For example, hiding beneath a solid surface, such as a desk or table, may help if there is a chance of being hit by falling debris.
If you're near a car accident, make sure you're not in the line of oncoming traffic. Get off the road.
Be aware that in an emergency, elements are likely to change quickly. In your assessment, notice if volatile or combustible elements are present. For example, in an auto accident, gasoline may catch fire abruptly.

, If you can safely assist someone else in leaving a dangerous situation, do so. If returning to the emergency situation is risky, a trained rescue person may be better equipped to retrieve anyone in harm's way.


Offering verbal reassurance to an injured person if he is conscious will help another person, even if you can't move him.
If the emergency is stable, stay with the victim.

, In the USA, call 911 for emergency assistance. Use whatever number is applicable to call emergency services outside the U.S. This phone number will reach a emergency dispatcher who will need to know your location and the nature of the emergency.Answer all of the questions the dispatcher asks. The job of the dispatcher is to provide quick, appropriate emergency response. She can only do this by asking these questions.
If you're calling on a traditional telephone or a GPS-equipped cell phone, emergency services may be able to track your location even if you're unable to speak. Even if you can't talk, call emergency services and someone will be able to find you to provide help.

Continue to flush the eye.",How to Handle Pepper Spray in Your Eyes2," The pepper spray residue will not come out of the contact lenses.Throw away the contact lenses immediately.

, The water temperature should be warm, not hot or cold, and should be a temperature that is comfortable for you to flush your eyes for a long time.There are a couple different methods you can use to flush your eye:


Stand under a shower.
Put your face under a faucet with running water.
Spray your open eyes with a kitchen sink sprayer or a garden hose very gently.
Fill a tub or pan with water and then immerse your face in it with eyes open.
Pour water from a pitcher, jug, or water bottle over your open eye., If it is still painful after fifteen minutes, consult a physician. Some sources, however, argue that pain is normal for up to two hours after pepper spray exposure to the eyes."

Submerge your face into the soap and water solution.,
Immerse your hands in the solution.,
Work the solution into affected parts of the skin gradually.,
Continue this process for 15 to 45 minutes.",How to Handle Pepper Spray in Your Eyes3," You should first soothe the skin with whole milk and then take away the pepper spray residue with a soap and water solution. While whole milk will not remove the oils causing your skin to burn, it will ease the burn. There are several ways you can apply whole milk to your skin:Put whole milk in a spray bottle and spray your skin.
Pour it on a cloth or towel and then apply the cloth to your skin.
Splash it directly onto your skin.

, The solution should be 75% water and 25% dish soap, like Dawn. Make at least a gallon of this solution.

, Do this for ten to fifteen seconds at a time, if your face is affected. Do not touch your face. Repeat this until your face begins to feel normal.

, In removing the spray you may have gotten some on your hands. Soak your hands in the solution to remove the spray. Eventually, you may use your hands to use a solution-soaked towel or cloth to clean other affected parts of your body.

, The solution may activate the capillaries a little bit, which might be painful; however, this process will take the oils from the pepper spray out of your skin.

, The process of getting the pepper spray out is gradual. Be patient and remain calm."

Remove the mask.,
Throw away the mask.",How to Wear an N95 Medical Mask," Protective N95 masks are ideal for certain uses, such as construction work, but may not be for others such as invasive surgical procedures. Figuring out when to select a N95 mask over other options can ensure you get proper protection. Times you may want to wear an N95 mask include:Having an increased risk for of illness from influenza or other respiratory diseases
Being exposed to smog or environmental allergens
Caring for patients who don’t require invasive proceduresDoing demolition or construction work;
, If you have a pre-existing medical condition such as emphysema or asthma, see if you are healthy enough to use an N95 mask. Wearing an N95 mask can make breathing more difficult if you have any of the following pre-existing conditions:Breathing problems
Emphysema
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Asthma
Cardio-pulmonary problems

, Purchase your N95 mask from a medical supply store, local hardware store or a home improvement center. Find or ask where the N95 masks are and read the packaging. Select only masks certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). These have the NIOSH logo and the test and certification approval number (TC) on the packaging and/or the mask.Masks not certified by NIOSH may not provide adequate protection.

, Each brand and model of N95 respirators comes in different size configurations. These are not standard across models. Try different, certified models of N95 to see if one particular works best with your face.Look for the following fit characteristics:

Comfort
Tight seal to the faceNo air leakage
Covers nose, mouth, and chin, Before you touch or put on your N95 mask, thoroughly clean your hands.Use any kind of soap and water and rub your hands under the flow for at least 20 seconds. You can also alcohol-based hand sanitizer if you don’t have soap and water. This can ensure no particles or other substances get into your mask.Dry your hands thoroughly after washing. This can ensure your mask isn’t saturated with water.

, Pick up your mask and place it in your hands. The metal nosepiece should be at your fingertips and the respirator in your palm. The headbands should be hanging down., Cup the N95 in your hands and lightly set the bottom part under your chin. The headbands should still be below your hand. Tip up the mask so that it covers your nose. The metal piece should touch the bridge of your nose., With your other hand, pull the bottom headband over your head. It should be below the ears and around your neck. Then pull the second headband over your head and place it high at the back of your head.Avoid crisscrossing the bands. This can affect the seal and may not protect you fully from particles., Place your fingertips from both hands on either side of the top of your nose. You should feel the metal piece under your fingers. Slide your fingertips down the metal strip simultaneously. This molds the metal strip and mask to the contours of your face and nose, ensuring a proper seal., Put both hands over the mask and respirator. Breathe in quickly and see if the mask seals tightly to your face. Then exhale and see if you feel any leakage. Feeling air leak or not having the mask seal when you inhale is a sign that you need to adjust the mask.Readjust the headbands if air leaks at the mask’s edges. If you have leaks around the nose or respirator, adjust the metal nosepiece.

, Pull the bottom strap over your head and then follow with the top strap. Hold the mask by its strap. Touching the front of the respirator may expose you to particles or other contaminated matter., Used respirators are considered contaminated after each use.Holding the mask by its straps, dispose of it after each use. This can ensure you don’t come into contact with contaminated particles or other hazardous matter. It also ensures that you’re not using a clogged up N95 that may not filter properly."

Determine if you can do anything to help.,
Take time to think before acting.,
Get the first aid kit.,
Ask basic questions of the injured person.,
Avoid moving an injured person.,
Use the telephone only to ask for help.",How to Handle an Emergency Situation2," The most important thing you can do is to remain calm, and stay in control of the situation. Sometimes there is nothing that you can do, and that's fine. Don't be worried about admitting that there's nothing you can do to help.If there are others on the scene who may be upset or fearful, reassure them. Employ them in going to get help.
It's better to remain with someone in a supportive way than to do an action that may result in additional damage. If you're not sure what to do, simply stay with the person.

, Being in an emergency situation can result in panicked thinking and actions. Instead of reacting to a situation, take time to calm down. Breathe deeply before you take any action.Things change suddenly in emergency situations. Don't panic if things suddenly go in a different direction than you'd expected.
Take time to pause whenever you're overwhelmed, panicky or confused. If you need to stop in the middle of taking an action to calm down, that's okay.

, A first aid kit should have constructive tools for taking care of many medical emergencies. Any first aid kit should contain bandages, gauze, adhesive tape, disinfectant, and other useful items.If you can't retrieve the first aid kit, consider what other items in your immediate vicinity might be good substitutes.
You should keep a first aid kit at your home, and your workplace is required by law to maintain a first aid kit.
A good first aid kit should also have a ""space blanket"" which is a light-weight piece of special material meant to conserve body heat.

, It's important to discern the mental state of the victim in order to better understand the person's injuries. If the person appears confused by the question, or provides the wrong answer, this may suggest additional injuries. If you're not sure if the victim is unconscious, touch their shoulder. Shout or ask loudly, ""Are you okay?""Questions you should ask include: What is your name? What is the date? How old are you?
Once you've determined the basic mental status of the person, check with them about any medical complications. Ask them if they have a medical alert bracelet or another medical ID.

, If someone has a neck injury, moving him could result in injuring the spine. Always call emergency services if someone has an neck injury and is unable to move himself.If the person can't walk because of leg or foot injuries, you can help move them by holding them at the shoulders.
If the person is afraid to leave a dangerous situation, respond with reassurance.

, Your full attention should be on the present situation, and talking on the phone is distracting. In addition, if you are on an older model telephone, the emergency dispatcher may be trying to reach you. Stay off the phone unless you're calling to ask for help.


If you're not sure if you're in a true emergency, call emergency services and the dispatcher can help you figure out if emergency officials should be sent.
Don't try to document the emergency unless you are sure you are out of danger. Taking ""selfies"" or posting about your situation on social media in ongoing emergency situations may result in additional injury.

Have an emergency plan.,
Know your physical address.,
Identify your closest exits.,
Take a first aid course.,
Consider taking CPR in addition to first aid.,
Know what chemicals are found in your home or workplace.,
Keep emergency phone numbers posted near the phone.,
Wear a medical ID tag if you have a chronic health condition.",How to Handle an Emergency Situation3," The best response in an emergency situation is to follow the emergency plan of your home or workplace. Certain people may be identified as emergency leaders, with special training. In an emergency, you will save necessary time and energy by following the plan.Your emergency plan should have an assembly place to gather once you've evacuated the home or building.
Keep emergency phone numbers posted near the phone.
Important medical data should be stored in your phone or your wallet.

, You'll need to know your location in order to tell any emergency dispatcher where to send help. While it may be easy to know the address of your home, it's also important to memorize the address of your workplace. Get into the habit of checking the address wherever you are.If you don't know the physical address, be ready to say the name of the street you're on and any nearby intersections or landmarks.
If your cell phone has GPS, you can use it to determine your physical address. However, this wastes much needed time in an emergency.

, Always be aware of the exits to any building you're in, whether they're home, office, or commercial locations. Identify at least 2 exits, in case one is blocked. In a workplace or public location, exits should be clearly marked.Choose two places where you can regather with your family or coworkers. One location should be outside the home or workplace. The other location should be outside the immediate vicinity, in case the neighborhood is unsafe.
Emergency exits should be physically accessible, according to ADA laws.

, Having a first aid kit isn't helpful unless you have training to use it. Having training to properly apply bandages, compresses, tourniquets and other tools will help in an emergency. The Red Cross regularly offers these courses in most areas of the US.Many Red Cross courses are also offered online.
First aid courses can be age specific. If you have children, or just want to know how to help children in case of an emergency, take a first aid course specific to assisting children in an emergency. If you work with children, you'll be required by law to receive this training.

, Having CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) training is a life-saving help for someone having a heart attack. If you haven't taken a CPR course, you can still offer chest compressions for someone suspected of having a heart attack.A chest compression is hard pressure applied swiftly to the ribcage at the rate of 100 compressions per minute, or just over 1 per second.
CPR for children and infants is taught by the Red Cross. If you have children, take a course in providing CPR for children in order to be prepared in case of an emergency. If you work with children, you may be required by law to receive this training.

, If the emergency occurs in your workplace, you should know where to find the MSDS (Material Data Safety Sheet) for any chemical used. Having a list of the chemicals used in your home or workplace, together with any first aid measures required in case of emergency, will be the most effective way you can prepare for emergency situations.Your workplace should have an eyewash station if you regularly come into contact with hazardous chemicals.
Make sure you are prepared to share any relevant information regarding chemicals with your emergency response team.

, Post the number for 911 as well as other important medical phone numbers, including the phone numbers of family members who should be contacted. The phone number of the poison control center, ambulance center, your doctors' phone numbers should be posted alongside contact numbers of neighbors or nearby friends or relatives, and work phone numbers.All members of your house, including your children, should be able to access these phone numbers in case of an emergency.
For children, elderly or disabled people, consider having a posted script to help them remember what to tell others when calling on the phone with an emergency situation.

, If you have a condition that a medical response team should be aware of, such as diabetes, certain allergies, epilepsy or other seizure disorder, or other medical conditions, a medical ID tag can provide this information should you be unable to.Most medical responders look on a person's wrist for medical ID tags. The second most common place to look is at the person's neck, as a necklace.
People with certain behavioral conditions, such as Tourette syndrome, autism, dementia, etc., may wish to consider wearing medical ID badges to help any emergency responder better understand their behavior.

Keep a record of your results.,
Walk around.",How to Use Voldyne 5000," When using the Voldyne 5000 under the care of a doctor, nurse, or respiratory therapist, this healthcare professional will typically have a goal a mind.


The Voldyne 5000 has a goal range between 250 and 2500 ml, so your goal should fall somewhere within this range. These numbers indicate the amount of air volume your lungs are able to intake.
While it's usually best to begin the procedure with a volume goal in mind, it isn't strictly necessary for the first use. You should still use your results from each use to adjust your goal later on, though.;
, Look for the yellow marker tab on the side of the large graduated column. Move the tab up or down until it rests at the position labeled with your desired goal.If you do not have a goal during your first use, you do not need to set the pointer to any measurement yet. You will need to use the pointer later on, though.

, Move to the end of your bed or chair and sit up straight. If desired, you could lean slightly forward, but you should not allow yourself to slouch or slump over.


Similarly, you should not allow your head to tilt backward, either.
If you cannot move to the edge of your bed, you should at least sit up as far as possible while sitting in bed. When using an adjustable hospital bed, you may use the controls to raise the head of your bed to assist you as you sit.

, Keep the device in an upright position with all labels facing you.Keep the device as level as possible so that the procedure will work correctly and all readings will be accurate.
You should have a clear view of the marker tab, goal piston, and main piston. Note that the goal piston is the yellow cylinder resting beneath the ""Good, Better, Best"" label at the side of the device and the main piston is the large white disc at the bottom of the large cylinder.

, Breathe out naturally, expelling as much air from your lungs as possible.Exhale through your mouth instead of your nose to push out more air at a quicker pace.
A complete exhale is important. If you only exhale partially, you won't be able to inhale as deeply as you would with emptied lungs, making it more difficult to reach your goal point or obtain accurate results.

, Firmly press your lips around the mouthpiece to create a tight seal.


Reposition your tongue as needed to make sure that it does not block the mouthpiece and hinder usage.
You must create and maintain a tight seal with your lips. Otherwise, some of the air you inhale will come from outside the Voldyne 5000, and the resulting measurement will be lower than it should be.

, Take a deep, slow breath. Continue breathing in until you either reach your marked goal or are no longer able to inhale further.


If you're maintaining an adequately tight seal with your lips, this inhale should seem similar to the feeling of drinking a thick liquid through a small straw.
Watch the goal piston as it bounces between ""Good,"" ""Better,"" and ""Best."" This indicator measures the speed of your inhale, and a slower inhale will create a better reading. Try to keep it within the ""Better"" and ""Best"" ranges. Inhaling slowly gives the air sacs in your lungs more time to open, which will make it easier to get a deeper breath.
Watch the main piston, as well. Try to make this piston reach the goal marked by the yellow pointer. You can allow the piston to rise higher, but you should not try to force it.

, Once you've finished inhaling, pause and hold your breath for a minimum of 3 seconds.Watch the main piston as you hold your breath. It should gradually drop back down to bottom or ""zero"" position. Once it does, you can proceed to the next step.

, Take the mouthpiece out of your mouth and breathe out at a normal, comfortable pace.


As before, try to expel all of the air from your lungs on this exhale.
If you feel winded or if your lungs are otherwise tired, take a few normal breaths before continuing to the next step. You should still end on an exhale before advancing, though.

, Unless you are told otherwise by your nurse or respiratory therapist, you should move the plastic indicator to the highest point you reached during the procedure.


This allows you to adjust your goal based on your lungs' current abilities. When repeating this exercise, make your adjusted mark your new goal.

, Repeat this procedure as directed by your healthcare provider. Typically, you should follow the procedure 10 to 15 times during each sitting.


If your nurse or therapist did not assign a set number of repeats, aim for at least 10. You can do more, but stop if you feel lightheaded, dizzy, or too exhausted to continue.
Do not attempt to rush through the process. Work through it gradually and breath normally in between each repeat. If you feel lightheaded or dizzy, pause for a greater amount of time between repeats.
Adjust the yellow goal marker each time you complete the procedure, but only make an adjustment if you reach a higher goal point. Do not adjust the pointer to a lower position unless your doctor, nurse, or therapist instructs you to do so.

, After you finish the full procedure, breathe deeply and cough two or three times.


Coughing should help clear the mucus from your lungs, making it easier for you to breathe.
If you had surgery on your chest or stomach, or if you feel pain while you cough, hold a pillow or folded blanket firmly against your chest while coughing. Applying pressure to the site of the incision in this manner should support the area and reduce the amount of pain you feel.

, Thoroughly clean the mouthpiece with soap and water after each use. Rinse well and dry with clean paper towels.If desired, you could clean the mouthpiece with an antiseptic mouth rinse instead of using soap and water.
When using soap and water, however, you must make sure to rinse away all soap before using the spirometer again.
On the Voldyne 5000, the standard mouthpiece is meant to be a permanent one. Use this mouthpiece each time you use the device. If you switch to a disposable mouthpiece, though, you should not use the same one for more than 24 hours.

, You will need to use the device in the same manner every one to two hours, or as directed by your nurse, doctor, or respiratory therapist.


Note that in most cases, however, you should only follow this schedule during your normal waking hours. Your body needs adequate rest to make a full recovery, so you shouldn't wake yourself up in the middle of the night to repeat the exercise.

, While not strictly necessary, it's a good idea to keep a log indicating your results. This log should contain an entry for each time you use the Voldyne 5000.


For each entry, mark down the time of day, the number of repeats you performed, and the volume amount you managed to reach.
The purpose of this record is monitor the progress made by your lungs, and to keep track of any increases or decreases to the functional abilities of your lungs.
Your healthcare provider might keep a similar record, but you should still keep your own so that you can keep track of your progress yourself.

, When you are well enough to safely get out of bed and move around on your own, practice walking around in between uses. While walking, breathe deeply and cough two or three times.Practicing the cough while you walk can clear your lungs more thoroughly and make it even easier to breathe.

Wash your hands.,
Place the medication into the nebulizer.,
Attach the mouthpiece.,
Connect the tubing.",How to Use a Nebulizer1," Start by washing your hands for 20 seconds with soap under running water. Rinse your hands and dry them off with a paper towel. Turn off the faucet using a paper towel., Unscrew the top of the nebulizer cup and put the prescribed medication into the nebulizer. Many types of respiratory medications for nebulizer treatments come in pre-measured doses. If yours is not pre-measured, measure out the exact amount prescribed for one dose. Secure the top tightly to prevent the medication from spilling out. Don't forget to plug the air compressor into an electrical outlet if it is not battery operated.


Medications that can be put in the nebulizer include inhaled beta agonist and anticholinergics, inhaled glucocorticoids, and inhaled antibiotics. Other inhaled medications are available for the treatment of non-respiratory diseases. Not all drugs can be aerosolized.
The jet, or pneumatic, nebulizer is the most common type. Newer nebulizers are designed to deliver the entire mediation during inhalation. Nebulizer performance can be affected by nebulizer method, mechanism of aerosol formation, and drug formation. If you need instructions about how to use your nebulizer, talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist.

, Secure it to the nebulizer cup. Although different manufactures may have slightly different jet nebulizers, most mouthpieces will attach to the top of the nebulizer cup. Most nebulizers have mouth pieces instead of face masks, since masks can lead to facial deposits.

, Attach one end of the oxygen tubing to the nebulizer cup. On most types of nebulizers, the tubing will connect on the bottom of the cup. Connect the other end of the tubing to an air compressor used for nebulizers."

Understand the parts of a cane.,
Handle the cane.,
Know how to walk.,
Know how to use the stairs.,
Practice using a cane; it takes a while to get used to.",How to Use a White Tipped Cane," Generally speaking this will mean that the cane grip will reach your armpit when the tip is resting on the floor.;
, Generally a right-handed person should use their left hand.

, Note that all canes consist of 3 main parts; the grip, the tip, and the cane. Hold the grip firmly but loosely in your hand. If it has a flat surface, (like a golf club grip) lay your index finger on the flat surface.

, Let your wrist settle to somewhere between your belly button and waist, slightly to one side, and gently swing the cane from side to side. The tip should always stay in contact with the ground, swinging approximately the width of your shoulders.

, When you walk, alternate the swing with your steps. As you step with the right foot, your cane should go to the left, and vice versa. If you find that your cane is swinging in the wrong direction, let the cane stay in that general direction and fix it with your next few steps. Your head should be held high and you shoulders kept relaxed. This will allow you to use any remaining vision and whatever hearing you have to aid your mobility.

, When going down stairs, let the cane tip fall onto the next step and don't swing it in case other people are trying to go down the stairs too. When going up the stairs, the cane will hit the first step when you are on the ground level. Grab the cane so it's relatively vertical, and let the cane hit each step as you ascend. Once you reach the top, go back to swinging. When going down the stairs, let the cane tip fall onto the next step and then step down to it. For a smoother descent push the cane forward along the step and allow the cane drop two steps below, so that it is always a step ahead of you.


Keep the cane from swinging to allow other people to use the stairs.
When pushing the cane forward doesn't result in it dropping you know you've reached the end of that set of stairs. To avoid a nasty fall, remember that after the cane has reached the bottom of the stairs, you still have another step to take!

, Make sure you are confident in your cane mobility skills before going out alone.

Get a high quality stethoscope.,
Adjust your stethoscope’s earpieces.,
Check the earpiece tension on your stethoscope.,
Choose an appropriate chest piece for your stethoscope.",How to Use a Stethoscope1," A high quality stethoscope is important. The better the quality of your stethoscope, the easier it will be for you to listen to your patient’s body.


Single tubed stethoscopes are better than double tubed ones. The tubes in double tubed stethoscopes can rub together. This noise can make it hard to hear heart sounds.Thick, short, and relatively stiff tubing is best, unless you plan to wear the stethoscope around your neck. In that case, a longer tube is best.Make sure that tubing is free of leaks by tapping on the diaphragm (the flat side of the chest piece). As you tap, use the earpieces to listen for sounds. If you don’t hear anything, there may be a leak.;
, It is important to make sure that the earpieces are facing forward and that they fit well. Otherwise, you might not be able to hear anything with your stethoscope.Make sure that the earpieces are facing forward. If you put them in backwards, you won’t be able to hear anything.Make sure that the earpieces fit snugly and have a good seal to keep out ambient noise. If the ear pieces don’t fit well, most stethoscopes have removable earpieces. Visit a medical supply store to purchase different earpieces.With some stethoscopes, you can also tilt the earpieces forward stethoscopes to ensure a better fit., In other words, make sure that the earpieces are close to your head but not too close. If your earpieces are too tight or too loose, readjust them.If the earpieces are too loose, you may not be able to hear anything. To tighten the tension, squeeze the headset near the earpieces.If the earpieces are too tight, they might hurt your ears and you might have a hard time using your stethoscope. To reduce the tension, pull the headset apart gently., There are many different types of chest pieces available for stethoscopes. Choose one that is appropriate for your needs. Chest pieces come in different sizes for adults and children.

Turn on the air compressor and use the nebulizer.,
Continue to inhale the medication.,
Turn off the nebulizer and clean up.,
Disinfect the nebulizer once a week.",How to Use a Nebulizer2," Put the mouthpiece into your mouth, above the tongue, and keep your lips sealed tightly around it. Inhale slowly and deeply in through your mouth so that all the medicine goes into your lungs. Exhale either through your mouth or nose. For adults, holding the nose closed can help ensure the medicine is inhaled through the mouth.


Consider using an aerosol mask as an alternative to a mouthpiece for young children or people that are too ill to hold the mouthpiece. Aerosol masks attach to the top of the nebulizer cup. The mask comes in pediatric and adult sizes.

, Sit up and keep inhaling the medication until the mist stops. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes. Once all liquid is gone, the mist stops coming out. The nebulizer cup should be empty. Distract yourself by watching TV or listening to music.


Set up an activity to occupy young children during the nebulizer treatment. Puzzles, books or coloring may help the child sit still for the length of the treatment. Ideally, hold the child in your lap since the child should be sitting straight up to receive the optimal dosage of medication., Be sure to unplug it from the outlet and detach the medicine cup and mouthpiece from the tubing. Wash the medicine cup and mouthpiece with warm soapy water and rinse them with water. Place the equipment on a clean towel to fully air dry. Make sure to do this after each treatment and daily.


Don't wash the tubing. If it gets wet, replace the tubing. Also, don't put any parts of the nebulizer into a dishwasher to clean it because the heat can warp the plastic.

, To disinfect, always follow the manufacturer's guidelines. Soak all parts, except for the tubing, in one part white distilled vinegar to three parts hot water for one hour. Discard the solution. Rinse the parts, except for the tubing, in cold water and air dry them on a clean towel. After the parts are dry, store them in a clean area in the case.For cleanliness, if more than one person is needs a nebulizer, do not share equipment even if it is washed. Each person should use his or her own nebulizer.

Select a quiet place to use your stethoscope.,
Position your patient.,
Decide whether to use the diaphragm or bell.,
Have your patient put on a hospital gown or lift up clothing to expose skin.",How to Use a Stethoscope2," Use your stethoscope in a quiet place. Find a quiet area to ensure that the body sounds you want to hear will not be overpowered by background noises.

, To listen to the heart and abdomen, you will want to have your patient get into a supine position. To listen to the lungs, you will want your patient to sit up. In other words, ask your patient to lay down.Heart, lung, and bowel sounds may sound different depending on the patient's position: i.e., sitting, standing, lying on one's side, etc.., The diaphragm, or flat side of the drum, is better for hearing medium- or high-pitched sounds. The bell, or round side of the drum, is better for hearing low-pitched sounds.If you want a stethoscope with really high sound quality, you might want to consider an electronic stethoscope. An electronic stethoscope provides amplification so that it is easier to hear heart and lung sounds. Using an electronic stethoscope may make it easier to hear your patient’s heart and lungs, but keep in mind that they are expensive., Use the stethoscope on bare skin to avoid picking up the sound of rustling fabric. If your patient is a man with chest hair, keep the stethoscope still to avoid any rustling sounds.To make your patient more comfortable, warm up the stethoscope by rubbing it on your sleeve, or consider buying a stethoscope warmer.

Hold the diaphragm over the patient’s heart.,
Listen to the heart for a full minute.,
Count the number of heartbeats you hear in a minute.,
Listen for abnormal heart sounds.",How to Use a Stethoscope3," Position the diaphragm on the left upper part of the chest where the 4th to 6th ribs meet, almost directly under the breast. Hold the stethoscope between your pointer and middle fingers and apply enough gentle pressure so that you don’t hear your fingers rubbing together., Ask the patient to relax and breathe normally. You should hear the normal sounds of the human heart, which sound like “lub-dub.” These sounds are also called systolic and diastolic. Systolic is the “lub” sound and diastolic is the “dub” sound.The “lub,” or systolic, sound happens when the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart close.
The “dub,” or diastolic, sound happens when the aortic and pulmonic valves close.

, The normal resting heart rate for adults and children over 10 years old is between 60-100 beats per minute. For well-trained athletes, the normal resting heart rate may only be between 40-60 beats per minute.There are several different ranges of resting heart rates to consider for patients under 10 years old. Those ranges include:Newborns up to one month old: 70-190 beats per minute
Infants 1 - 11 months old: 80 - 160 beats per minute
Children 1 - 2 years old: 80 - 130 beats per minute
Children 3 - 4 years old: 80 - 120 beats per minute
Children 5 - 6 years old: 75 - 115 beats per minute
Children 7 - 9 years old: 70 - 110 beats per minute



, As you count the heartbeats, you should also listen for any abnormal sounds. Anything that does not sound like lub-dub may be considered abnormal. If you hear anything abnormal, your patient may need further evaluation by a doctor.If you hear a whooshing sound or a sound that is more like “lub...shhh...dub,” your patient might have a heart murmur. A heart murmur is blood rushing quickly through the valves. Many people have what are called “innocent” heart murmurs.But some heart murmurs do point to issues with heart valves, so you should advise your patient to see a doctor if you detect a heart murmur.If you hear a third heart sound that is like a low frequency vibration, your patient might have a ventricular defect. This third heart sound is referred to as S3 or a ventricular gallop. Advise the patient to see a doctor if you hear a third heart sound.Try listening to samples of normal and abnormal heart sounds to help you determine if what you are hearing is normal.

Ask your patient to sit straight up and breathe normally.,
Use the diaphragm of your stethoscope to listen to your patient’s lungs.,
Listen for normal breath sounds.,
Listen for abnormal breath sounds.",How to Use a Stethoscope4," As you listen, you can ask the patient to take a deep breath if you cannot hear breath sounds or if they are too quiet to determine if there are any abnormalities.

, Listen to the patient’s lungs in the upper and lower lobes, and on the front and back of the patient.


As you listen place the stethoscope on the upper part of the chest, then the midclavicular line of the chest, and then the bottom part of the chest. Make sure to listen to the front and back of all of these regions.
Make sure to compare both sides of your patient’s lungs and note if anything is abnormal.
By covering all of these positions you will be able to listen to all of the lobes of your patient’s lungs., Normal breath sounds are clear, like listening to someone blowing air into a cup. Listen to a sample of healthy lungs and then compare the sounds to what you hear in your patient’s lungs.


There are two types of normal breath sounds:Bronchial breath sounds are those heard within the tracheobronchial tree.
Vesicular breath sounds are those heard over the lung tissue.



, Abnormal breath sounds include wheezing, stridor, rhonchi, and rales. If you do not hear any breath sounds, the patient may have air or fluid around the lungs, thickness around the chest wall, or airflow that is slowed down or over inflation to the lungs.There are four types of abnormal breath sounds:

Wheezing sounds like a high pitched sound when the person exhales, and sometimes when they inhale as well. Many patients who have asthma also have wheezes, and sometimes you can even hear the wheezing without a stethoscope.Stridor sounds like high-pitched musical breathing, similar to wheezing, heard most often when the patient inhales. Stridor is caused by a blockage in the back of the throat. This sound can also often be heard without a stethoscope.Rhonchi sounds like snoring. Rhonchi cannot be heard without a stethoscope and happens because the air is following a “rough” path through the lungs or because it is blocked.Rales sounds like popping bubble wrap or rattling in the lungs. Rales can be heard when a person inhales."
"
Place the diaphragm on your patient’s bare stomach.,
Listen for normal bowel sounds.,
Listen for abnormal bowel sounds.",How to Use a Stethoscope5," Use your patient’s belly button as the center and divide your listening around the belly button into four sections. Listen to the upper left, upper right, lower left and right., Normal bowel sounds sound like when your stomach growls or grumbles.Anything else may suggest that something is wrong and that the patient requires further evaluation.You should hear “growling” in all four sections. Sometimes after surgery, bowel sounds will take a while to return., Most of the sounds that you hear when listening to your patient’s bowels are just the sounds of digestion. Although most bowel sounds are normal, there are some abnormalities that could point to a problem. If you are unsure if the bowel sounds you hear are normal and/or the patient has other symptoms, then the patient should see a doctor for further evaluation.If you do not hear any bowel sounds, that may mean that something is blocked in the patient’s stomach. It can also indicate constipation and bowel sounds may return on their own. But if they do not return, then there may be a blockage. In this case, the patient would need further evaluation by a doctor. If the patient has hyperactive bowel sounds followed by a lack of bowel sounds, that could indicate that there has been a rupture or necrosis of the bowel tissue.If the patient has very high-pitched bowel sounds, this may indicate that there is an obstruction in the patient’s bowels.Slow bowel sounds may be caused by prescription drugs, spinal anesthesia, infection, trauma, abdominal surgery, or overexpansion of the bowel.Fast, or hyperactive bowel sounds can be caused by Crohn’s disease, a gastrointestinal bleed, food allergies, diarrhea, infection, and ulcerative colitis."

Determine if you need to check for a bruit.,
Place the diaphragm of your stethoscope over one of the carotid arteries.,
Listen for bruits.",How to Use a Stethoscope6," If you have detected a sound that seems like a heart murmur, you should also check for a bruit. Since heart murmurs and bruits sound similar, it is important to check for both if one is suspected.

, The carotid arteries are located in the front of your patient’s neck, on either side of the Adam’s apple. If you take your index and middle finger and run them down the front of your throat, you will trace over the locations of your two carotid arteries.Be careful not to press too hard on the artery or you may cut off circulation and cause your patient to faint. Never press on both carotid arteries at the same time., A bruit makes a whooshing sound that indicates that an artery is narrowed. Sometimes a bruit may be confused with a murmur because they sound similar, but if the patient has a bruit then the whooshing sound will be louder when you listen to the carotid artery than when you listen to the heart.You may also want to listen for bruits over the abdominal aorta, renal arteries, iliac arteries and femoral arteries.

Take rectal temperature readings on newborns.,
Choose where to measure temperature on toddlers cautiously.,
Choose any thermometer and measure any area for older children and adults.,
Use a digital thermometer orally.,
Use a digital thermometer rectally.,
Use a digital thermometer under the arms.,
Use a tympanic thermometer.,
Use a plastic strip thermometer.,
Learn how to interpret the readings.",How to Use a Thermometer," The best or most appropriate type of thermometer and where to measure body temperature depends mostly on age. From birth to about six months of age, using a regular digital thermometer to take a rectal (anal) temperature is recommended because it's considered the most accurate.Earwax, ear infections, and small, curved ear canals interfere with the accuracy of ear thermometers (also called tympanic thermometers), so they are not the best types to use for newborns.
Some research suggests that temporal artery thermometers are also good options for newborns due to accuracy and reproducibility. The temporal artery can be seen in the temple region of the head.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against using old-style glass thermometers that contain mercury.The glass can break and mercury is poisonous to people, so digital thermometers are safer options.;
, Up to an age of about three years (and maybe as old as five), a rectal reading from a digital thermometer still provides the most accurate reading for core body temperature.You can use a digital ear thermometer at younger ages to get general readings (better than no reading at all), but until about the age of three years or so, readings from the rectum, armpit, and temporal artery are considered more accurate. Because mild-to-moderate fevers in toddlers can be more dangerous than in adults, an accurate temperature reading during the younger years is particularly important.


Ear infections are common and occur with regular frequency in newborns and toddlers, which affect the readings of infrared ear thermometers due to inflammation within the ear. Consequently, ear thermometers typically give overly high readings with ear infections.
Regular digital thermometers are pretty versatile and can record temperatures from the mouth (under the tongue), armpit, or rectum and are appropriate to use on newborns, toddlers, older children, and adults.

, Beyond three-to-five years of age, kids tend to get fewer ear infections and it's much easier to clean their ears and remove wax build up. Wax in the ear canal prevents ear thermometers from accurately reading the infrared radiation coming off the eardrum.Furthermore, children's ear canals eventually grow and become less curved. Consequently, beyond three-to-five years of age, all types of thermometers used in most areas of the body are pretty comparable in terms of accuracy.


Digital ear thermometers are often considered the quickest, easiest, and least messy way of taking body temperatures.
Using a regular digital thermometer rectally is very accurate, but likely the most unpleasant and messy way of recording body temperature.
Heat sensitive strips that stick onto the forehead are convenient and affordable, but not as precise of accurate compared to digital thermometers.There are also ""forehead"" thermometers that are different from plastic strip thermometers. These are more expensive, usually used in the hospital setting, and utilize infrared technology to obtain readings at the temporal region.

, The mouth (oral cavity) is considered to be a reliable representation for body temperature when the thermometer is placed far back under the tongue.As such, take the digital thermometer out of its holder and turn it on; slide the metal tip into a new disposable plastic cover (if one is available); carefully place it as far back under the tongue as possible; then close your lips gently around the thermometer until it beeps and gives a reading. It may take a few minutes, so breath through your nose while waiting.


If you do not have a disposable cover, clean the end of the probe with soap and warm water (or rubbing alcohol), then rinse it with cool water.
Wait for 20-30 minutes after smoking, eating or drinking hot/cold liquids before taking oral readings.Core temperatures of people average about 98.6 °F or 37 °C (although it varies due to many factors), but oral temperatures taken with a digital thermometer tend to be slightly lower with an average reading of 98.2 °F or 36.8 °C., A rectal reading is usually reserved for toddlers and newborns, although it is also very accurate for adults, albeit maybe somewhat uncomfortable. Before inserting a digital thermometer into the anus, make sure to lubricate it with some water-soluble or petroleum-based jelly first.Lubrication is typically placed over the probe cover — it allows for easier insertion and increased comfort. Spread the buttocks (it's easier if the patient is lying on their stomach) and insert the tip of the thermometer no more than 1/2 an inch into the rectum. Never force it if resistance is encountered. Be prepared to wait a minute or more for the thermometer to beep, then slowly remove it.


Be especially thorough while cleaning your hands and thermometer after taking a rectal reading because E. coli bacteria from fecal material can cause serious infections.
For rectal measurements, consider buying a digital thermometer with a fairly flexible tip on the end because it will provide more comfort.
Rectal measurements from digital thermometers can be as much as one degree higher than oral and axillary (armpit) readings., The underarm or axillary area is another place to measure body temperature, although it's not considered as accurate as the mouth, rectum, or ear (tympanic membrane).After putting a probe cover on the tip of the digital thermometer, make sure the armpit is dry before you insert it. Place the probe into the middle of the armpit (pointing upwards toward the head) and then make sure the arm is close to the body so the body heat is trapped. Wait at least a few minutes or until the thermometer beeps with a reading.


Wait at least one hour after heavy exercise or a hot bath before taking body temperature from the axilla or anywhere else.For better accuracy, take readings from both armpits and then average the two temperatures together.
Axillary measurements with a digital thermometer tend to be lower than other areas, with an average normal temperature being around 97.7 °F (36.5 °C)., A tympanic thermometer is shaped differently from normal digital thermometers because it is specifically designed to fit into the ear canal. Tympanic thermometers sense reflected infrared (heat) emissions from the tympanic membrane (eardrum).Before sticking the thermometer into the ear canal, make sure it's free of wax and dry. Wax buildup and other debris in the ear canal reduces the accuracy of readings. After turning the ear thermometer on and placing a sterile cover on the tip, hold the head still and pull back on the top part of the ear to straighten out the canal and make it easier for insertion. There's no need to touch the eardrum with the tip because the thermometer is designed to take a remote reading. After creating a seal around the thermometer by pressing it against the canal, wait for it to take a reading and beep.


The safest and most effective way to clean ears is by using a few drops of warm olive oil, almond oil, mineral oil or special ear drops to soften the earwax, then rinse it all out (irrigate it) with some squirts of water from a little rubber device made for ear cleaning.Cleaning the ear is easiest if performed after a shower or bath.
Do not use an ear thermometer on an ear that is infected, injured, or recovering from surgery.
An advantage of using an ear thermometer is that, when positioned properly, they are quick and fairly accurate.Ear thermometers tend to be more expensive than regular digital thermometers, but their cost has come down substantially over the last decade.

, Strip-type thermometers are held against the forehead and are relatively popular for taking children's temperature, but they are quite variable in their accuracy.These thermometers use liquid crystals that react to heat by changing color to show the temperature of the skin, but not inside the body. Strip-type thermometers are usually stuck to the skin of the forehead (horizontally) for at least a minute before they are read. Before applying them, make sure the forehead is not sweating from physical activity or badly sunburned — both situations will affect the reading.


It's difficult to get readings in the 1/10 of degrees because the liquid crystals tend to show a range of temperature when they change color.
For more accuracy, place the strip closer to the temple region of the head (over the pulsating temporal artery near the hairline). The blood in the temporal better reflects the internal core temperature.

, Keep in mind that newborns have lower than normal body temperatures compared to adults — typically less than 97 °F, versus a normal of 98.6 °F in adults.Thus, a temperature reading that indicates a mild fever in adults (100 °F or 37.8 °C, for example), could be more significant for a baby or infant. Furthermore, the different types of thermometers have slightly different ranges of normal because they measure body heat from different locations. For example, your child has a fever if they: have a rectal or ear temperature reading of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher, an oral reading of 100 °F (37.8 °C) or higher, and/or an armpit reading of 99 °F (37.2 °C) or higher.In general, contact your doctor if: your baby (3 months or younger) has a rectal temperature of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher; your infant (three to six months of age) has a rectal or ear temperature greater than 102 °F (38.9 °C); your child (six to 24 months of age) and has a temperature reading over 102 °F (38.9 °C) on any thermometer that lasts longer than a day.Most healthy adults can tolerate fevers as high as 103 – 104 °F (39 – 40 °C) for short periods of time without having problems. However, temperatures between 105.8 – 109.4 °F (41 – 43°C), termed hyperpyrexia, are serious and require medical attention. Temperatures above 109.4 °F (43 °C) are almost always fatal (deadly).

Your cardiologist will be able to counsel you on what the next steps should be and what tests they want you to undergo.If you don’t have a cardiologist, schedule an appointment with your primary care provider and they will give you a referral to a cardiologist if you need one.;
, You’ll need an appointment with a cardiologist or a hospital to get the monitor. Typically, a monitor is worn for 24 to 48 hours, but this timeframe can increase up to several weeks at your doctor’s discretion. Your doctor will prescribe the required time for you.Your doctor will generally want to do an Electrocardiogram (EKG) and an Echocardiogram before resorting the Holter monitor. The EKG and the Echo will give your cardiologist a reading of your heart’s activity in that moment. But your doctor may want a prolonged, more detailed reading.
Some common reasons people end up wearing a Holter monitor include suspecting they have an irregular arrhythmia or checking to see if various medication is working effectively.

, When you go to pick up your monitor for the first time, the tech may put it on for you. If they do, they will affix sticky patches to your skin that help get a more clear reading. If the tech only gives you the monitor, you will have to attach it yourself.

, The first step in attaching your Holter monitor is to clean your skin very well with soap and alcohol where the adhesive pads will attach to your body. Note that some of them have a gel to affix, and some of them have self-stick pads.If your monitor comes with cleansing wipes, use those to clean the area every time you put new sticky pads on.

, Put the adhesive pads on your body as directed — this usually means three pads on your chest and one near the bottom of your rib cage on the lower, left-hand side. Secure the electrical leads to the pads according to the instructions.Typically, the leads will snap into place on the adhesive pads, but you may have to use a sticky surgical tape instead.

, There are various types and brands of Holter monitors, so instructions for activating the device may vary; however, for most Holter monitors, you won’t need to do anything except make sure the battery is charged to maintain functionality.If the battery is charged, the machine automatically turns on.
Make sure you see the activity lights flashing on the monitor itself so you know that it is working properly.

, It is important to live your life normally while wearing the monitor so that your cardiologist can get a genuine representation of your heart activity in your normal life; however, you will not be permitted to get the monitor wet, which means you will have to remove it when you shower. Be sure to reattach the monitor as soon as you are done showering and have dried your body off.It is important to avoid all activities that would get the monitor wet while you’re wearing it. Don’t shower with the monitor, avoid sweaty exercises, don’t go swimming, etc.

, You will need to make sure the battery for the monitor remains charged. Your cardiologist will probably give you an extra battery so that you can always have a fully charged one that you swap out as needed. This way, you can always have one battery charging while the other is being used.


Typically, you will be given a battery charging port that the battery simply slips into to charge.
You will receive explicit instructions about charging the batteries from the technician at the cardiologist’s office before you leave.

, It is important to keep track of your cardiac symptoms while you are wearing the Holter monitor. Keep a journal or diary and write down notes about every abnormal cardiac event that you feel while wearing the monitor. This will give your doctor a more complete picture of what is going on with your cardiac health.Some monitors come with a separate phone-like device that allows you to “track” your symptoms. This means that you notify the monitoring company when you feel a symptom so that they know to pay special attention to what is happening on the monitor at that time.

, When the data measurement period is over, remove the pads and put the device back into its box/packaging. Your doctor may have a solvent to help making removal of the patches easier as they can often leave sticky marks on the skin for days after removal., The monitor is basically a rental from the doctor’s office; it is not yours to keep. You must return it to the cardiologist within a specified period of time. If you don’t return it, they will charge you for the equipment.You may have to physically go to the cardiologist’s office to return the monitor, or you may be able to simply mail it back to their office. It all depends on the cardiologist’s preference, but they will make it clear to you how they want you to return the device before you leave with it.

, Your cardiologist will read the results from your Holter monitor and discuss it with you at this appointment. They will let you know if there are any problems and what possible courses of treatment might be.The doctor will read the data from the machine and interpret it; they will then decide where to take your treatment from here.
Your cardiologist may take care of all this with a phone call instead of a follow-up appointment.

Buy your medical scale and ensure it is calibrated.,
See the tips below for the ""Buyer Beware"".,
Set the scale on a level firm surface - thin or low pile carpet and stiff linoleum is OK, as is concrete, non slip tiles (see warnings) and hardwood surfaces.,
Turn the scale on and when it comes to zero, step on.,
Record your weight in your diary or on an Excel spreadsheet where you can graph your data.,
Keep your scale checked once every two years, however it is recommended to check them annually.,
Look out for these errors which are can develop in all scales: (see tips for more info on these errors)


Zero point error - where the scale does not return to zero when you step off.,
Contact your local Scale service company if you need them repaired or calibrated.",How to Use a Medical Scale,"


A scale retailer is usually the only one who can guarantee this and they can be purchased online from a wide variety of retailers, but it is best to make sure they have the facilities to calibrate and service them.
Personal & medical scales should never be assumed as accurate at point of purchase as they invariably change in shipping from the factory and the stores.;
, If you have budget restrictions (as medical scales are more expensive due to their quality standards) and are not too worried about the accuracy, cheaper houseware types could be fine. If you are on a strict diet or need the scale for health control, medical quality may be essential. Your physician should advise you.

,


Do not put your scale in the bathroom, unlevel tiles gives false readings and humidity will affect the lifespan by corroding its hardware. Use your bedroom, home gym or wardrobe to keep your scales.
Slippery, smooth or highly polished surfaces may also be a slip hazard.
Thick carpet will absorb some of the mass unevenly so the scale can give inaccurate readings.

,


Mechanical naturally does not need turning on. Check regularly to ensure the batteries are still viable for digital scales as low power or fluctuating readings can affect the sensors and consequently the readings.

,


It is recommended to weigh yourself at the same time of day and to remove things that can affect your readings (shoes and excess clothing, wallets, car keys, cell phones, heavy jewellery etc all add to your weight). Your weight will also vary before and after meals and bowel movements and can vary as much as 2kg or 4.5lb a day.

, Some scale companies have a free for use scale you can check your weight on and then compare with your own. You can also check at your local clinic or hospital providing their scales are regularly calibrated.

, This is often when something is jammed inside, or the sensors have been damaged.
Linearity error - you notice your reading is OK, but your children or your heavier partner's weight is not OK. This is most common in low quality devices, but high quality ones can develop this over a long period without maintenance.
Repeatability error - no matter who steps on, they never get the same reading twice, but in the past it was reliable.

, Be aware that scale companies can fix certain medical types, but not houseware ones you buy at department stores. Some brands also have only specific service agents which should be taken into account at the point of purchase. Most errors are caused by shock, age, transport or rough handling.

Wrap the blood pressure cuff around your patient’s arm, right above the elbow.,
Press the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the brachial artery just below the cuff's edge.,
Inflate the cuff to 180mmHg or 30mm above your expected systolic blood pressure.You can find the reading by looking at the sphygmomanometer, which is the gauge on the blood pressure cuff.,
Listen for Korotkoff sounds.,
Release and remove the cuff.,
Wait a few minutes if you want to check the patient’s blood pressure again.",How to Use a Stethoscope7," Roll up your patient’s sleeve if it is in the way.Make sure that you use a blood pressure cuff that fits your patient’s arm. You should be able to wrap the cuff around your patient’s arm so that it is snug, but not too tight. If the blood pressure cuff is too small or too large, get a different size., You can also use the diaphragm if you have trouble hearing with the bell. You will be listening for Korotkoff sounds, which are low tone knocking sounds that indicate the patient’s systolic blood pressure.Find your pulse in your inner arm to help you determine where your brachial artery is located., Then, release air from the cuff at a moderate rate (3mm/sec). As yyou release the air, listen with the stethoscope and keep your eyes on the sphygmomanometer (gauge on the blood pressure cuff)., The first knocking sound that you hear is your patient’s systolic blood pressure. Note that number, but keep watching the sphygmomanometer. After the first sound stops, note the number that it stops on. That number is the diastolic pressure., Deflate and take the blood pressure cuff off of your patient right after you have gotten the second number.When you are done, you should have two numbers that make up your patient’s blood pressure. Record these numbers side by side, separated by a slash. For example, 110/70., You may want to re-measure if the patient’s blood pressure is high.A systolic blood pressure above 120 or a diastolic blood pressure above 80 indicates that your patient may have high blood pressure. In that case, your patient should seek further evaluation by a doctor.

In general, if your fist aid is coming with you on a camping excursion it should be big enough to stock adequate supplies for everyone in attendance but also lightweight and portable.If you're backpacking alone or with one or two other people, keep it on the smaller side as the less items in your backpack the better. Added weight can cause back strain and fatigue that can interfere with your journey.
If you're camping with a big group, family sized first aid kits are available online and at camping and department stores.
If you're using an RV or a car camper, you should consider investing in a car emergency kit, sold online or in camping stores, that includes car essentials like cable ties, bungee cords, and spark plugs in the event of an automobile emergency.;
, First aid kits come in all shapes and sizes, and are built from a variety of materials. While some people use their backpacks/totebags or cardboard boxes as first-aid kits, for camping you will need a waterproof container that seals shut. Go for materials like plastic, metal, and tin. Remember, size matters. Base what you use as a container on the number of fellow travelers and the length of your trip. If you're comfortable crafting a kit yourself, possible containers include:


Lunch boxes, food tins, tackle boxes, and other food storage containers, reusable or disposable. Very helpful are First Aid boxes from Stock of the Army Medical Corps. Newer versions are plastic-made and have a tightening gasket plus the Red Cross badge outside.
A zipper top clear plastic bag.
Clean plastic food containers., If you're not into DIY creations, purchase a first aid kit. Costs vary depending on size, whether the kit is stocked, and its material.


You can find first aid kits as many mass merchandise retailers, such as drug stores, grocery stores, discount stores, and convenience stores.
Speciality retailers, such as outdoor and camping stores, can provide first aid kits that are camping specific. The employees should also be able to answer any questions you have, so this would be a great option if you're new to camping.
First-aid kits are available online. However, you should avoid purchasing a first-aid kit online if you're unfamiliar with camping and do not know exactly what you're looking for., You need to be prepared for accidents while camping, and having supplies ready in the event of a wound or a burn is important. Get these items together for your kit:


Bandages, in assorted sizes and shapes. Make sure to include butterfly bandages, which will hold the edge of a deep cut together, and triangular bandages to create slings or hold dressings.
Blister pads
Gauze pads
Elastic bandages for wrapping sprains
Moleskin
Q-tips
Antiseptic wipes
Antibiotic cream , e.g. PVP Iodine solution and / or ointment.
Burn ointment
Rubbing alcohol, to clean tools such as tweezers in the event they are needed for an injury
Hydrogen Peroxide about 3 % as solution.
Some plastic vials with sterile NaCl 0,9% solution may be very helpful to rinse dirt away from the eyes or for cleaning a dirty wound as 1st step care.

, While on the trail, anything you need for your personal medical care should be packed in a first aid kit.Any prescription medications you or your fellow travelers use.
Over-the-counter pain management medication, like aspirin and ibuprofen.
Gastrointestinal meds, such as antacids and anti-diarrheal medication.
Antihistamines in the event of allergic reactions, e.g. Hydrocortisone Cream as OTC.
Topical antibiotic cream to treat small, shallow wounds.

, While camping, you will need a variety of tools to get through snares and wounds on the trail. In your fist aid kid, you should store:


Tweezers
Scissors
Magnifying glass
Safety pins
Duct tape
Needle with thread, in the event repairs are needed
Medical gloves, which are needed for handling unsanitary materials
Waterproof matches and fire starter
Water purification tablets, in the event you run out of water and need to use stream or lake water
Small-edge razor blade
Fingernail clippers
Flashlight
A variety of batteries
Emergency blanket, which is an aluminum style reflective blanket to have on hand if temperatures drop dangerously low or if you get wet, Depending on weather and other conditions, you may need some of the following creams and sprays on your trip:.


Anti-itch creams or sprays, particularly those that help relieve itching and pain from bug bites and contact with poisonous plants
Burn relief sprays
Petroleum jelly for chafing
Lip balm
Sunscreen

, These additions are optional, and depend whether you need them for your personal care.:


Epi-pen, if you suffer from severe allergic reactions.
Multivitamins, if you have a special diet plan.
Snake-bite kit if you're hiking in an area where snakes are present.
Dog boots, if you're hiking with a dog. These can protect their feet on harsh terrain.
Baby wipes, if you have a small child.
Anti-chafing of ant-friction cream, if you're hiking in humid environments.

, Depending on what the weather will be during your camping trip, special supplies might be needed. Make sure to check the forecast before setting out.


If you're camping in hot or humid conditions, bring waterproof sunscreen and lip balm that is at least SPF 15, coolers for drinks and food, and clothing made from light fabrics like nylon and polyester.If you're camping somewhere cold, bring chapstick and moisturizer as winter can lead to dry, irritated skin., Group items together based on their usability. That is, keep your medical supplies in one section, your burn wound and care supplies in another, and so on. If you bought your first aid kit online or from a retailer, they should have separate sections built in. If not, you can glue in cardboard or plastic as a barrier or keep items in small plastic bags together. Organization is important as, in the event of an emergency, you should be able to locate needed items fast.

, Some times in your first aid kit need to be sealed in plastic bags before being stored. Make sure you know what to bag.


Anything with a strong scent, like lotion and some antifungal creams, should be bagged to mask the smell and deter predators.
If you're camping at a faraway location and taking your first aid kit on a plane, you'll need travel sized versions of liquids, gels, and creams. For carry-on, all liquids must be in containers of 3.4 ounces or less and these bottles must all be placed together in a ziplock plastic bag. This bag can be no more than one quart in size., The night before you leave for your camping trip, make sure all items in the fist aid kit are stores and ready. Make sure medications are not expired, batteries are in working order, tweezers and other tools are sharp and ready."

Recognize the symptoms of a heart attack.A heart attack occurs when the arteries that feed blood to your heart get clogged, blocking off blood flow.,
Seek immediate emergency attention.Either call emergency services or ask someone to take you to the emergency room.,
Take aspirin if you're not allergic.Most blockages that lead to heart attack are the result of clot-causing platelets (blood cells) that are attracted to a plaque buildup from cholesterol.,
Get as comfortable as possible.You don't want to move around or do anything to get your blood pumping, as this could cause further damage to the heart.",How to Ease Sudden Chest Pain1," This damages the heart and causes the chest pain associated with a heart attack. The chest pain experienced during a heart attack can be described as dull, achy, squeezing, tight, or like a heavy pressure. It focuses around the center of the chest. To make sure you're having a heart attack, look for its other symptoms:


Shortness of breath
Nausea or vomiting
Light-headedness or dizziness
Cold sweats
Pain in the left arm, jaw, and neck.;
, The faster the doctors can clear the blockage, the less damage it can do to the heart.

, Even a small amount of aspirin will suppress the presence of platelets in your blood, thinning both blood and clots.


Studies show that chewing the aspirin tablet is more effective at treating the clot, easing the chest pain, and preventing damage than swallowing it.
Slowly chew on a 325 mg tablet of aspirin while waiting to receive emergency attention.
Get the aspirin into your system as soon as possible.

, Sit down in a comfortable position and do your best to stay calm. Loosen or remove any restrictive clothing, and try to relax as best you can.

One good option is a large, translucent, water-resistant, rigid or flexible plastic container with either a zipper closure or a latch-top lid. This makes the materials inside visible for easy identification.
For a larger first aid kit with more items inside, a backpack or small duffel bag can suffice
Lunchboxes are also another good option. Basically, if it is roomy, easily-accessible, portable, and at least somewhat water resistant, it can make a decent first aid kit container.
It should be easy to transport as needed to the emergency, so a handle is ideal.
You'll also want to be able to separate items by type within the kit so you can find them easily. Labeled zip-close bags are a good option for a non-rigid container especially. For a lunchbox or other rigid container, look for smaller, clear plastic containers like those available for crafting supplies, or even disposable food storage containers with snap-on lids.
Regardless of your container choice, clearly identify it — for instance, by writing “FIRST AID” with a permanent marker in multiple locations.;
, When your child is crying about a ""boo-boo"" on her knee, you don't want your home kit buried on the back of a closet or lost because it's not being returned to the same spot after each use.


Establish a clearly-defined, consistent spot for your first aid kit, on a visible / accessible linen closet shelf, for instance, and inform everyone in your home of its location.
Let small children know where the kit is located, but place it where they cannot access it.

, Make sure everyone in your home who is old enough to understand the function of a first aid kit knows its location and when to retrieve it.For younger children who shouldn’t yet try to use the items in the kit, teach them where it is located, so they could show a visitor, relative, babysitter, etc. But place the kit in a location where small children can not access it, such as on a high shelf.
For older children and adults, instruct them on when to retrieve the kit and how to use the various items in it. Use a first aid instruction booklet, like those available from the American Red Cross,for guidance and place a booklet in the kit for reference.

, No one wants to fetch a first aid kit and find the bandage box empty or the pain relievers expired. Keep track of supply amounts and expiration dates regularly.


You’ve probably heard that you should check / replace the batteries in your smoke detectors when Daylight Saving Time begins and ends in the Spring and Fall.This would also be a good opportunity to check the status of your first aid kit and restock it as needed.

, Drawing from the suggestions made in Part 2 of this article, stock your first aid kit and record every item on a sheet of paper you can keep it in the kit.


Record amounts (10 small bandages, for example) and expiration dates (for medications or ointments) next to the listed items on the checklist you include in your kit.
You want anyone who retrieves the kit to immediately know what it includes and does not include, and that items are ready-to-use.

, One of the essentials when dealing with minor cuts and scrapes, is a variety of sizes and types of bandaging materials. Having multiple options from which to choose will make your first aid efforts simpler.Place all your bandages in a clear, zip-close bag clearly labeled in permanent marker. Include:

25 adhesive bandages of various sizes
Five 3” x 3” and five 4” x 4” gauze pads
A roll of cloth adhesive tape
Two 5” x 9” sterile dressings
One 3” wide and one 4” wide roller bandage (ace bandage)
Two triangular bandages



, Be ready for plucking splinters, cutting bandages, and other first aid activities without having to rummage through the junk drawer. Place these in a marked zip-close bag as well. Definitely include:Small, sharp scissors
Tweezers
Two pairs of non-latex gloves
Non-mercury oral thermometer
Cotton balls and swabs
CPR breathing barrier mask
Instant cold compress
First aid instruction booklet
Hand sanitizer
Cleansing wipes (for external cleaning only)
Zip-close plastic bags (to dispose of medical waste)

, If you have a roomy kit, think about adding non-essential but useful medical tools in an additional, marked bag. These might include:Eye protection
Prepackaged space (warming) blanket
Aluminum finger splint
Duct tape
Petroleum jelly
Sewing needle
Safety pins
Turkey baster (for flushing out wounds)

, Keep these separate from bandages and tools, and clearly marked. Check expiration dates regularly. You should be able to find travel / trial / first aid kit sized packs of most of the following:Aloe vera gel
Calamine lotion
Anti-diarrheal medication
Laxatives
Antacids
Antihistamines
Pain relievers (aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen)
Hydrocortisone cream
Cough / cold medicine

, Consider including small doses of prescription medications for each member of your family, especially in car / travel kits, in small, clearly marked containers with instructions for each.Keep close track of prescription medication expiration dates.
If anyone in your family has severe allergies and a prescription for an epi-pen, keep one in the home kit with instructions, so a visitor could provide assistance in an emergency.
Even for home kits, keeping a small stock of personalized medical supplies — a bee sting kit, for example — can prove useful if your medicine cabinet supply happens to be depleted.

, You should always have a first aid kit in your home, and you should always have one in each car you own. Some cars come with their own first aid kit, but it should be checked and supplemented so it is complete.


A travel kit should be similar to the home version, but to make it ready for the road, consider adding items such as: a flashlight with batteries; waterproof matches; a solar/crank charger for phones; sunscreen, insect repellant; a whistle; phone numbers for your physician, poison control, etc.; and medical consent and history forms for each family member.Make your car kit accessible as well; don't bury it in the spare tire well under your trunk floor.
See also How To Pack a First Aid Kit for Your Car for more ideas.

, See How to Make a First Aid Kit for Camping for more ideas.


A camping kit will be similar to a car kit, but be extra sure to have a good pair of scissors; waterproof matches; a space blanket; duct tape; a solar/crank phone charger; and a whistle.
Include water purification tablets as well, to protect yourself should you need to drink from a body of water.

, It's nice to have a sizable kit with a bit of everything, but a smaller, easily portable kit can be with you nearly all the time.


For help in maximizing your first aid kit while minimizing its size, see How to Make a Compact First Aid Kit.
One commercially-available purse kit winnows down the contents to one ointment packet, three cleansing wipes, two gauze pads, and 10 bandages.Adding small amounts of your most commonly-used medications to a small zip-close bag would make for a solid first aid kit that should fit nicely in a purse, diaper bag, backpack, etc.

, If anyone in your family has special medical needs, prepare travel kits that are clearly marked and specifically designed to treat his or her needs.


An allergy emergency kit is probably the most common example. Visit How to Create an Allergy Emergency Kit for more information.
For such a kit, use a small, durable, water-resistant container, clearly marked with ""ALLERGY EMERGENCY KIT"" along with the person's name.
Work with your doctor to determine what medications should be included. Antihistamines (such as Benadryl), Prednisone, and/or epi-pens are the most likely inclusions.
Include two or more doses of any medications, in case of a delay in medical intervention.
On a durable, possibly laminated, piece of paper or notecard, clearly write/print out all instructions for how and when to use the medications. Also include the physician's phone number and any important patient information (any additional allergies, for instance).

Learn the symptoms of pericarditis.Pericarditis occurs when the pericardium (a membrane around the heart) is swollen or irritated, usually from viral infection.,
Seek immediate medical attention.,
Ease the pain by sitting up and leaning forward.The pericardium has two layers of tissue that rub together when inflamed, causing the chest pain.,
Take aspirin or ibuprofen.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Ease Sudden Chest Pain2," The resulting chest pain usually feels like a sharp, stabbing pain in either the center or the left side of your chest. In some patients, though, the pain is more of a dull pressure that spreads to the jaw and/or left arm. This pain can worsen with breathing or movement. Some of the symptoms of pericarditis look a lot like those of a heart attack:


Shortness of breath
Heart palpitations
Low-grade fever
Fatigue or nausea
Cough
Swollen legs or abdomen

, Though pericarditis is often mild and resolves on its own, it's difficult to distinguish between its symptoms and those of a heart attack.It can also develop into more severe cases that can require surgery to relieve the symptoms. You need immediate supervision and diagnostic tests to find out what's actually causing the pain.


Call emergency services or ask someone to take you to the nearest emergency room.
Just like with heart attacks, early treatment is the best way to prevent the condition from worsening.

, By sitting in this position, you can reduce the tissue friction and its resulting pain while waiting for medical attention.

, Taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug like aspirin or ibuprofen will reduce the tissue inflammation. This, in turn, reduces the friction between the two layers of the pericardium and eases your chest pain.


Consult your doctor before taking these medications.
With physician approval, take these medications three times a day with food. You should take a total of two to four grams of Aspirin per day or 1200 to 1800 mg of ibuprofen per day., Pericarditis is usually the result of a viral infection. You can treat it like the common cold to speed up your recover and eliminate the pain quickly. Rest and sleep will help your immune system function more efficiently, speeding up the healing process."

Recognize the severity of lung conditions.,
Look for the symptoms of pneumonia.Pneumonia is an infection that affects the air sacs in the lungs.,
See a doctor if your pneumonia symptoms grow severe.,
Ask your doctor for medication.If a bacterial infection has caused the pneumonia, the doctor can prescribe antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin) to fight the infection and speed up recovery.,
Watch for the symptoms of pulmonary embolism and pneumothorax.A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blockage develops in a lung (pulmonary) artery.,
Seek immediate medical attention for pulmonary embolism and pneumothorax.",How to Ease Sudden Chest Pain3," If your legs are swollen or you have been sitting for a long time as in a overseas plane ride, blood clots can form and spread to your lung arteries, causing blockage. Lung conditions cause chest pain that can worsen when you breathe, move, or cough.


Get to an emergency room as quickly as possible.
Lung conditions may require emergency surgery to alleviate symptoms.

, They become inflamed, and can fill with fluid, which results in the phlegm and mucus you see when you cough. The chest pain you experience may be accompanied by:


Fever
Coughing up mucus or phlegm
Fatigue
Nausea, and vomiting

, In mild cases, you can simply rest at home and wait for your immune system to fight off the infection. But if the infection grows severe it can become life-threatening, especially in children and the elderly. See your doctor if:


You have trouble breathing
The chest pain worsens significantly
You have a fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher that won't go down
Your coughing won't subside, especially if you're coughing up pus
Be especially careful with children under two, adults over 65, and anyone else with a compromised immune system.

, However, even if antibiotic treatment is not an option for your infection, he can still give you medication to deal with the chest pain or reduce the coughing that worsens the pain.

, Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) occurs when air leaks into the space between your lungs and your chest wall. Both conditions cause severe shortness of breath or a bluish discoloration of the fingers and mouth.


In delicate patients such as the elderly or long-term asthma sufferers, the intense coughing from pneumonia can sometimes cause a lung blockage or tear in the lung.

, If you suspect a pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax, then seek immediate medical attention. In addition to chest pain, both conditions cause severe shortness of breath or a bluish discoloration of the fingers and mouth.


Both conditions require immediate medical attention. The blood leaking into the chest cavity or the air escaping into it can rapidly collect and compress your lungs. These conditions will not resolve on their own, but require medical assistance. Call emergency services or get to an emergency room as quickly as possible.

Make sure you have acid reflux.Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid irritates the connection between the stomach and esophagus, causing it to relax.,
Sit up or stand.When you feel that familiar burning sensation, avoid lying down.,
Take an antacid.Tums, Maalox, Pepto-Bismol, and Mylanta are all over the counter antacids that can relieve heartburn symptoms quickly.,
Think about taking medication to reduce acid production.While antacids prevent reflux, Prilosec and Zantac work to stop acid production in the stomach.,
Make a simple, homemade treatment.,
Try herbal treatment.,
Consider acupuncture treatment.,
Ask a doctor for prescription strength medication if necessary.If you find that over the counter treatments and home remedies aren't doing the trick, you may need prescription strength help.",How to Ease Sudden Chest Pain4," This then causes the acid to rise from the stomach into the esophagus, resulting in a burning pain in the chest. People with acid reflux may also experience nausea or a feeling like food is stuck in the chest or throat. It sometimes leaves an acidic taste in the mouth.


The condition is usually triggered or worsened by fatty or spicy meals, especially if you lay down after eating.
Alcohol, chocolate, red wine, tomatoes, citrus fruits, peppermint, caffeinated products and coffee can cause acid build up and reflux.

, Acid reflux happens in the esophagus, and lying down encourages stomach acid to flow through it. Sit up to help keep the acid from easily entering the esophagus.


You can also try doing some gentle movement, such as rocking in a chair or walking. This may help to improve your digestion.

, Take these drugs either after meals or after you begin feeling symptoms. You can also find antacids that can be taken before meals to prevent heartburn altogether. Read the instructions on the labels carefully, and take the drugs as directed.

,


Prilosec is an over the counter proton pump inhibitor that stops acid production in your stomach. Take 1 tablet at least an hour before your meals to slow down acid reflux. Make sure that you read the insert carefully to ensure you understand how this medication will affect your overall digestion.
Zantac works achieves the same effect by blocking receptors for Histamine. Place a tablet in a glass of water and wait for it to dissolve. Drink the mixture 30 to 60 mins before your meal to reduce acid production.

, A mixture of baking soda and water is also known as ""sodium bicarbonate,"" and can be very useful in easing acid reflux pain.Simply mix 1 or 2 tablespoons of baking soda into a glass of water and drink it when you feel chest pain from acid reflux. The bicarbonate found in baking soda will help neutralize the acid.

, Make a cup of chamomile or ginger tea, or add ginger root to your meals. These two herbs can help with digestion, and have a soothing effect on your stomach.


DGL-licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) extract can help coat the mucous lining of the esophagus and prevent the damage and pain of acid reflux.Take 250 to 500 mg capsules three times daily, chewed either one hour before or two hours after meals.If you take this for a prolonged period, visit your doctor to have him check your potassium levels. Licorice can reduce the potassium content in your body, which in turn can cause heart palpitations and arrhythmias.
Buy deglycyrrhizinated capsules to prevent side effects such as swelling.

, Several studies suggest acupuncture can have a positive effect in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. In a 6 week study, acid reflux patients were given traditional Chinese acupuncture at 4 specific points on the body. The acupuncture group had results similar to the group treated with traditional medication. Tell the acupuncturist to focus on the following areas once a day for a week:Zhongwan (CV 12)
Bilateral Zusanli (ST36)
Sanyinjiao (SP6)
Neiguan (PC6)

, The OTC medication Prilosec is also produced in prescription strength, and may be able to help ease your pain.


Be sure to follow the medication insert’s advisements on changes you may experience in digestion.

Learn what a panic or anxiety attack is.,
Breath deeply and slowly.,
Use relaxation techniques.,
Schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist.If the panic attacks begin to interfere with your life, and relaxation techniques have not worked, you may need professional help.",How to Ease Sudden Chest Pain5," These attacks are largely triggered by feelings of restlessness, nervousness, fear, or stress. To prevent attacks from recurring, patients should get behavioral therapy and possibly psychiatric medication. Highly emotional states can increase your breathing rate, straining the chest muscles to the point of pain. They can also make the esophagus or the coronary (heart) arteries spasm, which you would feel in your chest.In addition to chest pain, you may experience:


Increased breathing
Increased heart rate
Shaking
Heart palpitations (feeling that your heart is jumping out of your chest)

, Hyperventilation can cause spasms in the chest muscles, arteries and esophagus. Slow, deep breathing reduces the respiratory rate, decreasing your chance of painful spasms.


Count to three in your head on each inhalation and each exhalation.
Controlled your breathing instead of letting air rush in and out of your body. By controlling your breath, you can take control of your anxiety or panic.If you have to, use a breath volume limiting device like a paper lunch bag held to your mouth and nose to limit the amount of air your body takes in. This can cut off the cycle of hyperventilation.

, A recent study suggests massage therapy, thermotherapy, and relaxing room therapy are effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder.After a 12-week course of these relaxation techniques, the subjects showed a reduction in the symptoms of anxiety and depression.


Schedule a 35-minute massage that focuses on indirect myofascial release (trigger points). Also ask the massage therapist to focus on muscle restrictions in the shoulder, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, the neck and back of head, and the bony area on top of the buttocks.
Find a comfortable position on the massage table, using blankets or towels to make any adjustments you need.
Play music that makes you relax, and take slow, deep breaths.Ask the massage therapist to use Swedish massage techniques between muscle groups to transition between them.
Ask the the massage therapist to place warm towels or heating pads on your muscles. When he or she transitions between muscle groups, remove the heat to experience cold transitions between groups.
Take slow deep breaths during the session.

, See a psychiatrist to talk about the possible causes of your anxiety. A steady routine of 1-on-1 therapy is the best way to ease your symptoms.


Therapists sometimes prescribe benzodiazepines or antidepressants to people who experience panic attacks. These medications treat the symptoms during an attack and prevent you from having future ones.

Look for symptoms of a fever.,
Consider the age, health condition, and behavior of the child or elderly person.",How to Use a Rectal Thermometer1," Keep in mind that young children and infants may not exhibit these symptoms. Fever symptoms include:


Sweating and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
General weakness
Hallucinations, confusion, irritability, convulsions, and dehydration may be present with high fevers.;
, For babies younger than 3 months, taking the temperature rectally is most recommended. This is because their ear canals are too small to use an electronic ear thermometer in them.For kids between three months and four years, you can use either an electronic ear thermometer to take the temperature in the ear canal, or use a rectal thermometer to take the temperature rectally. You can also use any digital thermometer to take an underarm (axillary) temperature, though this is less accurate.
For kids older than age 4 who are able to cooperate, you can use a digital thermometer to take the temperature orally. You will need to consider, however, if they must breathe through their mouths due to stuffy noses, because this can cause an inaccurate temperature reading. If this is the case, then you can also use an electronic ear thermometer, temporal artery thermometer, or use the digital thermometer to get an underarm (axillary) temperature.
Similarly, for elderly adults, you’ll need to consider any uncooperative behavior or medical conditions that could interfere with obtaining a temperature reading to determine which method you should use.If getting a rectal or oral temperature reading is impractical, then the tympanic method (using an electronic ear thermometer) or temporal method may be used.

Be able to distinguish costochondritis and musculoskeletal pain.The ribs are connected to the sternum through the cartilage in the ""chondrosternal"" joint.,
Take over the counter pain medication.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen will ease the pain from cartilage and muscular chest pain.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Stretch beforehand if you exercise.If you don't adequately stretch your muscles before strenuous activity, you will feel tightness and pain in them after you stop.,
Use a heating pad.Heat can be an effective therapy for ongoing muscle or joint issues, and can ease this type of chest pain.Place the heat pad in the microwave and heat as described in the directions.,
Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if symptoms continue.",How to Ease Sudden Chest Pain6," When that cartilage gets inflamed — usually from strenuous activity — you can feel chest pain from costochondritis. Exercise may also strain chest muscles, leading to musculoskeletal pain that feels like costochondritis. The pain can be sharp, aching, or feel like pressure on the chest. You usually will feel it only when you move or breathe. However, these two causes of chest pain are the only ones that can be reproduced by putting pressure on the area with your hand.


To tell the difference between musculoskeletal and cartilage joint pain, press on the the ribs around the sternum (bone in center of your chest).
If there's pain next to the sternum, chances are you have costochondritis.

, These drugs suppress the inflammation process — whether in the cartilage or the muscles — reducing the conditions that cause pain.


Take 2 pills or tablets with water and food. The food helps prevent irritation of the stomach.

, The pain from these conditions is self-limiting, meaning that it will go away with time instead of lingering.However, you need to rest your strained muscles and your rib joints to give the damaged tissue a chance to heal. If you don't want to stop exercising completely, at least reduce the exercises that put stress on the chest area.

, This is the last thing you want when you're experiencing cartilage or muscle pain. Before beginning your exercise sessions, make sure to stretch the muscle groups in the chest:


Lift your arms straight over your head, then stretch as far to the back and sides as you can. Really let your chest muscles expand and relax as you do this.
While facing a corner, stretch your arms out fully and place one hand on each wall. Move your hands further apart from each other, letting your chest come closer to the wall in the process.
With your feet planted on the ground, get a firm hold of the sides of an open door. Lunge your chest forward, holding your body up by your grip on the doorframe. You can also simply walk forward while holding onto the doorframe.

, Place it over the painful areas intermittently so you don't burn yourself. The heat will loosen the tension in your muscles and promote healing. You can also massage the area after applying heat with the pads of your fingers to further loosen the muscles.Taking a warm bath with a cup of Epsom's salts in the water can also ease the pain in your cartilage and muscles.

, If you're continuously straining your chest muscles, don't expect the pain to go away quickly. However, if the pain lingers even with plenty of rest, you should schedule an appointment with your doctor.


Seek immediate attention if you were in an accident involving chest trauma. A broken rib can damage the lungs and heart if left untreated. Your doctor may perform an x-ray to note any broken bones.

Purchase a digital rectal thermometer.,
Be sure that the baby or patient has not had a bath or been swaddled (when babies are wrapped tightly for warmth) in the past 20 minutes.,
Clean the tip of the rectal thermometer with soapy water or rubbing alcohol.,
Apply petroleum jelly to the tip of the thermometer to make it easier to insert.,
Lay your baby on his back and insert the digital thermometer into the rectum.",How to Use a Rectal Thermometer2," These types of thermometers are available at pharmacies. Make sure that the digital thermometer you buy is labeled for rectal use. If you plan to use a digital thermometer for both oral and rectal temperatures, then buy two and label them accordingly.Also, never use a mercury thermometer, which is the glass kind that used to be used.Rectal thermometers have a security bulb specifically designed for safely taking rectal temperatures.Review usage of your specific thermometer. Familiarization of the thermometer will aid in preventing prolonged insertion into rectum. Follow and keep the manufacturer's instructions for correct use to ensure safety and accuracy.

, This can cause an inaccurate reading., Never use the same thermometer that you use in the rectum to take temperatures in other ways, because this can spread bacteria., If you prefer to use a disposable thermometer sleeve, use one of these instead and always dispose of after use and use a new one each time. But, be careful with the sleeves. They may pull off the thermometer as you are taking the temperature. You will need to hold it as you pull the thermometer out when you’re finished.

, Only insert it about ½ to 1 inch and do not force it in if there is resistance. Keep the thermometer in the baby’s rectum until it indicates that it is finished. Then, remove the thermometer and check the reading.Turn the thermometer on.

Use one hand to gently separate the buttocks with the thumb and forefinger, so you can see the rectum.,
Hold the thermometer in place with one hand on the buttocks.,
Remove the thermometer carefully when the thermometer beeps or signals.,
Clean the thermometer thoroughly before storing it.",How to Use a Rectal Thermometer3," With your other hand, carefully insert the thermometer into the rectum, only one-half to one inch.1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm).


The thermometer should be pointed toward the person’s belly button.
Stop if you feel any resistance.

, Use the other hand to comfort the patient and prevent them from moving around. It is important the patient remain still while the thermometer is inserted so they don't get hurt during the procedure.


If the patient moves around too much, it may cause an inaccurate reading or injury to the rectum.
Never leave a baby or an older patient unattended with a thermometer inside the rectum., Read the temperature and record it. Temperatures taken rectally generally read as 0.5 - 1 degree F (0.3-0.6 C) higher than temperatures taken orally.As you remove the thermometer, be sure the disposable sleeve is removed from the patient's rectum, if you used one on the thermometer.

, Use soapy water or apply rubbing alcohol to the thermometer. Dry it and store it in its packaging so it is ready to use next time, and make sure to mark it for rectal use only.

Call the doctor of a baby under 3 months old immediately if the rectal temperature is 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher, even if there is no other sign of illness.,
Call the doctor for a high temp with or without other symptoms.,
Watch for other situations when you need to contact a doctor.,
Watch for a lower than normal temperature in a newborn.,
Contact the doctor of a person of ages 2 and up who has any fever without any other illness symptoms (cold symptoms, diarrhea, etc.),
Seek emergency medical attention for a child in certain situations.,
Seek emergency medical attention for an adult if certain symptoms are present.",How to Use a Rectal Thermometer4," This is very important. Young babies have limited ability to fight illness because their immune system isn’t fully developed. They are more prone to some serious bacterial infections such as kidney and blood stream infections, and pneumonia.If the baby has a fever on the weekend or evening after office hours, go to the emergency room.

, Contact the doctor of a 3-6 month old baby with a temperature up to 102 degrees F (38.9C) and who seems unusually lethargic, irritable, or uncomfortable, OR calla doctor if the temperature is over 102F (38.9C) with or without any symptoms.For a child 6 to 24 months, call a doctor if the baby’s temperature is over 102F (38.9C) and lasts more than one day with no symptoms. If the child has symptoms such as cough, diarrhea, cold, you may want to consider calling sooner depending on the severity of the symptoms., There are certain other situations when you may need to contact a doctor. This will depend on the age of the person and the symptoms they are having.


For a child over age 2, call a doctor for a fever up to 102F (38.9C) with vague symptoms (lethargy, restlessness, seems uncomfortable. Also, call a doctor for a temperature over 102F that lasts longer than 3 days and is not responding to medication.For adults, contact a doctor for a fever that is not responding to medication, is 103F (39.4C) or over, or that lasts over 3 days., If a newborn has a lower than normal temperature, which would be lower than 97F (36.1C), then you should call your doctor right away. Young infants may not regulate their temperature well when ill., for 3 days, or is accompanied by the following conditions:a sore throat for more than 24 hours
shows signs of dehydration (dry mouth, less than one wet diaper in 8 hours or urinating less frequently)
pain when urinating
refuses to eat, has a rash, or has difficulty breathing, or
has recently returned from a trip in another country.

, In some situations, you may need to seek emergency medical attention for a child with a fever. If a child develops a fever after being left in a hot car or another potentially dangerous situation, seek emergency medical attention if you notice that the child has:A fever and is not sweating.
A severe headache
Confusion
Ongoing vomiting or diarrhea
Seizures
A stiff neck
Irritability or noticeable discomfort
Any other unusual symptoms.

, Adults may also require emergency medical attention in some situations. Seek emergency medical attention for an adult if they have a fever and you also notice:They are complaining about a severe headache.
They have severe throat swelling.
An unusual skin rash, especially one that becomes worse quickly.
They complain about a stiff neck and have pain when they bend their head forward.
They are unusually sensitive to bright lights.
They seem confused.
They are coughing persistently.
They are complaining about muscle weakness or sensory changes.
They have a seizure.
They seem to be having trouble breathing or complain of chest pain.
They seem extremely irritable or listless.
They have abdominal pain when they urinate.
You notice any other unexplained symptoms.

Understand the importance of emergencies: preparedness and response.,
Take into consideration what could possibly happen where you live.,
Educate yourself and your family about what to do in various situations.

",How to Educate Others on the Importance of Emergencies: Preparedness and Response," In order to spread the message, it is important to know the facts. The basics are:


In emergencies, children have the same rights as in non-emergency situations. This is true whether the emergency is a conflict, disaster or epidemic.
Girls and boys and their families and communities should plan ahead and take simple steps to prepare for emergencies – at home, at school and in the community.
Measles, diarrhoea, pneumonia, malaria, malnutrition and neonatal complications are major causes of child deaths, particularly during emergencies.
An epidemic (or outbreak) of disease can cause an emergency because of the severity of the disease or responses to it. In the case of pandemic influenza and other diseases spread by close personal contact, those who are ill should be kept separated from others.
Mothers, even malnourished mothers, can still breastfeed even under the stressful conditions of emergencies.
Children have the right to be protected from violence in emergencies. Governments, civil society, international organizations, communities and families have the responsibility to protect them.
It is generally preferable for children to be cared for by their parents or other usual caregivers because it makes children feel more secure. If separation occurs, every effort should be made to reunite the child with his or her family, if it is in the child's best interest.
The disruption and stress caused by disasters and armed conflict can frighten and anger children. When such events occur, children need special attention and extra affection. They should be kept as safe as possible and supported in resuming normal activities. Children can be given age-appropriate opportunities to participate in the responses to and decisions regarding the emergency situation.
Children have the right to education, even during emergencies. Having children attend a safe, child-friendly school helps to reinforce their sense of normalcy and start the process of healing.
Landmines and unexploded devices are extremely dangerous. They can explode and kill or disable many people if touched, stepped on or disturbed in any way. Children and their families should stay only in areas that have been declared safe and avoid unknown objects.;
, If you live in the US Midwest, you are unlikely to come across land mines, but you would probably want to prepare for tornadoes or floods.

Call emergency services.,
Protect yourself.,
Check for entry and exit wounds.,
Expose the wound.,
Cut a dressing from airtight material.,
Ask the person to exhale.,
Place the plastic over the wound.,
Wrap a dressing around the chest.,
Leave any protruding objects.,
Position the victim on their side.,
Look out for signs of a tension pneumothorax.,
Look for signs of subcutaneous emphysema.,
Remove the seal, if necessary.,
Help minimize shock.",How to Dress a Chest Wound," Getting immediate professional care for the patient is crucial. It can mean the difference between life and death. Before you take steps to dress the wound yourself, call for emergency medical personnel if possible.In many places where cell phone service is not available, it is still possible to call emergency services.
If you cannot personally make the phone call for any reason, designate another specific person to make the call.
If you know what to do for the wound and there is someone else around, have them call the emergency services while you work on the wound.;
, There are universal precautions that you should take before dealing with an injured person. These are for your protection and theirs. Make sure to be safe even as you work to prevent more serious harm to the victim.Wash your hands with soap and water.
Wear gloves, if available. If they are unavailable, you can use shopping bags or bread bags.Wear a face mask and eye protection if possible.
Dispose of anything contaminated with blood or bodily fluids in a safe way.

, If there are both exit and entry wounds, both of them will need to be dressed. The wounds may not be obvious, depending on what the victim is wearing, so be sure to look underneath their clothes and on their back.If there is more than one wound or opening, you should first handle a wound that is gaping and uncovered. Using a cloth or a piece of clothing or plastic, cover the entire wound, as well as two inches past its edge. If you can hear air passing through the chest cavity or see blood bubbling, tape two or three sides of the cloth down. This will stop air from building up in the chest.After you deal with a gaping wound, you should look for wounds where you can stop the bleeding, if applicable. A gaping chest wound should be your first priority, but, after that, you should work to stop bleeding, wherever it may be.A chest wound is often characterized by bleeding, frothy blood, shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing.
The chest may not rise normally when the person inhales.

, The wound should be immediately exposed by removing clothing and any other objects from the area. Cut the clothes off if they are covering the wound, but if clothing is stuck to the wound, don’t try to remove it, as it could cause more pain or injury.Do not attempt to clean the wound.
If you’re in a chemical environment, do everything you can to prevent exposing the wound and the first aid provider to the chemicals.

, Sterile plastic is the ideal thing to create a dressing out of. However, depending on your circumstances, you may not have access to this. Use the best thing immediately available to you.The plastic packaging for a sterile bandage can be a good makeshift dressing.
A clean ziploc bag works well.
If the wound is small, a credit card can sometimes be used when there is nothing else available.
If clean plastic is not available, you can try using a folded piece of clean fabric.
If you have absolutely nothing else you can use, you can use your own hand, which should be protected with a glove, as a last resort.

, If the person is able to, they should exhale and hold it, so that their chest cavity is flat while you place the plastic. This helps force some of the air out of the wound.Forcing air out before sealing the wound will allow the person to breathe more easily after the wound is sealed.
If the person is unconscious or can’t hold their breath for any reason, place the plastic on the wound after their chest falls and before it rises.

, Make sure that the plastic dressing extends at least 2 inches (or 5cm) beyond the wound edges. This prevents the dressing from being sucked back into the wound. The dressing should be taped down on three sides.It’s best to tape the top and sides of the dressing and leave the bottom open.Leaving one side open allows for air to escape when the person exhales.
Sterile medical tape is ideal, but use whatever you have available.
If no kind of tape is available, you or the victim will need to hold the plastic in place until the chest can be bandaged.

, If you have a field dressing available, wrap one tail under and around the victim. Wrap the other tail around them in the opposite direction and bring it back over the dressing. Tighten the two tails and tie them with a nonslip knot over the center of the dressing.The knot will provide additional pressure over the wound and will help to keep the seal airtight.
The dressing should not interfere with breathing.
Keep pressure on the plastic as you apply the dressing so that the plastic doesn’t slip off the wound.
If you don’t have a proper field dressing, you can use a sheet or long piece of fabric instead.

, If an object is protruding from the wound, don’t try to remove it. The plastic dressing should help form an almost airtight seal around it.Stabilize the object by placing a heavy dressing around it. This dressing should be made from the cleanest material available.
When applying bandages, don’t wrap the bandages around the protruding object.
When tying a knot in a bandage, tie the knot beside the object, not on it.
Trying to remove the object can cause life-threatening bleeding, so an impaled object should only be removed at the hospital, in an operating room, where bleeding can be controlled.

, If possible, have the victim lie down on their side, with the injured side of their body toward the ground. If this makes it difficult to breathe, they can sit up instead.If sitting up, the victim should rest against a tree or wall.
If the victim becomes tired of sitting up, have them lie back down on their side.

, A tension pneumothorax is a collapsed lung that has leaked lots of air between the chest wall and the lung. This is often deadly and must be avoided.Signs of a tension pneumothorax include:Severe shortness of breath
Unequal chest (one side looks bigger than the other)
Veins on the neck bulging (jugular vein distension)
Blue lips, neck or fingers (cyanosis)
No lung sounds on one side

, This can be an early sign of pneumothorax, too. If the patient has a ""crackling"" sensation on their chest, face, or neck (and rarely the abdomen). This condition, also called crepitus, is not necessarily dangerous, but it often associated with pneumothorax., If you suspect a tension pneumothorax is building, immediately take off the seal to allow the air to escape. This will help relieve pressure and can save the victim’s life!, Until the victim can be taken to a medical facility, do what you can to minimize shock. If a person is severely wounded, chances are they have already gone into shock. Some things you can do to minimize shock are:Keep the person still and don't move them unless it's necessary.
Begin CPR if the person shows no signs of life.
Loosen tight clothing.
Cover the person with a blanket to prevent them getting a chill.
Prevent them from eating or drinking anything.
Apply pressure to bleeding sites so that the person experiences less blood loss.

"
Check for unresponsiveness.,
Call the Emergency Services.,
Keep the victim on his back.,
Rapidly push down on the center of the chest.",How to Do CPR1," If an adult or teen collapses but remains conscious, CPR is not typically needed. If they lose consciousness and are no longer responsive, however, you should perform some form of CPR even if you are untrained or rusty in your abilities.Shake the victim's shoulders and loudly ask ""Are you okay?"" If you receive no response, check for a pulse or breathing while someone calls emergency services.
Hands-only CPR is ideal for those without formal CPR training or for people unsure in their CPR abilities. It does not involve the rescue breathing measures associated with conventional CPR but instead focuses on chest compressions.;
, If you find a person unresponsive and decide to do some form of CPR, you should still immediately call your local emergency number before you do anything else.CPR can revive people on occasion, but it should be viewed as buying time until emergency personnel arrive with appropriate equipment.


If two or more people are available, one person should dial for help while the begins CPR.If a person is unresponsive because of suffocation (from drowning, for example), then it's recommended to immediately begin CPR for one minute and then call your local emergency number.If the victim is a child between the ages of one to eight years, perform five cycles of chest compressions and rescue breathing before calling Emergency Services if you are the only person available. This should take roughly two minutes.

Calling Emergency Services will bring paramedics to the location. Typically, the dispatcher will also be able to instruct you on how to perform CPR.

, In order to perform hands-only CPR, the victim should be positioned on his back (supine), preferably on a firm surface, with the head facing up.If the person is on his sides or stomach (prone), then gently roll him onto his back while trying to support his head and neck. Try to make note if the person experienced significant trauma while falling and becoming unconscious.


Once on his back, kneel next to the person's neck and shoulders so you have better access to his chest and mouth.
Keep in mind that you should not move the person if you suspect he may have suffered a significant head, neck or spinal injury. In this case, moving him is life-threatening and should be avoided, unless emergency help won't be available for a long time (a few hours or more).

, Place one hand directly over the center of the person's chest (between the person's nipples, generally) and your other hand on top of the first for reinforcement. Press down on the victim's chest firmly and quickly — aim for about 100 chest compressions a minute until paramedics arrive.If you're not sure what 100 compressions a minute really means, try doing your compressions to the beat of the Bee Gee's song ""Stain' Alive.""Use your upper body weight and strength, not just your arm strength, to push straight down on the chest.
Your chest compressions should cause the person's chest to depress at least 2 inches (5 cm). Push hard and understand that it is likely you will break the person's ribs. This is extremely common, and you shouldn't stop compressions even if you think this has happened.
Chest compressions are hard work and you may have to switch off with other bystanders before emergency personnel arrive.
Continue doing this action as until the person becomes responsive or until the emergency medical team arrive and take over.

"
"
Follow the same initial procedures as hands-only CPR.,
Proceed to open the airway.,
Place your mouth over the victim's mouth.,
Start with two rescue breaths.,
Repeat cycles as needed.",How to Do CPR2," Even if you have recent CPR training and are confident of your abilities, you still need to assess the person to see if she is responsive and move her onto her back if she is not and shows no sign of neck/head/spine injury.Try to call emergency services before starting chest compressions and look for someone to trade off with.

If performing CPR on a small child between the ages of one and eight years, only use one hand to perform chest compressions.
The rate of chest compressions is the same for both adults and children (roughly 100 per minute).
For children between the ages of one and eight years, you will need to depress the sternum (chest bone) 1/3 to 1/2 of the depth of the child's chest.
If you have recent CPR training, perform only 30 chest compressions before moving on to the breathing assistance phase of CPR.

, If you're trained in CPR, confident of your abilities (not rusty) and you've performed 30 chest compressions, then proceed to open the person's airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift technique,or the jaw-thrust if you suspect a neck/head/spine injury. Put your palm on his forehead and gently tilt (extend) his head back a little. Then with your other hand, gently lift the chin forward to open up his airway, making it easier to give him oxygen.


Take five to 10 seconds to check for normal breathing. Look for chest motion, listen for breathing, and see if you can feel the victim's breath on your cheek or ear.
Note that gasping is not considered to be normal breathing.
If he is already breathing, no breathing assistance is needed. However, If he still is not breathing, then proceed to the mouth-to-mouth breathing part of CPR.
To perform the jaw-thrust technique, sit above the person's head. Place one hand on each side of the person's jaw and lift the jaw so that it is jutting forward, as though the person has an underbite., Once the person's head is tilted and her chin lifted, make sure her mouth is free of any objects blocking their airway. Then, use one hand to pinch the victim's nostrils closed and cover her mouth completely with your own mouth.Form a seal with your mouth so that no air can escape while you attempt to give the victim a rescue breath.


You should be aware that mouth-to-mouth CPR can transfer infectious viral and bacterial diseases between the victim and the rescuer.
Before contacting her mouth with yours, wipe away any vomit, mucus or excess saliva that may be present.
Rescue breathing can also be mouth-to-nose breathing if the person's mouth is seriously injured or can't be opened.

, Once your mouth is over the other person's, forcefully breathe into his mouth for at least one full second and watch his chest to determine if it rises a little or not.If it does, give the second breath, if it doesn't then repeat the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver and try again. Don't be too timid or grossed out because a person's life is in your hands.


Although there's carbon dioxide in your breath when you exhale, there's still enough oxygen to benefit a victim during CPR. Again, the purpose isn't always to revive him or continue indefinitely, but to buy some time for him until paramedics arrive.
Approximately 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths is considered to be one cycle of conventional CPR for both adults and children.
If performing CPR on a child between the ages of one and eight years, you can use gentler breaths to inflate their lungs.

, Follow the two rescue breaths with another round of 30 chest compressions and two more rescue breaths. Repeat as needed until the victim becomes responsive or until emergency medical personnel can take over. Remember that chest compressions attempt to restore some sort of circulation, while the rescue breathing provides some (but not much) oxygen to prevent tissues, particularly the brain, from dying.

"
Assess the situation.,
Position the baby between your forearms.,
Deliver back blows to dislodge an airway obstruction.,
Place the baby on her back.,
Position your fingers in the center of the baby's chest.,
Gently compress the chest.,
Cover the baby's nose and mouth and breathe.,
Repeat the cycle as needed.",How to Do CPR3," The most common cause of infant suffocation is choking. You need to assess the situation to determine if the airway is completely blocked or only partially blocked.If the baby is coughing or gagging, the airway is partially blocked. Let the baby continue to cough, as this is the best way to dislodge the blockage.
If the baby is not able to cough and begins to turn bright red or blue, the airway is completely blocked. You will need to perform back blows and chest compressions to dislodge the blockage.
If your baby is ill, having an allergic reaction, or is suffocating because the airway is swollen, you can perform chest compressions and rescue breaths, but you will need to call local emergency services immediately.

, Position the baby so that she is face-up on one forearm. Cradle the back of her head with the hand of the same forearm. Place your other forearm over the baby's front and gently turn her over so that she is face-down, remaining sandwiched in between your arms the entire time.Use your thumb and fingers to hold the jaw as you turn the baby.
Lower your bottom arm onto your thigh. The baby's head should be lower than her chest.
Note that back blows should only be delivered if the baby is still conscious. If the baby falls unconscious, skip the back blows and proceed straight to the chest compressions and rescue breaths.

, Use the heel of your dominant hand to deliver five gentle yet distinct back blows in between the baby's shoulder blades.Continue to support the baby's neck and head by holding his jaw between your thumb and forefingers.
Giving CPR to a baby is often walking a fine line between being effective and causing injury. However, a minor musculoskeletal injury is a small price to pay for saving a life.

, After delivering the gentle back blows, place your free hand on the back of the baby's head, resting your arm firmly along the baby's spine. Carefully turn the baby back over so she is face-up again.Don't lift the baby's head as you turn her, as this can force the clog back into her throat. Keep the head down.
The baby should remain sandwiched in between your arms as you turn her.
Remember to remain calm and talk soothingly to the baby. She can't comprehend your words, but she can pick up on your calming/loving tone.

, Position the tips of two or three fingers in the center of the baby's chest while supporting the baby's neck and head with your other hand. Use the thumb and fingers to hold the jaw as you sandwich the baby in between your forearms. The lower arm should support the baby's back on your opposite thigh, and the baby's head should be lower than the rest of his body.You could also place the baby on their back on a firm, flat surface, like a table or the floor.
The fingers should be placed in between the baby's nipples at the center of his chest.

, Push straight down on the chest, depressing it by about 1.5 inches (4 cm). If the baby is conscious, only perform five compressions. If the baby is unconscious, perform 30 compressions.Pump rapidly at a rate of 100 compressions per minute.
Each compression should be smooth, not abrupt or shaky.
Be careful not to injure the baby's ribs during the compressions.

, You do not need to pinch the nose plugged as you would do with an adult. Instead, seal off the baby's breathing passages by placing your entire mouth over his nose and mouth.Make sure to wipe away any vomit, blood, mucus or saliva first.


Give two gentle rescue breaths. Deliver one puff of air into the baby's mouth. If the chest moves, deliver the second puff of air.
If the chest does not move, attempt to clear the airway again before administering the second breath.
Do not deliver deep breaths of air from your lungs. Instead, use the muscles in your cheeks to deliver gentle puffs of air.

, Repeat chest compressions and rescue breaths as needed until the baby begins to breath again or until emergency medical professionals arrive.


If you suspect that the baby is choking on a foreign object, you should look into her mouth after every round of chest compressions.
Each cycle should consist of 30 chest compressions followed by two emergency breaths.

Seek medical assistance.,
Roll the person on her back on a hard surface.Move the person onto her back while supporting the head and neck.,
Open the person’s mouth.Using your thumb and an index finger, open the choking person’s mouth.,
Look into the victim's mouth.,
Tilt the head back if you cannot see an object.,
Watch for evidence of breathing.,
Give first aid for unconsciousness if the person is breathing.While waiting for emergency medical assistance to arrive, keep careful watch over the person and perform first aid as needed:


Make sure that the person continues to breathe.,
Prepare for rescue breathing.Keep the person’s head tilted back.,
Begin breathing.,
Reposition the head if the person does not begin breathing.Turn the head slightly or tilt it back slightly more, then again try giving two breaths with a pause between.

,
Start performing compressions.,
Stop and check to see if you can see the object causing the blockage.After 30 chest compressions, open the person's mouth again and look for a dislodged object.,
Continue the cycle until help arrives, if the person does not resume breathing.",How to Do the Heimlich Maneuver on an Unconscious Adult," Immediately ask someone to call 911 (or another emergency number) as you begin providing assistance to the unconscious person.If you are alone, shout for help as you begin the Heimlich maneuver.;
, Place the choking person on a hard surface (such as a floor) that can support the body while you perform the maneuver., Position your thumb on top of the person's tongue and your other finger under the chin.

, If you can see an object and it is loose, remove it from the person’s mouth.With the person's head turned to the side, use a finger or two to gently sweep the object out of the person’s mouth. Be careful not to push the object deeper.

, If you cannot see what is lodged in the person’s mouth, tilt the head back and lift the chin. This will open the person’s airway.Generally choking victims will not also have spinal injuries, but if the person has suspected head, neck, or spine injuries, use a jaw-thrust to open his airway, not head-tilt chin-lift.

, Lean your head down and place your ear near the unconscious person’s mouth. Listen for sounds of breathing. Watch the person’s chest to see if it rises and falls, indicating that the person is breathing. You can also place your hand on the person’s chest to feel if it rises and falls. Listen, watch, and feel for breathing for five seconds.If the person is not breathing, start performing rescue breathing.

,
Check the person’s pulse frequently.
If the person’s breathing or pulse stops at any time, perform CPR.
If the person’s back is not injured, roll the person on her side. Bend her top leg at the knee.
Keep the person warm while you wait for assistance.

, Pinch the person’s nostrils closed, using your thumb and forefinger. Cover the person’s mouth tightly with your mouth.

, Keeping a tight seal over the person’s mouth, slowly give two breaths (“rescue breaths”). Pause between each breath. Watch for the victim's chest to rise.If the chest does not rise, reopen the airway, check your seal on his mouth/nose and breathe harder.

,, Begin chest compressions if the object is removed but the victim no longer has a pulse.To perform chest compressions:Ensure that the person is lying flat on the floor on a hard surface.
Place the heel of one of your hands on the person’s breastbone, right between her nipples.
Place the heel of your second hand on top of the first.
Lean directly over your hands. Push down with your hands at least 2 inches into the person’s chest, then let the chest rise completely. You will have to push hard and fast. Count out 30 quick chest compressions.

, Pull it out if you can. Attempt a quick sweep again if no object is immediately seen.


If you do not see the object, give two rescue breaths again, with a one second pause between each.

, If the person’s chest is still not rising and falling, keep repeating the cycle of 30 chest compressions, then two rescue breaths, until emergency medical assistance arrives.If another person is with you, switch off with him every two cycles. CPR is exhausting. Do not attempt to continue CPR if you are too tired. Improper CPR is not helpful to the patient.

Collect important paperwork.,
Assemble your basic tools and supplies.,
Include bandaging materials.,
Have food and water.,
Stock the kit with pet-friendly medicines.",How to Make a Cat First Aid Kit1," You might not think of it off-hand, but you’ll need to have important information about your cat in the kit. This includes telephone phone numbers, identifying details, and your pet’s medical records. You may need these documents in an emergency.


You may not have time to get your cat to a vet in an emergency. Have a cat-specific first aid manual in the kit, for easy reference.Make sure to have your vet’s telephone number, the poison control hotline number, and the contact details of and directions to a nearby emergency animal clinic, as well.
Include identification details for your pet, like sex, appearance, breed, and any health concerns or distinguishing traits. Also have up-to-date medical records, like her proofs of vaccination.
Consider putting these documents into a waterproof, zip-lock bag to keep them from the elements.;
, You’ll need to gather an array of supplies for the first aid kit. Start with basic items that you can use in any medical emergency.You should have supplies for treating and disinfecting wounds. Get items like antiseptic wipes or ointment and rubbing alcohol, and also protective gloves. Cotton balls and swabs may come in handy, as well, for wiping clean wounds or applying substances like alcohol.
A magnifying glass, a pair of scissors, tongue depressor, penlight, and tweezers are useful to help you see and treat some kinds of injuries.
For insect bites, consider including sting stop pads or even an old credit card to scrape away imbedded stingers.You will also want to be ready for poisoning, with items like milk of magnesia to absorb poison and hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting. Always talk to a vet or poison control center before treating poison.Have a muzzle, a towel or pillowcase for restraint, a leash, rectal thermometer, and an oral syringe, as well., Many pet injuries are wounds, which bleed and will need to be staunched and bandaged. Make sure to have a variety of gauzes and bandages for such a situation.


2 and 4 inch gauze squares can be used to apply pressure directly to a wound to stop bleeding.You will need adhesive tape to secure them.
Bandage or gauze rolls will allow you to wrap a wound and will keep the gauze square in place.
Flexible wrap or Vetwrap can be applied to secure and compress the gauze, as well, keeping pressure on the wound until your cat gets proper medical care.Human band-aids are also good to have, in case you get scratched or bitten while treating the cat.

, In planning for all situations, you should account for emergencies where your cat needs food or water or other nutritional support. Pack water but also a variety of quick-acting supplies.


Gatorade or Pedialyte are good in cases of dehydration and will hydrate your cat while replenishing her electrolytes.
Supplements like Nutri-Cal, Vitacal, or Nutristat are high-calorie gels that will give pets energy and a nutritional boost.You might also go with a high-calorie, high-sugar energy source like Karo Syrup., Finally, add medicines for pain relief, itching, allergic reactions, and diarrhea or constipation. Talk to your vet to be sure what meds are pet safe.A cortisone spray or cream is good to stop itching from insect bites, for example.
You can also keep cat laxatives or anti-diarrheal medication like Pet Pectate on hand. Just be sure that it doesn’t contain salicylates, a compound found in aspirin that is toxic to cats.
Some people suggest keeping dehydrated or canned pumpkin mix in your kit, which will ease a cat’s constipation.Cats can safely consume allergy medication like Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). However, talk to your vet about proper dosages."

Check if the baby is conscious.,
If the baby is conscious but choking, administer first aid before attempting CPR.,
Check the baby's pulse.",How to Do CPR on a Baby1," It's best to flick your fingers against the feet. If the baby doesn't respond, ask someone to call for emergency help while you go on to the next step. If you are alone with the baby, follow the steps below for 2 minutes (to provide immediate first aid) before calling emergency services., Whether the baby is breathing should determine your course of action:


If the baby is coughing or gagging while choking, let her continue to cough and gag on her own. Coughing and gagging — a good sign — means that her airways are only partially blocked.If the baby is not coughing, you'll need to be prepared to perform back blows and/or chest thrusts in order to dislodge whatever is blocking her airways.







, Check for breathing again, and this time place your index and middle fingers on the inside of the baby's arm, between the elbow and the shoulder.


If the baby has a pulse and is breathing, put the body in recovery position. See How to Put Someone in Recovery Position for more detailed information.






If there is no pulse and no breathing, continue with the next steps to perform CPR, which is a combination of compressions and breaths.

"
Buy a generic, human first aid kit.,
Remove any potentially harmful meds.,
Add pet-specific items.,
Have paperwork on hand.",How to Make a Cat First Aid Kit2," Another easy option is to buy a human first aid kit (or find one on hand) and then customize it for your pet by adding supplies. This may also prove less pricy than buying each item individually or investing in a ready-made model.


A basic American Red Cross first aid kit will run about $20. Deluxe family models are a bit more, in the range of $25 to $30.A good first aid kit will be able to treat cuts, scrapes, swelling, allergic reactions, and pain. Usually they contain different kinds of bandages and adhesive tape, gauze, antiseptic wipes, cold compresses, and rubbing alcohol.
Kits might also contain gloves, hand sanitizer, pain medication like aspirin, a thermometer, and a hydrocortisone pack.

, Most of the items in a first aid pack are helpful or, at worst, harmless for your cat. However, some human medicines are not OK for cats and should be removed.


Get rid of any aspirin tablets. Aspirin is toxic for cats because they lack the enzymes to break it down. It can cause them to vomit or bleed internally and can even affect their nervous system and lead to death.The same goes for other painkillers like Aleve, Advil, Motrin (i.e. non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) and Tylenol (Acetaminophen). The first kind can cause ulcers or kidney failure, while the second damages a cat’s red blood cells., Now, add things that your pet may need in case of an emergency or injury but that aren’t already in the kit. Think of possible scenarios and what you might require in those situations.Consider having a pet first-aid book, with instructions on how to treat injuries, poison, and other emergencies.
A muzzle of some kind is useful, as an injured or distressed cat is more likely to bite. You’ll be able to handle her more safely with a towel, as well. Of course, don’t muzzle a cat that is vomiting, choking, or having trouble breathing.Keep some water for treating dehydration and food or a nutritional supplement in case your pet needs emergency nourishment.
A nylon leash and self-sticking bandages are also helpful.

, Like before, gather together all of your pet’s medical records as well as important phone numbers and contact information, in a water-proof container.It’s a good idea to have phone numbers and directions for the nearest pet clinic, your vet, and a poison control center or hotline.
Have proof of your cat’s vaccinations for rabies and other diseases, copies of medical records, and a current photo in case she gets lost.
You can include other information like the cat’s breed, age, sex, and any other health problems, as well as your own contact details.

Try a pet store.,
Shop online.,
Read reviews and compare prices.",How to Make a Cat First Aid Kit3," If you don’t want to spend the time or effort to put together first aid kit, you can always buy one ready-made. More and more pet or cat-specific first aid kits are on the market these days. Start at your local pet supply store.


Many ready-made first aid kits are designed for either cats or dogs. These have basic supplies like gauze, water bottles, food, alcohol pads, and antibiotic ointment. Expect to pay $25 or more for one.
There are also cat-specific first aid and emergency evacuation kits. These are more expensive, some over $150, and can have medical items and food and water supplies for several days.
The Ready America “Grab n’ Go” 2-person emergency cat set is designed to keep you and your pet safe and fed for up to 3 days in an emergency. It contains food, water pouches, light sticks, a separate first aid kit, matches, pet collar, alcohol pads, and more., You will be able to find many of the same premade kits by shopping online. Try sites like Amazon.com or websites that cater only to pets, like Petsupplies.com and Petsmart.com. There you can compare prices and look for a kit that has everything you want.


Prices online will range from about $20 to over $50, depending on the model and its contents.
Keep in mind that you may end paying more online with added shipping costs, even if you are buying from a surplus merchandise site like Overstock.com.

, While a pet first aid kit is not a high-ticket purchase, you can still get the best bang for your money. Read reviews online, ask questions at your local pet store, and be sure to know what is inside each kit.


Most kits have the same generic items that are found in any first aid kit, like bandages, adhesive tape, cotton balls, and antiseptics.
The biggest difference between kits will be the make and pet-specific items. Some kits come with carrying cases, for instance. Will you need the kit on the go? Do you need certain pet items like a tick-remover or muzzle?
Don’t forget to take a look at canine first aid kits, as well. While made for dogs, they have most of the same items and are also a bit more common. For example, the Outdoor Safety Pro Model 2000 is a high-quality canine first aid kit. It contains 70 pieces and can handle anything from skunk spray and small wounds to aid for major injuries."

Open the airway.,
Give the baby two rescue breaths.,
Check for the brachial pulse after doing the first two rescue breaths﻿.,
Compress the chest 30 times with several fingers.,
Perform the same series of two rescue breaths and 30 chest compressions until you are relieved or see signs of life.,
To remember the stages of CPR, remember ""ABC.",How to Do CPR on a Baby2," Gently lift the baby's head back and chin up to open the child's airway. The airway is small, so this won't be a drastic movement. Again, check for breathing during this time, but for no longer than 10 seconds.

, If you have one, put a face shield on the baby to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids. Pinch the nose shut, tilt the head back, push up the chin, and give two breaths, each lasting about one second. Exhale gently until the chest rises; exhaling too forcefully can cause injury.Remember to pause in between breaths to let the air out.
If you feel that the breaths did not go in (the chest doesn't rise at all) the airway is obstructed and the child may be choking. See this article for more information on helping an infant that is choking.

, If there is no pulse, begin CPR on baby.

, Take two or three fingers held together and place them in the middle of the baby's chest right below the nipples. Gently, fluidly compress the baby's chest 30 times.


If you need to brace your fingers because they are getting tired, use your second hand to help assist the process. Otherwise, keep your second hand cradling the baby's head.
Try to perform your chest compressions at a rate of about 100 compressions per minute.That may seem like a lot, but it's actually only a little over one chest compression a second. Still, try to maintain a fluid push and release when performing compressions.
Press down 1/3 to 1/2 the depth of the baby's chest. This usually works out to about 1 and 1/2 inches., At the right speed, you should do about 5 sets of rescue breaths and compressions within approximately two minutes. Once you start CPR, don't stop unless:

You see signs of life (baby moves, coughs, breathes noticeably, or vocalizes). Vomiting is not a sign of life.






Another trained person takes over






A defibrillator is ready to be used






The scene becomes suddenly unsafe







,""Keep this useful mnemonic handy in order to remember the process of delivering CPR.



A is for airway. Open or check that the airway is open.

B is for breathing. Pinch the nose, tilt the head back, and give two rescue breaths.

C is for circulation. Check if the baby has a pulse. If not, perform 30 chest compressions.

Position the injured person on his back.,
Stand on the injured person's side.,
Take hold of the injured person.,
Shift the weight of the injured person.,
Stand in unison.",How to Do a Two Person Arm Carry1," To start, position the injured person on his back. This helps get the injured person in the correct position to be carried. You should carry someone from the side if he's unresponsive or unable to move. It's usually safer to carry someone in a sitting position, but this is not always possible if the person is unable to change positions. It's safer, in this case, to carry the injured person from the side.Go slowly to avoid further injury. If the injured person is able to talk, check in frequently to make sure he is comfortable throughout the process.
In the event the injured person is unconscious, you may want to tie his hands loosely together at the wrists. This can make the carrying process easier. If you have something that can be used to tie the injured person's hands, like thick rope or a bandana, you can use this.Do not use anything thin or sharp to tie the person's hands — this can cut the person's wrists.;
, From here, you and your partner should each stand on the side of the injured person. One person should stand near the injured person's shoulders and the other should stand near the injured person's knees. Both of you should bend down on one knee so you're level with the injured person., From here, you and your partner can take hold of the injured person. Depending on where you're standing, you'll need to take hold of different parts of the injured person.


The person standing near the injured person's chest should slip one arm beneath the injured person's shoulder and the other arm beneath the injured person's waist.The person standing near the injured person's knees should place one arm beneath the injured person's hips and the other arm beneath the injured person's knees., From here, you can shift the weight of the injured person into you and your partner's arms. In unison, you and your partner should shift your weight backwards. Lift the injured person up together, until the injured person is level with you and your partner's knees. Still working in unison, both you and your partner should turn the injured person in towards your chests., From here, you and your partner can rise to your feet. Make sure you and your partner are communicating so you lift at the same time, as not to jostle or otherwise disturb the injured person. As you stand, make sure to carry the injured person high up, towards both of your chests.Lift with your legs, not your back. If you're truly the only people who can help the person, you mustn't hurt yourselves in the process.
In the the event the injured person is very heavy, you may need to have another person assist in supporting the injured person's weight.

Remove the electrical source.,
Cover your pet with a blanket.,
Examine your pet.,
Breathe for your pet.,
Perform CPR on your dog or cat.,
Place cold compresses on your pet’s mouth.,
Take your pet to your veterinarian immediately.,
Monitor your dog.,
Cover or hide electrical cords.,
Do not leave your pets unattended around sockets and power cords.,
Keep electrical sources turned off.",How to Give First Aid to an Electrocuted Animal," Before touching your pet, turn off or remove the source of electrocution.This will involve unplugging the electrical cord from the electrical socket and/or shutting off the electricity.Use a wooden broom handle to gently move your pet away from the electrical source. A wooden broomstick is ideal because it would not conduct an electrical current that would shock you.It is very important that you not touch your pet, or any fluids from your pet, until you have removed the electrical source. This is especially important if his body is rigid—he could be carrying an electrical current that could deliver a serious shock to you.;
, After your pet has been electrocuted, covering him with a blanket will help prevent heat loss.Wrapping him in a blanket can also prevent electrocution-induced shock.If your pet is so agitated that it looks like he may bite you, wrapping him in a blanket can help restrain him and keep him from biting you. Muzzling him could also keep him from biting you,but you should not do this if he is having trouble breathing.

, With your pet removed from the electrical source, you will need to examine your pet. You can assess his breathing in a few different ways, such as watching for chest movements (chest moving up and down) and putting your hand in front of his nose to feel for his breath.You can also gently pluck a few hairs from his coat, hold them in front of his nose, and see if the hairs move. If the hairs move back and forth, your pet is breathing.Check your pet’s pulse by placing your finger on the inside of his middle thigh.This may be challenging if you have a small animal, such as a hamster or guinea pig, but do your best to find his pulse.
Check the color of your pet’s gums. If they are blue or white, he is not receiving enough oxygen. White gums indicate poor blood circulation.Your pet will need CPR is he is not breathing and does not have a pulse.Artificial respiration (AR), also known as mouth-to-snout resuscitation, would be needed if he is not breathing, but does have a pulse., It is best for your veterinarian to resuscitate your pet after electrocution. However, if you cannot get your pet to your veterinarian right away, you may have to make an initial attempt to get him breathing again. AR involves you placing your mouth next to your pet’s nose and breathing into his nostrils.Use this on a dog or cat.


Before performing AR, open your pet’s mouth to clear out any foreign particles or objects that may be in the way. Pull his tongue out of the way so you can close his mouth more easily.Breathe for your pet, every four to five seconds,until you see his chest expand. After each breath, remove your mouth so his lungs can deflate.
If you do not see chest expansion, hold his mouth shut and blow with more force every two to three seconds.Keeping his mouth closed keeps the air from exiting out of his mouth.

, If your dog or cat does not start breathing on his own after AR, or no longer has a pulse, he will need CPR. As with AR, your veterinarian should perform CPR. However, you may need to perform initial CPR on your own.


To perform CPR on your cat, lay him on his side. Position the thumb and index finger of one hand on either side of his chest behind his elbows. Squeeze his chest to about one-half of its normal thickness, 15 times every 10 seconds. Give your cat one breath per 10 compressions.For a dog, he will also need to be on his side, right side facing up. Position your hands near his heart—one palm of top of the other for a large dog, one palm on each side of the chest above the heart for a small dog. Press down to about one-quarter to one-third the thickness of his chest (80 times/minute for a large dog, 100 times/minute for a small dog).For CPR in dogs, give one breath per five chest compressions., Chewing on electrical cords is a common cause of electrocution in pets, especially for dogs.If you notice burn marks around your pet’s mouth from chewing on an electrical cord, place cold compresses on the burns as initial first aid.A bag of frozen bag of vegetables would work well as a cold compress.You could also make a compress by placing some ice in a plastic bag and wrapping the bag in a towel.
If your pet will let you, hold the compress against the burns for about 20 minutes.Keep in mind that your pet may be too agitated for you to do this.

, Even with your first aid, it is imperative that you take your pet to your veterinarian as soon as possible. Electrocution is a life-threatening emergency in animals.It can cause fluid build-up in the lungs and abnormal electrical activity in the heart, both of which can put your pet’s life at risk.Even if your pet looks fine on the outside after being electrocuted, he will still need immediate veterinary care.If your veterinarian is not available, take your pet to an emergency veterinary clinic.
To care for your pet after electrocution, your veterinary team may perform different measures to stimulate his breathing and pulse, including passing an endotracheal tube down his throat and giving him oxygen.
The team may also place an intravenous catheter in one of his leg veins to give him fluids, epinephrine, or other emergency medications to stimulate his heart and breathing and stabilize him., In the first 12 hours after your veterinarian has treated your pet for electrocution, you should monitor your pet’s breathing and pulse.If your pet suffered mouth burns as a result of electrocution, you will need to monitor those burns for up to several weeks.Your pet’s breathing should be steady and unforced. His pulse should be steady and strong.
Your veterinarian can recommend topical treatments to treat the burn wounds.

, For pets that are extremely inquisitive, like kittens, and puppies, it can be very tempting for them to gnaw on electrical cords. To keep them from doing this, consider purchasing a cover that you can slip over the cords.These covers are available at your local electronics store.


Covering the cover also keeps them organized, especially if you have multiple power cords in one place.
You could also spray the cords with a bitter-tasting spray, which is available at your local pet store.As best you can, hide the cords close to the walls behind your furniture. If the cords are short, you could attach an extension cord to them so you can push them behind the furniture., Your pets may be tempted to investigate the sockets and cords when you are not looking. If your pets are particularly curious, stay in the room with them to make sure they are not putting themselves at risk of electrocution.You could also purchase socket covers at your local hardware to store.

, With the exception of appliances and televisions, you may keep items such as lamps and computers plugged in and turned on for long periods. To keep your pet from chewing on a ‘live’ electrical cord, turn off those items when you are finished using them.You could even unplug the cord from the wall—this could actually save you a little money on your electric bill!

Get in position.,
Create a two-handed seat.,
Try a four-handed seat if the injured person is conscious.",How to Do a Two Person Arm Carry2," It may be easier, safer, and more comfortable for the injured person to lift her by creating a seat with you and your partner's arms. If you're carrying someone who's able to move into a seated position, make a seat for that person. You can do so with two hands or four hands. Regardless of the position you're using, you start in the same position.


Get the injured person on her back. If she is able to lean forward slightly in a seated position, ask her to do so.You and your partner should kneel down on either side of the injured person. Make sure you and your partner are facing each other., If an injured person is unconscious, use a two-handed seat. To do this, you and your partner should each place one hand below the injured person's shoulders and one hand below the injured person's knees. You should then grasp one another's wrists, forming a hammock-like seat for the injured person.Stand together in unison. Make sure to communicate with your partner so you're standing at the same time to avoid jostling the injured person.When walking, walk in the direction the injured person is facing.

, The four-handed seat requires participation from the injured person. It should only be used if the injured person is conscious and able to assist. To start, grab your own left wrist with your right hand. Have your partner do the same. Then, you should grab your partner's right wrist with your left hand. Your partner will grab your right wrist with his left hand. This creates a square-shaped seat with your arms.You should have the injured person shift to the sitting position. You and your partner should lower your bodies, bringing the seat you've created down near the injured person's bottom.Have the injured person sit on your forearms. The injured person should place her arms on you and your partner's shoulders for balance.Again, lift slowly and in unison. Walk in the direction the injured person is facing."

Get professional training before attempting an actual rescue.,
Ask how you can help first.,
Call 9-11 in the event of life-threatening injuries.",How to Do a Two Person Arm Carry3," While it can be fun to practice various carrying techniques with a friend, you should not attempt to perform them on an injured person without professional training. Enroll in a first aid course, nursing course, or a course on emergency or disability services if you want to be able to perform these techniques on someone who's injured or incapacitated. You should have some kind of professional certification before attempting any of these techniques.Without professional training, it can be hard to assess the depth of someone's injuries. You may be unsure which carry to use if you're unable to tell if it's safe to move someone in a particular position.
Carrying someone safely requires a great deal of practice and guidance. You should practice carrying someone with the supervision of a professional, who can correct your form and provide tips. Professional training can help you learn how to conduct yourself safely during an emergency.

, If someone is injured or disabled, don't jump to performing one of the above techniques. Ask that person how he should be moved first, and check if the person has any special needs or considerations you should keep in mind. An injured or disabled person may also be waiting on professional services, and may not need the help of you and your partner. It's always better to ask first., If a person has life-threatening injuries, call 9-11 immediately. Do not attempt to move the person unless you are advised by a 9-11 dispatcher to do so."

Try to stop the bleeding as well as you can.,
Check if an object is lodged in the area of the wound.,
See a doctor immediately if the cut has been caused by a human or animal bite.,
Consider the area of the injury.,
Understand why stitches are used.,
Consider the depth of the wound.,
Evaluate the width of the wound.,
Look at the location of the wound.,
Ask your doctor about getting a tetanus shot.",How to Determine if a Cut Needs Stitches," Elevate the injured body part above the level of the heart, as this can help to diminish bleeding. Use a clean cloth or slightly damp paper towel, and apply firm pressure to the open wound for about 5 minutes.Then, remove the cloth or paper towel to check if it's still bleeding.


If it's bleeding is significant, do not proceed to any other steps and go to the hospital immediately.If the bleeding is uncontrollable, or blood is gushing from the wound, call emergency services immediately, as this can be life threatening.;
, If there is foreign material present in the injury, it is always important to see a doctor right away.This is because of the risk of infection, the need to assess if and how the object can be removed safely, as well as the possibility of needing stitches.


Do not try to remove the object. Sometimes the object helps to stop the wound from bleeding excessively. If there is anything stuck in the wound, you should see a doctor in the emergency room immediately., These cuts pose a much higher risk of infection, you may need to be vaccinated for prevention, and receive antibiotics, so regardless of whether stitches are needed you should seek professional medical help., If the cut is on the face, the hands, the mouth, or the genitals it is important to be seen by a doctor, as you may need stitching for cosmetic reasons and proper healing., Stitches have a multitude of uses. The most common reasons to get stitches are:To close a wound that is too big to be closed otherwise. Using stitches to bring the edges of the wound together can help to speed up healing.
To prevent infection. If you have a large, gaping wound, closing it with stitches can help to minimize the risk of infection (as skin that is broken open, especially large, gaping wounds, are a prime target for an infection to enter the body).
To prevent or reduce scarring after your wound heals. This is especially important when the cut is on areas of the body that are more cosmetically important, such as the face.

, If it is greater than 1/4 inch deep, the wound may be eligible for stitching. If it's deep enough that you can see yellow fatty tissue, or even bone, you should definitely see a doctor for treatment., Are the edges of the wound close together, or do they need to be pulled together to cover the exposed tissue? If the edges of the wound need to be pulled together to cover a gap of exposed tissue, this is an indication that stitches may be required. By pulling the edges of the wound close enough to where they can touch, stitches can help to speed healing., If the open wound is located on a specific area of the body where there is a lot of movement involved, it will most likely need stitching to prevent re-opening of the wound caused by movement and stretching of the skin. For example, an open wound on the knee joint or fingers (especially where joints connect) would be eligible for stitches whereas an open wound on the thigh would not really need stitching., Tetanus shots last no longer than 10 years and then you'll have to be re-vaccinated. If you have an open wound and it's been longer than 10 years since you've had a tetanus shot, go to the hospital.While you are at the hospital, you can have the doctor evaluate the cut also to see if it will need stitching.

Take a blood test.,
Determine your overall health.,
Check additional levels in your blood.,
Give your medical history to your doctor.,
Continue to check your blood levels.",How to Diagnose Aspirin Poisoning2," Once you go to the doctor or hospital with suspected aspirin poisoning, your doctor will perform a blood test. This will test the precise level of aspirin in your blood. This will let your doctor know if your symptoms are because of the excessive amounts of aspirin in your blood., Due to the severity of many of the symptoms of aspirin poisoning, your doctor will do an overall check of your vitals and organ systems. This will tell your doctor whether or not you need care for your symptoms, such as for your cardiac or pulmonary systems.


This will include checking your temperature, breath and heart sounds, and alertness.Routine blood work will also be ordered to assess for anemia, and kidney function.

, Once your doctor determines the levels of aspirin in your blood, there are other levels to be checked. Your doctor may take additional blood samples to check your blood pH, which will show the amount of acid in your blood.


Your doctor will also look for any amounts of carbon dioxide or bicarbonate in your blood., When you go in for treatment for aspirin poisoning, your doctor will ask you for a history of what medications you have been taking. This will help your doctor determine if you have been taking medications with aspirin and at what concentrations.


Your doctor will also ask you about any medication conditions you have in order to determine if this contributed to your aspirin poisoning.Be sure to bring a list of medications to the doctor, and be prepared with the dosages taken. You can also bring the actual medication bottles with you so the doctors can be sure what was actually consumed.

, When you are undergoing treatment, your doctor will continue to check your blood levels. This will let your doctor know if you are responding to treatment, if you need to continue treatment, and if you are out of the woods with symptoms. "

Determine if you have acute aspirin poisoning.,
Recognize if you have chronic aspirin poisoning.,
Look for common products with aspirin.,
Get treated for aspirin poisoning.",How to Diagnose Aspirin Poisoning3," There are two different types of aspirin poisoning. The first is acute aspirin poisoning, sometimes called rapid aspirin poisoning, that occurs when you get too much of the acetylsalicylic acid at one time. This requires a very large dose of aspirin at one time, which means that this type of aspirin overdose is rarely accidental.


For example, a 150 pound person would have to take more than 30 tablets of 325 mg aspirin to even develop a mild case of acute aspirin poisoning.This type most commonly happens through intentional overdose (suicide attempt) or accidental overdose (either children or adult).

, The other type of aspirin poisoning is chronic aspirin poisoning. This happens gradually when you unintentionally take a larger than recommended dose aspirin over a period of days. This can happen accidentally for people of all ages if they are given too much.


Adults may also easily develop this type of poisoning over the course of several weeks because they take too much aspirin each day.This commonly happens by either taking too much aspirin as a preventative measure against heart attack or a result of medication interactions causing the aspirin to metabolize differently.

, One way that you may develop aspirin poisoning is to not know that a product contains aspirin. Wintergreen oil, which contains aspirin, is used in skin treatments and is highly toxic if even a small amount is swallowed.There are also many over the counter medications that have aspirins in them. These include:


Alka Seltzer
Bayer
Excedrin
Percodan
Anacin
Bufferin
Ecotrin
Fiorinal
St. Joseph'sPepto-BismolKaopectate

, Treatment will depend on how long ago you consumed the aspirin, how much you consumed, and if your poisoning is acute or chronic. Treatment may include activated charcoal (this works best if it is taken within four hours of the ingestion of aspirin), stomach pumping, whole bowel irrigation, sodium bicarbonate, hemodialysis, and/or urinary alkalinization.


It may also be necessary to treat secondary symptoms of aspirin poisoning, such as hyperthermia, seizures, and dehydration.

Purchase a cast cover.,
Use plastic bags.,
Try plastic wrap.,
Wrap a washcloth or towel near the top of the cast.",How to Take a Shower in a Cast1," This is probably the easiest means of waterproofing a cast, as it takes care of some work for you. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist about cast covers. Many companies sell covers designed to protect casts from water.Cast covers are usually long sleeves made of waterproof material. You pull these over your cast. They come in different sizes to fit a wide variety of types of casts. Their main benefit is they're far sturdier than other options, making tears less likely.
Some cast covers come with a pump that sucks air out of the cover. This forms a tight seal surrounding the cast, adding extra protection.;
, If you don't have a cover, household items can help. Sealable plastic bags can be fit over a cast to keep it safe from water.Newspaper bags, bread bags, or small trash bags usually work well. You would pull a bag over the cast and seal it on top using a rubber band or duct tape. Rubber bands may be gentler on the skin, and allow you to reuse the bag after showering.
Make sure to check the bag for any holes prior to using it to waterproof your cast.

, If you wrap plastic wrap tightly enough, it can also effectively waterproof a cast. Wrap the plastic wrap around your entire cast, making sure there are no gaps where the cast is exposed. Then, secure the plastic wrap in place with some duct tape or a rubber band.Keep in mind plastic wrap may be less effective than other methods. While it is relatively inexpensive, you may end up with gaps where the cast is exposed.

, Regardless of the method you use, this is important. Wrapping a towel or wash cloth near the top of the cast keeps water from slipping underneath the cast. Water under a cast can lead to a skin infection."

Prior to purchasing drugs online, consider the need.,
Check FDA press announcements.,
Check out the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy website.,
Check that the pharmacy you're buying from online has a licensed pharmacist available to answer your questions.,
Check the website of the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the drug.,
Consider the price.,
Upon receipt of any drugs purchased from the internet, check them:


Are they the right color?,
Avoid taking the drugs if you are suspicious about them in any way.",How to Tell if Online Drugs Are Fake," Do you really have to purchase them online or can you find a way to obtain them from a local pharmacy? In times of normal supply, going to the local drugstore is a safer option. And even in times of emergencies, such as a flu pandemic when supplies run low, there is all the more reason to take care rather than to trust just anyone selling the drugs online because unscrupulous profiteers will be selling counterfeit drugs that could compromise your health and life.;
, Go to: http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/default.htm and see if there have been recent announcements about particular pharmacy scams online. The FDA regularly publicizes counterfeit drug sales to be careful of.


If you're not in the USA, check the similar website of your federal, national, or other relevant health department website for similar updates.

, This site will tell you which online pharmacies have accreditation for their sales and can be trusted. It is found at: http://www.nabp.net/programs/accreditation/vipps/. This site will also tell you about any scams or rogue online pharmacy concerns at the current time.


Remember that pretending to be a pharmacy online is as easy as creating a website. Check the credentials of that pharmacy first!
This site also covers some countries other than the USA; check the site for details.

, The pharmacist should be based in your own country.


The site must provide a point of contact for you to talk to a pharmacist about any concerns.

, They will definitely make it clear if they are aware of any counterfeit drugs being marketed on the internet, so look for such news on their site. If you are still unsure, perhaps send them an email asking them to check the claims of the seller of the drug before purchasing.

, If it's too good to be true, then treat as a probable fake. Drug patents keep prices high, and lower prices can indicate that the seller has fake drugs, not authorized generic copies.

, If you have had the drug before, do the colors match? Or do the colors match against the colors shown for the drug on the pharmacist's or pharmaceutical company's website?
Check the shape. The same thing as with color; do the colors differ from what you're used to in this drug?
Check the batch number and the code printed on the foil of the blister pack. These should match the batch number and code printed on the outside of the packet containing the blister pack.
Are there any signs of tampering or oddities that make you wonder about the drugs on receipt of them? If you have authentic packaging from a previous pharmacy-purchased prescription, check it against the online drug purchase. There may be small but noticeable changes in fonts, advice, etc., that are not part of the manufacturer's own updating. Spelling errors, poor layout, crookedness, and sloppiness are all warning signs of a fake drug.Does it smell or taste strange?
Can it be chipped or squashed easily?
If you're still concerned, ring the manufacturer and explain that you have purchased the drugs online but you're not sure whether they're counterfeit or authentic. It is possible you will be asked to send it in for analysis. Or, take the drugs to your doctor or a pharmacist for checking.

Move the instruments.,
Wear the right clothes.,
Clean yourself up.,
Clean instruments immediately after use.,
Rinse and dry the instruments.",How to Sterilize Medical Instruments1," Instruments that have been used need to be collected and removed from the area where they were used. Take them to the area where you decontaminate things in your environment, such as a Decontamination Area in a Processing Department. This will help cut down on the chance of the contamination of the personal areas or other surfaces within the work space.


The instruments should be covered when they are being moved in covered carts, containers, or plastic bags.;
, Before you handle any contaminated instruments, you need to be dressed for the part. Workers in areas that decontaminate instruments should wear protective clothing, such as a scrubs or other moisture-resistant clothing. You should also have on show covers. plastic or rubber gloves, and a hair net or other covering.


You might also need to wear protective goggles in certain situation if the substance you are using the decontaminate the instruments splatters., Before starting to clean your instruments, you must be sterile so you won't transfer any bacteria or germs to the instruments.You should wear a sterile gown while washing the instruments. You then need to put on a sterile cap for your hair and cover your face with a mask. You need to wear protective eye covers, which will keep any potentially hazardous liquid from splashing into your eyes. Finish by putting on a pair of sterile gloves., Instruments must be cleaned immediately after use and before you attempt to sterilize them — cleaning the instruments is not the same as sterilizing them. Remove inorganic and organic debris from the instruments with a soft plastic scrub brush and medically approved detergent. Scrub each instrument well to remove all residual matter, such as blood or organic tissue. If the instrument is hinged or opens, make sure you clean the inside and outside surfaces. You don't want any residual matter to get stuck in the gears. After you scrub them, you need to run the instruments under pressured water to make sure any extra matter is cleared off. This also helps clean areas that are unable to be reached by brushes.


If you don't wash the instruments beforehand, the process may not sterilize the materials and compromise the whole endeavor.
There are solutions available to soak the instruments in. Look for a neutral pH detergents solution. Added enzymes will also make it easier to clean the surface of the instruments.
If not cleaned properly, it may affect the health of the patient.
There are automatic washers that you can use for this stage, but their use depends on the facility and location of the cleaning process., After cleaning the instruments, rinse them for 30 seconds. Place them on a clean towel and allow them to thoroughly dry. Instruments must be dry and free from mineral deposits because such substances may cause damage to the instruments or sterilizer.Again, cleaning the instruments is not meant to sterilize them. This step just prepares them for sterilization. Sterilization will destroy all microorganisms on the surface of the instrument, preventing infection.
Use caution when handling careful sharp items like scissors, blades, and other sharp implements.If an instrument is intended for single use only, usually to prevent contamination, you should dispose of it properly and do not try to wash and reuse it.

Keep your cast out of water.,
Try sponge baths instead of showers.,
Ask your doctor if a waterproof cast would be appropriate for you.",How to Take a Shower in a Cast2," Even with excellent protection, there's always a risk of water seeping through onto your cast. Strive to keep your cast away from water entirely in the aftermath of an injury.Try taking a bath instead of a shower. If you have a broken arm, it may be easier to keep your arm out of the water in a bath. You can simply place your arm on the edge of the tub while washing the rest of your body.
If you strongly prefer a shower, try to keep your cast away from running water. You may have to keep the broken limb outside of the shower during the bathing process.
However, even if you keep your cast away from the water, do not bathe or shower without a cover. Even a small amount of water can be harmful to a cast., In addition to risking getting your cast wet, navigating a shower can be difficult in the aftermath of an injury. This may be especially tricky if you have a broken leg. If possible, opt for sponge baths instead of showers.If you have a child in a cast, you may be comfortable simply sponge bathing your child until he's feeling more comfortable with his or her cast.
If you're an adult, you can try sponge bathing yourself near a sink. If you have someone you're comfortable asking, see if that person can provide a sponge bath.

, A waterproof cast can usually be safely submerged in water. If you feel like you're at a higher risk of getting your cast wet, ask your doctor about a waterproof cast.There are several types of waterproof cast materials. Ask your doctor about which material would work for your cast. Some materials may work better than others, so your doctor should be able to explain what materials would work for you.
Keep in mind a waterproof cast is not 100% waterproof. While it can withstand water better than most casts, you should still take precautions when bathing, showering, or swimming. Try to get the cast wet infrequently.
A waterproof cast may not be appropriate if you have a fracture that requires mobility to heal.

Have some kind of chair in your shower.,
Lower yourself into the shower stall.,
Use a detachable shower hose to clean yourself.,
Dry off while still seated.,
Lift yourself out of the shower stall.,
Talk to your doctor before attempting to shower with a leg cast.",How to Take a Shower in a Cast3," You will need to sit down if you're showering with a broken leg. Many people advocate lawn chairs as a good option, but you should check with your doctor beforehand. Get a suggestion from a medical professional about the type of chair to put in your home shower.Make sure your chair is secure. If a chair slips and slides in the shower, this could cause further injury.
You may have to lay a bathmat down to prevent sliding.
Have someone without a broken leg test the chair's security before you attempt to get into the shower.

, If you have a cane or walker, use that for support as you walk towards the shower. Turn your back to the shower stall and lower yourself into the chair.Use whatever you can hold onto for support. Try holding onto the sides of the shower, or the shower bar if it is secure. Keep in mind, some shower bars are not actually drilled into the wall. Test to see if the bar is secure before attempting to use it as support.
Gently sit down in the chair and situate your leg away from the shower's running water. Turn your body so you're facing the shower controls.

, This will give you a lot more control when showering seated. You can help direct the water on the body parts you want, and keep it away from your cast.If you do not have a detachable shower hose, you can try showering with the main shower head and a wet wash clot. Just be extra cautious to keep water away from your cast. You should always wrap your cast in protective covering prior to showering.

, Make sure there is a towel nearby before beginning your shower. You should dry off while you're seated. You do not want your hands and feet to be slippery as you attempt to raise yourself out of the shower., Face the opening of the shower wall and grab onto your cane, crutches, or other sources of support. Gently lift your body out of the stall.If you have a wheel chair, gently lower yourself back into the wheelchair after getting out of the shower stall.

, While this method can be safe, it's vital to talk to your doctor before trying it. Only he or she will know enough about your current condition to assess whether it's safe for you. If your doctor recommends you not lower yourself into a chair in your shower, he or she may offer other advice on safe showering practices while you're in a cast.

Dry casts after they get wet.,
Call the doctor shortly after a cast gets wet.,
Be careful even when using a fiberglass cast.",How to Take a Shower in a Cast4," In the event you get your cast wet, you should make an effort to dry it quickly. This can reduce the harm to the cast, and eliminate your risk of infection.Use a hairdryer to dry a cast. Always use the cool setting. The hot or warm setting could cause a burn.
You can also try a vacuum cleaner hose, if you do not have a hair dryer.

, A cast may have to be replaced if it gets wet. If you accidentally got water on your cast, call your doctor right away. Make an appointment as soon as possible. Water could seep under the cast, which can cause infection to the skin below., Fiberglass casts are more resistant to water, and if their surface gets wet it can usually be easily wiped off. However, water can still get under a fiberglass cast, potentially causing infection. Even if you have a fiberglass cast, it's a good idea to give your doctor a call in the event it gets wet."

Wash your hands.,
Wash or wipe the bandage and the skin around the bandage clean.,
Soften the bandage to remove it.,
Peel the bandage off.,
Wipe or rinse the skin and the affected area if needed.",How to Remove a Liquid Bandage1," This is especially important if the wound under the bandage has not had enough time to heal and poses a risk to open during the bandage removal. Dirty hands contain bacteria that can be transferred to the wound during bandage removal.Use warm water and soap to wash your hands. Be sure to remove all visible dirt on the skin as well as under the fingernails.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds, or about the time it takes to sing the “Happy Birthday” song to yourself twice.
After washing, dry your hands to remove all moisture.
If you aren’t able to wash your hands with soap and water, use a hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol.
Do not attempt to remove a liquid bandage if your doctor has advised against it.;
, Remove all visible dirt and wash the skin around the bandage with soap and water. It’s okay to wash the bandaged area too, because the soap will not irritate wounded skin that has the liquid bandage over it.


It is important to have the skin around the bandage clean, especially if the wound has not had time to heal. Once the bandage has been removed, the wound is open and susceptible to bacterial infection.
Optionally, you can remove the bandage after taking a bath to ensure your skin is clean.
Do not use alcohol, iodine or other antiseptic liquids as these may cause skin irritation., Liquid bandages are meant to stay on your skin until they come off but you can remove the bond between the bandage and your skin by softening the bandage to loosen the bond.You can soften the bandage by applying a new layer of the liquid bandage over the old one. This will help soften the bond between your skin and the bandage. Optionally, you can place a clean, wet towel over the bandage to soften it and loosen the bond between it and your skin.
You can also soften the bandage during a bath, or by giving the bandaged area a soak in a bowl of water.

, After the bond is loosened, you can peel the bandage off. Be careful not to injure the wound or skin underneath.


If the edges are not “peeling off”, take a wet cloth and wipe the bandage away. Do this before the bandage begins to harden after being softened.
You may need to gently rub the area with a towel to help remove the bandage, but do this only if it does not injure the wound underneath. Try not to drag or scrub the towel over the area.

, Be gentle not to disrupt the wound. Use the first aid steps recommended for wound care if the wound begins to bleed (see below).If the skin (or wound) appears healthy, you can leave it as is after you have removed the liquid bandage; there is no need to apply a new bandage if your skin has healed. However, if the wound has not healed, you may want to re-apply a new liquid bandage (see below).
Do not apply alcohol, iodine or other antiseptic liquids on the wound as these may cause irritation.

Sort the instruments.,
Place instruments in pouches.,
Label the pouches.",How to Sterilize Medical Instruments2," Inspect every instrument as you sort to make sure it's clean. Arrange the instruments based on what they're used for and where they need to end up. Keeping them organized is essential because each instrument has a purpose. Make sure you know what your instruments are going to be used for next before you sort them.


Organize and wrap the instruments for distribution before the autoclaving process. If you wait until afterwards and open them, they won't be sterile.

, Once you have your instruments sorted, you need to place them in sterilized pouches that can go into the autoclave. You should use special autoclave pouches designed to withstand the high temperatures of the autoclaves. The pouches have a strip of test tape that changes color when the autoclave process is effective. Take each pile of instruments you sorted and place them in as many bags as necessary.


You shouldn't have too many in a bag because it might hinder the sterilization process. Make sure that any instrument that can open, such as scissors, is left open when you put it into a pouch. The inside of the instruments need to be sterilized as well.Autoclaving in pouches is convenient because you can see the instruments you need when finished., Once you have them locked in a pouch, you need to label each one so you and others will know what the instruments are needed for. Write the instrument names, the date, and your initials on the pouches. Seal each bag securely. If the bag doesn't already have a test strip, attach one. This will show whether the sterilization was successful. You can now place the pouches in the autoclave.

Choose a cycle on the autoclave machine.,
Stack the trays.,
Load the autoclave.,
Run the autoclave.,
Check the tape.,
Keep a log.,
Run a biological control test in the autoclave every quarter.,
Check the results of the control test.",How to Sterilize Medical Instruments3," Autoclaves use high temperature steam omitted at a high pressure over a certain period of time to sterilize medical objects. This works by killing the microorganisms through time, heat, steam, and pressure. There are different settings on an autoclave machine that work for different things. Since you have bags of instruments, you should use the fast exhaust and dry cycle. This works best for wrapped items like instruments. Autoclaving fast exhaust will also sterilize glassware. , You need to place your instrument bags onto the trays that go into the autoclave machine. You should stack them in a single row. They should not be on top of one another. The steam needs to get to each instrument in each bag. You need to make sure that all instruments remain apart during the sterilization cycle. Leave space between them to allow steam to circulate., Set the trays about 1-inch apart in the machine to permit steam circulation. Don't overload the sterilizer trays. Overloading will cause inadequate sterilization and drying. You should also make sure the instruments don't shift and overlap when you set them inside the machine. Place any empty canisters upside-down to prevent accumulation of water., The autoclave machine should run for a certain period of time at a specific temperature and pressure. Wrapped instruments should be in the autoclave at 250 degrees for 30 minutes at 15 PSI or 273 degrees for 15 minutes at 30 PSI. Once the machines has run, you need to open the door a small bit to let the steam out. Then, run the drying cycle on the autoclave until the instruments are dry.


Drying should take about 30 additional minutes., After they are finished drying, take the trays of pouches out of the autoclave with sterile tongs. You now need to check the indicator tape on the pouches. If the tape turned the color according to the manufacturer's instructions, it's been exposed to 250 degree or higher heat and considered decontaminated. If the tape does not turn a different color or you see wet spots inside the pouch, then the process of autoclaving needs to be redone.If they are fine, place them aside to cool to room temperature. Once they are cooled, store them in the pouches in a warm, dry closed cabinet until they are needed. They will remain sterile as long as the pouches are dry and closed., Keep a record in a log sheet, using information such as the initials of operator, date the instruments were sterilized, the length of the cycle, the max temperature of the autoclave, and the results. For example, note if the indicator strip turned color or if you ran a biological control. Make sure you follow your company's protocol and keep records for as long as you are required.

, A biologic control run is essential to determine if the sterility process is adequate. Place a test vial of the bacteria Bacillus stearothermophilus in the center of a pouch or on a tray in the autoclave. Next, perform a normal operation. This will test to see if the machine can get rid of the Bacillus stearothermophilus in the autoclave., Keep the vial at 130-140 degrees for 24-48 hours, depending on manufacturer protocols. Compare this vial to another control vial at room temperature that was not autoclaved. The product inside the non-autoclaved vial should turn yellow to show growth. If not, there may be a problem with the sample vials. If that is the case, repeat the testing. If it still doesn't change color, it may be a bad batch of vials and you may need a whole new set.


If there is no growth on the autoclaved vial after 72 hours, then sterilization is complete. If you see yellow on the test vial, sterilization has failed. Contact the manufacturer if failure happens and do not continue to use the autoclave.This test should be run every 40 hours of use or once a month, which ever one is sooner.
The spore test should be placed in an area that is the most difficult for the steam to reach. Be aware testing standards may vary."

Understand the method.,
Start the process.,
Perform the sterilizer stage.,
Carry out the degasser stage.",How to Sterilize Medical Instruments4," Ethylene Oxide (EtO) is used for items that are moisture and heat sensitive, such as devices with plastic or electrical components that cannot withstand high temperatures. EtO helps perform antimicrobial sterilization to protect the instruments from making people sick. Studies prove that EtO is a critical sterilization technology for medical and health care purposes. It is a unique and irreplaceable sterilization method. EtO’s uses include sterilizing certain heat-sensitive and irradiation-sensitive materials, as well as some instruments and devices on-site in hospitals EtO is a chemical solution that kills all microorganisms, leading to the sterilization of the item. , When using ethylene oxide as a cleaning option, the process has three stages, which are the preconditioning stage, sterilizer stage, and degasser stage. In the preconditioning stage, the technician needs to get organisms to grow on the equipment so they can be killed and the tools can be sterilized. This is done by sending the medical equipment through a controlled temperature and humidity environment. , After the preconditioning stage, the long and complicated sterilization process starts. The whole process takes about 60 hours. The temperature control is the most important. If the temperature falls below sterilization level, the process has to start over. The vacuum and pressure of the machine is also important. The machine will not start without the perfect conditions.


Towards the end of this phase, the batch report is produced, which tells the operator if there are any issues with the process.
If the machine was set on the auto mode, the machine will move on to the degasser stage if the report shows no errors.
If there were errors, the machine will automatically stop the process and let the operator fix it before any further sterilization is done. , The final phase is the degasser stage. During this stage, any leftover particles of the EtO are removed from the tools. This is important because EtO gas is extremely flammable and harmful to humans. You must make sure this happens completely so you and any other lab workers are not harmed. This is also completed under temperature control.


Be warned that it is a very dangerous substance. Any operator, personnel, and patients that might come into contact with the gas must have training about the hazards.
It also takes longer than an autoclave."

Use a multi-use or oral digital thermometer.,
Wait 20 minutes after bathing.,
Prepare the tip of the thermometer.,
Turn on the thermometer and insert it under the tongue.,
Remove the thermometer when it beeps.,
Wash the thermometer before putting it away.",How to Take a Temperature1," Some digital thermometers are designed to be used either rectally, orally or in the armpit, while others are designed to be used specifically in the mouth. Either type of thermometer will give an accurate reading. You can find digital thermometers in the drugstore.


If you have an old glass thermometer, dispose of it instead of using it to take a temperature. Glass thermometers are considered unsafe now because they contain mercury, which is poisonous to the touch.;
, A warm bath or could affect the child's body temperature, so wait a good 20 minutes to make sure you get the most accurate possible reading., Clean it with rubbing alcohol soap and warm water, then rinse it with cool water and dry it thoroughly. , Make sure the tip is completely in the mouth and under the tongue, not up near the lips. The person's tongue should completely cover the tip of the thermometer.


If you're taking your child's temperature, either hold the thermometer in place or instruct your child to do so.
Try to move the thermometer as little as possible.

, Look at the digital display to determine whether the person has a fever. Any temperature above 100.4 °F (38.0 °C) is considered a fever, but going to the doctor right away isn't necessary unless the fever is above a certain temperature:


If the child is over 5 months old, call the doctor for a fever 101 °F (38 °C) or higher.If the person with the fever is an adult, call the doctor if it's 104 °F (40 °C) or higher.

, Use warm, soapy water and dry it thoroughly before putting it away for next time.

Tell your doctor about all medicines you are taking.,
Allow the doctor to prepare you.,
Wait while the doctor prepares the electrodes.,
Watch the doctor place the chest electrodes.,
Observe as the doctor places electrodes on your limbs.,
Wait while the EKG runs.,
Allow the doctor to remove the electrodes.,
Ask the doctor why you needed the EKG.,
Recognize normal results.,
Discuss any abnormal results with your doctor.",How to Set Up a 12 Lead Ekg," This is important because some medicines change the rate at which your heart beats and could affect the results. This includes over-the-counter medications and herbal supplements.


Do not drink cold water right before the test. You need to stay warm so that you do not shiver.;
, You may be asked to take off your shirt or put on a hospital gown. This will make it easier for the doctor to put the electrodes directly onto your skin.If your skin is dirty, the doctor may clean and wipe the areas where the electrodes will go.
If you have hair on your chest, arms, or legs where the doctor wants to put the leads (electrodes), you may be shaved first. This will help the leads stick correctly., The 12 lead EKG uses 10 electrodes. They will be put directly onto your skin. They may feel slightly cold, but they will not hurt. The electrodes measure your body’s electricity. They do not put electricity into your body.The doctor may use gel, spray, or tape to fix them in place and create a good connection.

, There will be six chest electrodes which must be placed as follows:Electrode 1 will go to the right of the sternum in the fourth intercostal space. The intercostal space is the space between the ribs.
Electrode 2 will go to the left of the sternum in the fourth intercostal space.
Electrode 3 will be in between electrodes 2 and 4.
Electrode 4 will go on midclavicular line in the fifth intercostal space. The midclavicular line is a vertical line that goes through the middle of the collarbone.
Electrode 5 is horizontally level with electrode 4 in the anterior axillary line. The anterior axillary line runs down your body from the collarbone, 3/4ths of the distance from the middle of your collarbone to the end.
Electrode 6 is horizontally level with electrode 4 in the mid-axillary line. The midaxillary line runs down your side from your armpit to your waist.

, The other four electrodes will go on your arms and legs and do not have to be placed as precisely. The doctor will likely avoid areas with a lot of hair, protruding bones, or muscles, but will place them as follows:One electrode on each arm between your wrist and your shoulder.
One electrode on each leg between your ankle and your thigh.

, Chances are the doctor will just ask you to lie still. In order to get accurate results, it is important that you do not move or shiver.You will need to lie flat on your back so that you are relaxed with all of your limbs supported.
The doctor may ask you to hold your breath briefly during the test.
As the test runs, you may be able to see the results displayed on the monitor. If so, you may see a graph displaying a peak when your heart beats.

, When the test is over, the doctor will pull the leads off you. This will also not hurt. You may have a slight red mark from the suction afterwards, but this should go away after a few minutes.


The doctor will inform you that the test is over and that you can get dressed again.
It may be possible to learn what the results are immediately.

, The doctor may have performed the EKG as part of a regular check-up or because he was concerned about symptoms you have. The doctor is more likely to do an EKG if:You have a history of heart disease in your family.
You have heart disease, have a pacemaker, or are on medications that could affect your heart.
You will have surgery.
You have reported chest pain, having a pounding heartbeat, breathing difficulties, or fatigue.
Your doctor heard abnormal sounds when listening to your heart.

, If the EKG shows no abnormalities or problems you will get the following information about your heart beat:A heart rate that is neither too fast nor too slow. For an adult it should be between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Athletes who are in extremely good shape may have a slightly lower heart beat.
A steady rhythm. Your heartbeat should be regular and steady when you are at rest. There should be no missing beats and no extra beats.

, If your results come back showing an abnormal heart rate, she may send you to a cardiologist for additional tests. Possible abnormal results may indicate:Tachycardia. This condition occurs when your heart beats too quickly.
Bradycardia. This occurs when your heart beats too slowly.
Arrhythmia. A heart arrhythmia occurs when your heart beats irregularly. This can happen due to problems with the electrical signals controlling the heartbeat or as a side effect of medications such as beta blockers, amphetamines, or other drugs.
A previous or current heart attack. The EKG may reveal areas of your heart that have been damaged.
An enlarged heart with areas that are thickened.
Valve problems.
An insufficient blood supply to part of the heart.

You can also use a clean toothbrush with soft bristles instead.;
, Ask your healthcare professional about specially formulated disinfectant sprays that are water-based. These can be used to clean as well as protect your device from contamination for up to five days.Avoid alcohol-based products as alcohol tends to break down the material of the piece faster. , Picks are small tools that contain a wire loop on the end that assists in pulling earwax from the device.They are inserted into the receiver tube in order to remove debris that is unable to be removed by wiping alone. They can be purchased at your local drugstore, online, or from your healthcare professional.

, Soft and clean tissue or cloth can be used to wipe down the outer surface areas of our device. Make sure that disposable tissues do not contain lotions or aloe vera.Additionally, if you use reusable cleaning cloths, make sure you clean the cloths regularly to avoid redistributing wax and debris onto the device. Tissue or cloths can be purchased at your local drugstore or supermarket.

, MultiTools are versatile devices that combine many tools in one. Not only do they come with brushes and picks, but they also come with magnets to assist in the removal of batteries.They are usually available online or from healthcare professionals.

, Hearing aid dryers are used to remove excess water after cleaning, or to prevent moisture-related problems. Hearing aids should be stored in a dryer overnight to keep them safe and dry. Dryers range in price from $5 to $90 and can be purchased online or from a healthcare professional., The first step is to make a quick visual examination of your device for visible buildup. Most hearing aids have specific parts where earwax tends to accumulate such as filters and wax guards, sound bores and hearing aid tips, and tubing.Filters and wax guards offer built-in protection from ear wax. They are designed to be easily removed by the user and should be inspected daily for wax buildup.The sound bore or tip of the hearing aid is where the sound exits. This part can easily become clogged and should be inspected daily for wax buildup.
The tubing connects the hearing aid to the ear mold. Wax can often accumulate here and the blockage requires special tools to dislodge the wax build-up. , The hearing aid should be wiped each morning with a soft cloth or tissue. It is best to wipe down hearing aids in the morning (not at night) so that the wax has had a chance to dry and will thus be easier to remove. Avoid wiping debris into the microphone ports., The wax pick should be used to remove wax buildup from the receiver or speaker of the aid. The small wire loop should be inserted into the opening of the speaker until resistance is felt. Scoop out wax from the opening until all is removed., For BTE aids, disconnect the ear mold from the hearing aid by pinching the tubing with one hand and the pinching the ear hook with the other. Twist and pull the tubing from the ear hook, making sure that you are near the seam between the two., Once the ear molds are removed from your BTE device, they should be soaked for 10 minutes in warm, soapy water. After 10 minutes, dry with a clean, soft towel, and use a dryer to remove excess water from the tubing.Do not soak the hearing aids—only the ear molds.

, Once the ear molds are completely dry, reassemble by twisting the tubing onto the ear molds so that the wing of the ear mold is oriented oppositely of the sound opening., Whether using a cloth or specific tools, be sure to rid your device of dust and debris daily. Clean hearing aids and parts in the morning to ensure that wax is dry and easier to remove.

, Remove your hearing aid batteries nightly and store in a dehumidifier or dryer in order to protect them from moisture. MultiTools usually provide a device to assist in the removal of batteries.If you don’t have a dryer for storage, leave the batteries in the hearing aid and leave the compartment open over night to dry out any moisture.
Heat tends to damage batteries so choose to store them at room temperature., Insert hearing aids only after you have applied makeup, hairspray and other products to avoid buildup of foreign matter. Keep hearing aids in a safe, dry location (such as a dehumidifier or dryer) when not in use., Visit your healthcare professional every 3-6 months to do hearing checks and to check the functionality of your device. Never attempt to do repairs on your own."

Peel the bandage off.,
Wipe or rinse the skin and the affected area if needed.",How to Remove a Liquid Bandage2," This is especially important if the wound under the bandage has not had enough time to heal and poses a risk to open during the bandage removal. Dirty hands contain bacteria that can be transferred to the wound during bandage removal.Use warm water and soap to wash your hands. Be sure to remove all visible dirt on the skin as well as under the fingernails.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds, or about the time it takes to sing the “Happy Birthday” song to yourself twice.

Optionally, you can remove the bandage after taking a bath to ensure your skin is clean.
Do not use alcohol, iodine or other antiseptic liquids as these may cause skin irritation., Acetone, the most common type of nail polish remover, will help soften and lift the liquid bandage from your skin. However, it can irritate some people’s skin, so try the softening method first if you have sensitive skin., Make sure the acetone gets onto the whole bandage. You may need to saturate the bandage with acetone to soften it.

, After the bond is loosened, you can peel the bandage off. Be careful not to injure the wound or skin underneath.


If the edges are not “peeling off”, take a wet cloth and wipe the bandage away. Do this before the bandage begins to harden after being softened.
You may need to gently rub the area with a towel to help remove the bandage, but do this only if it does not injure the wound underneath. Try not to drag or scrub the towel over the area.

Wash and dry the affected area.,
Apply the liquid bandage over the wound.,
Allow the bandage to dry for a few minutes.,
Keep the liquid bandage dry.",How to Remove a Liquid Bandage3," The skin and wound area must be completely dry before liquid bandage can be applied. Pat dry with a soft towel to avoid disturbing the wound.If the wound is bleeding, stop the bleeding first before applying the bandage. Press the wound with a towel and hold the pressure until the bleeding has stopped.
You can also press an ice pack wrapped in a cloth or towel over the wound to reduce blood flow and stop the bleeding.Elevating the wound above the level of your heart can also reduce bleeding.Liquid bandages should only be applied over minor wounds, such as superficial cuts, abrasions and scrapes that are not deep and do not bleed heavily. If the wound is deep or bleeds heavily for over 10 minutes (regardless of attempts to stop the bleeding), seek medical attention immediately., Use a spreading motion from one end of the wound to the other. Use one continuous movement until you have covered the wound completely.If the wound is a cut, bring the edges of the wound together with your fingers to help seal the wound.
Do not place the liquid bandage inside the wound. It should be applied only on the surface of the affected area.

, This allows the adhesion or bond between the bandage and skin to develop.


Do not apply another layer of liquid bandage over the old one after it has dried. This will loosen the old bandage.

, Although it is waterproof, you should not let it sit in water as this will remove the bandage. You can still take a shower or go swimming as long as you are not soaking in the water for an extended time.Do not apply any lotions, oils, gels, or ointments over the affected area. This will weaken the bond between the liquid bondage and your skin.
Avoid scratching the site as this may remove the liquid bandage.
The liquid bandage will fall off naturally in 5 to 10 days.

Soak the bandage in water.,
Use oils or soaps to weaken and lubricate the adhesive.,
Lubricate extra-sticky bandages even more.,
Dissolve the adhesive with alcohol.",How to Remove a Band Aid Painlessly1," You’ve probably had the misfortune of coming across someone’s used bandage floating in the gutter of a public swimming pool, and therefore are aware that exposure to water weakens a bandage’s adhesion to skin.


No, don’t go to your public pool. Soak in the bathtub for a bit, and then try removing the bandage. A leisurely shower may work as well.
You can also just apply a wet compress (such as a clean rag soaked in warm water) to the bandage and wait for it to soak through.;
, People swear by different products -- olive oil, petroleum jelly, baby shampoo, or baby oil, to name a few -- but the process is similar regardless. Try different variations and see what works best for you and your family.


Use a cotton ball, cotton swab, or just your finger to massage the product into the adhesive areas of the bandage. Work it in and allow it to saturate those areas of the bandage.
Peel a corner of the bandage up to see if the adhesion has been weakened. If not, keep working in the oil or soap.
If so, peel away the rest of the bandage in a quick motion. Use your other hand to gently press the surrounding skin down, if necessary.
One tip for kids is adding food coloring to baby oil so that you can “paint” the mixture onto the bandage with cotton swabs. Make it a fun experience instead of a worrisome one., Instead of yanking off a stubbornly-stuck bandage quickly, weaken the adhesive as mentioned in the last step, peel up a corner, then apply moisturizing lotion to the contact point between skin and bandage as you continue to slowly pull it away., You can also use the lubricating technique with rubbing alcohol. The adhesive should slowly but surely dissolve, and any adhesive remaining on the skin can be rubbed away with the saturated cotton ball / swab.


There are also adhesive removal products marketed for bandage removal. Check medical or surgical supply stores if not available at your drugstore."

Learn the process.,
Start the process.,
Load the bags.,
Sterilize the tools.",How to Sterilize Medical Instruments5," Dry heat is a process used on oils, petroleum, and powders. Also, any items that are sensitive to moisture use dry heat. Dry heat is used to slowly burn the microorganisms away and is typically done in an oven. There are two types of dry heat, a static-air type and a forced air type.


The static air is a much slower process. It takes longer to raise the temperature of the air in the chamber to sterilization levels because it has coils that heat up.
The forced air process uses a motor that circulates the air inside the oven. The heats range from 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 150 minutes or longer to 340 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour., Similar to autoclaving, you begin the dry heat method by washing your hands and applying non-sterile gloves. Next, wash instruments to remove any debris or matter that might be left behind. This ensures that the items that get put into the ovens are as clean as possible and will not have non-sterile materials left behind on them. , Just like with autoclaving, the medical tools are placed into bags during the sterilization process. Place the cleaned instruments into sterilization pouches. Seal up each pouch so it is airtight. This is important because wet or damaged packages will not be sterilized during the process. You need to make sure the bags have temperature sensitive tape or an indicator strip. If they don't, you should add one.


The tape helps you ensure the products are sterilized by reaching the temperature necessary for the sterilization., Once you have all the tools in pouches, you need to load the pouches into the dry heat oven. Do not overload the oven because the tools will not get sterilized correctly. Once the pouches are loaded, start the cycle. The sterilization process will not start until the chamber is at the right temperature.


Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for loading the ovens.
After the cycle is complete, remove the instruments. Check the indicator strips to make sure the items were sterilized. Take the tools and store them in the safe, clean, dry place in order to protect them from dust and dirt."
"
Use microwaves.,
Try hydrogen peroxide.,
Sterilize with ozone gas.,
Consider chemical solutions.,
Try formaldehyde gas.",How to Sterilize Medical Instruments6," Microwaves are also used for sterilization. The non-ionizing radiation destroys the microorganisms on the surface of the tools. The microwave stream process is performed on the tools and the heat is used to kill the organisms. It can be used quickly and reliably.


You can also use this method at home for things like baby bottles., Hydrogen peroxide use in the form of a plasma or vapor can be used to sterilize. The plasma is made into a cloud of hydrogen peroxide with help from a strong electric or magnetic field. The sterilization phase of hydrogen peroxide is made up of two phases, the diffusion phase and the plasma phase.


For the diffusion phase, put the non-sterile object into a vacuum chamber where 6 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide is injected and vaporized. For 50 minutes, hydrogen peroxide is diffused into the chamber.
In the plasma phase, 400 watts of radiofrequency is applied to the chamber, making the hydrogen peroxide a plasma that is made of hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl radicals. These help sterilize the product. The whole process takes about one hour., Ozone gas is a gas generated from oxygen and is used to sterilize medical supplies. The ozone method of sterilization is a newer method that involves a lower temperature. With help from a converter, the oxygen from a hospital source is converted into ozone. To sterilize, a 6-12% concentration of ozone gas is continually pumped through the chamber holding the supplies.


The cycle time is about 4.5 hours with a temperature of 85 degrees to 94 degrees Fahrenheit., Chemical solutions can be used to sterilize instruments by soaking in the solution for the required period of time. The chemical agents are peracetic acid, formaldehyde, and gluaraldehyde.


When using any of these chemicals, remember to use a well ventilated area with gloves, eye cover, and gowns or aprons for your own protection.
Peracetic acid should soak the products for 12 minutes in temperatures of 122 degrees to 131 degrees Fahrenheit. You can only use the solution once.
Gluaraldehyde requires 10 hours of soaking after adding an activating chemical that comes with the bottle., Formaldehyde gas is used for the products that cannot stand heat too high without warping and other damage. In this process, the initial vacuum process removes the air from the chamber. The instruments are loaded and then the steam is let into the chamber. The vacuum continues to remove the air from the chamber as it heats up. Formaldehyde gases are then mixed with steam and pulsed into the chamber. The formaldehyde is slowly released from the chamber and replaced with steam and air.


The conditions have to be ideal for this process with humidity at 75% to 100% and temperatures from 140 degrees to 176 degrees Fahrenheit.
Formaldehyde gas is not the most reliable, but it is suggested if EtO is unavailable. It is an old technique that dates back to 1820.
It is not often suggested for sterilization because of the gases, smell, and complex processes involved compared to the others available."

Use a multi-use digital thermometer.,
Turn on the thermometer and place it in the armpit.,
Remove the thermometer when it beeps.,
Wash the thermometer before putting it away.",How to Take a Temperature2," Look for a digital thermometer designed to be used either rectally, orally or in the armpit. This way you can take the axillary temperature first, and if a high temperature is indicated, you can try a different method as well.


If you have an old glass thermometer, dispose of it instead of using it to take a temperature. Glass thermometers are considered unsafe now because they contain mercury, which is poisonous to the touch.

, Lift the arm, insert the thermometer, then lower the arm so the tip of the thermometer is snug in the middle of the armpit. The entire tip should be covered., Look at the digital display to determine whether the person has a fever. Any temperature above 100.4 °F (38.0 °C) is considered a fever, but going to the doctor right away isn't necessary unless the fever is above a certain temperature:


If the child is over 5 months old, call the doctor for a fever 101 °F (38 °C) or higher.
If the person with the fever is an adult, call the doctor if it's 104 °F (40 °C) or higher.

, Use warm, soapy water and dry it thoroughly before putting it away for next time.

Use a multi-use or rectal digital thermometer.,
Wait 20 minutes after bathing or swaddling.,
Prepare the tip of the thermometer.,
Position the child comfortably.,
Turn on the thermometer.,
Hold the child's buttocks apart and gently insert the thermometer.,
Once the beep sounds, carefully remove the thermometer.,
Wash the thermometer before putting it away.",How to Take a Temperature3," Some digital thermometers are designed to be used either rectally, orally or in the armpit, while others are designed to be used specifically in the rectum. Either type of thermometer will give an accurate reading. You can find digital thermometers in the drugstore.


Look for a model that has a wide handle and a sip that can't be inserted too far into the rectum. This will make the process easier and help prevent you from inserting the thermometer too far.If you have an old glass thermometer, dispose of it instead of using it to take a temperature. Glass thermometers are considered unsafe now because they contain mercury, which is poisonous to the tough.

, A warm bath or a snug swaddling session could affect the child's body temperature, so wait a good 20 minutes to make sure you get the most accurate possible reading., Clean it with rubbing alcohol soap and warm water, then rinse it with cool water and dry it thoroughly. Cover the tip with petroleum jelly to make it easier to insert., Place the child either tummy down across your lap, or tummy up on a firm surface. Choose the position that's most comfortable for the child and makes it easiest for you to access the rectum.

, Most digital thermometers have a clearly labeled button you press to power on the device. Allow a moment or two for it to get set to take the temperature.

, Use one hand to hold the child's buttocks apart and the other to insert the thermometer about three quarters of an inch to once inch inside. Stop if any resistance is felt.Keep the thermometer in place by holding it between your first and middle fingers. Meanwhile, keep your other hand hand firmly but gently on the child's bottom to prevent squirming.

, Read the thermometer to determine whether the child has a fever. A temperature of 100.4 °F (38.0 °C) or higher indicates a fever.


If the child is under 5 months old, call the doctor for a fever 100.4 °F (38.0 °C) or higher.
If the child is over 5 months old, call the doctor for a fever 101 °F (38 °C) or higher.
If the person with the fever is an adult, call the doctor if it's 104 °F (40 °C) or higher.

, Use warm, soapy water as well as rubbing alcohol to cleanse the tip thoroughly.

Commit to creating a plan.,
Look at your daily routine, ask yourself some important questions.,
Get the medic bracelet sorted.,
Prepare an emergency kit.,
Locate in advance several shelters that you can get to on your own.,
Teach someone how to use medical equipment.,
Prepare for emergency care for the elderly person's pets.",How to Design a Disaster Preparedeness Plan for Older Citizens," Make the time, take the time to really review both your own and your family's needs. Consider the possibility of being left alone, on your own for some time. It is a reality that even family members cannot or will not help you for various reasons, from fear to stubbornness, from inability to reach you to injury or even death.;
, These should include asking: ""What do I need?"", ""What do I use everyday?"". Your answers will tell you what to prepare for, your answers will tell you what is necessary to put in your kit over and above the standard requirements advised by disaster advisory bodies in your region. Some special things to consider in relation to senior persons include:


Is the person on medication, does the person have prostheses? Will the pharmacy allow you to order a supply of medication in advance for this person? Or, is there a need to apportion or ration some of the medication supply the family has already?
Is the medication in liquid or powder form; will you need clean water or certain types of food to take the medication properly? Think about these things. Perhaps it is a good idea to place a note in large font in a plastic bag with the medication, stating its side effects and the administration guidelines. Make sure to include to state any allergies or side effects. If the medication requires refrigeration, maybe keep some pre-frozen packets ready to hand and an ice chest, to maintain a required lower temperature. Think about these details in advance of the need.

, If you need a medic alert bracelet, get one.

, In creating an emergency kit, include items such as safe stable footwear, hat, glasses, gloves, water, non-perishable food, a manual can opener, and medical first aid supplies. In addition, it is helpful to have to hand: contact lenses, dentures, bandages, scissors, medical tape, antihistamine, a handy can opening twist for people who lack strength, etc. Custom fit your emergency kit to personally fit the elderly person's needs. Do you have or need a light weight sweater? Don't forget about storing extra money - there is no assurance that the electricity and computers will work in a disaster when electricity goes down - if so, will that make your credit or debit card use inoperable?

, There may be no public transportation and you and your family might have to get there on foot, even with some climbing over rubble. How will you circumvent that possibility especially with an elderly and/or infirm person in tow? Create a support network of like-minded people. Encourage one another to complete each of these goals. Have on hand stretchers, wheelchairs, etc. that are accessible to the community in times of need.

, If there are medical machines required for an elderly person, show a reliable person how to operate and maintain them so that there is someone else besides yourself or the elderly person able to do this.

, These will be a source of distress if injured and a source of comfort when kept safe.

, Paying attention to your breath will signal your body to let go of stress and helps you get ready to pull off the band-aid., Contrary to what many think, ripping the band-aid off as fast as you can can be less painful for some.Exhaling while you pull the band-aid off can trigger your body to relax rather than tense up. Likewise, the faster you pull, the faster your discomfort will be over.
If the skin is really irritated, apply a chunk of ice or a cold compress to the area to help soothe the skin.

Open the sterile glove package.,
Pull the sterile glove wrapper open like a book.,
Open the sterile paper wrapper using the one inch folds.,
Grab the first glove.,
Step back and pull the glove onto your dominate hand.,
Grab the second glove.,
Insert your non-dominant hand into the glove.,
Smooth the gloves out.,
Check the gloves for rips.",How to Put on Sterile Gloves," The gloves should fit but not be too tight or too loose. Gloves that are too small can easily rip and feel uncomfortable and gloves that are too big will make it hard to perform a task.


Sizes normally start at 5.5 and go up by increments of .5 until size 9. The average size is 7.5.;
, Having a ring, watch, or bracelet on while wearing sterile gloves will contaminate the glove and also presents a risk of ripping the glove and/or getting in the way of the task.


Put jewelry in a safe place.

, Use the proper medical technique to wash your hands


In some circumstances, a sink may not be available, so an alcohol-based hand-rub is acceptable.

, It is important to stay standing the entire time to avoid contamination.


Standing will help keep your arms above your waist.
Anything below your waist is considered contaminated.

, Open the sterile glove package on a sterile, flat surface to prevent contamination of the gloves


Peel the corner of the package until the sterile paper wrapper, which contains the gloves, falls out. Let the sterile paper wrapper drop on the sterile surface.
Discard or set aside the packaging the sterile paper wrapper was inside.You do not need it anymore.

,


Do not touch the one inch folds yet.

,


Caution: Everything is sterile except for the one inch folds.
Turn the sterile paper so it is in front of you. The L and R symbols should be facing you.
The paper wrapper is sterile except for one inch (2.5cm) all around the edges.
Using the one inch non-sterile field, open the paper wrapper all the way. You should now see two gloves in the middle of the sterile field. The tops of both gloves are turned down to form a cuff.

,


Caution: Do not touch the outside of the glove with your ungloved hand. Keep your hands above your waist at all times.
Using your non-dominant hand, grasp the glove for the dominant hand by the fold of the cuff using your fingers.
Most people use their thumb and index finger to grasp the glove.

, Allow the cuff to stay turned back on itself for now.

,


Caution: Do not touch the inside of the cuff with your gloved hand because that area is not sterile.
Using your dominant hand which now has the glove on, place your fingers under the cuff of the other glove.

,


Caution: Remember to keep your hands above your waist and do not touch the inside of the second glove with your already gloved hand.
Ease the glove on by pushing on the inside fold of the cuff.
Turn back the cuff.

,


Turn back the cuff of your first glove without touching the inside of your glove.
Use your gloved hands to adjust the gloves to a comfortable position.

, Turn your hand and look to see if there are any visible rips or tears.


If you see a tear, a new pair of gloves must be applied.

Don’t avoid removing a bandage by not using one.,
Prepare wounds properly for bandaging.,
Consider moistening the wound to inhibit sticking.,
Cover the wound with a bandage.Choose a bandage that is large enough so that the pad (the part that isn’t sticky) covers the entire wound with a little room to spare.,
Get out your razor, if necessary.,
Have faith in medical science.",How to Remove a Band Aid Painlessly2," One of those bits of “old-time” wisdom that still circulates today is the idea that it is better to clean a small cut, then let it “air out” and scab over. Like putting butter on a burn or tilting your head back during a nosebleed, however, this is false.


Small wounds actually heal better in a moist environment, in which blood vessels regenerate faster and inflammation-causing cells multiply more slowly. So, preventing scab formation actually aids the healing process.It may be no surprise that the company behind Band-Aids promotes covering cuts and scrapes instead of airing them out, but they have science on their side., Sometimes the worst part of pulling away a bandage is not the sticky adhesive, but dried blood / scabbing that pulls away with the bandage and reopens the wound. Proper preparation can make this less likely.Stop the bleeding of a minor cut or scrape by applying pressure with gauze, a paper towel, a clean cloth, etc. Apply gentle pressure for up to 15 minutes, until all bleeding has stopped.
For a large cut or wound, an excessively dirty wound, or a wound that won’t stop bleeding, get medical help.
Rinse the area with clean water and gently clean the wound with soap and water. Rinse again and pat dry with a clean cloth, etc. Don’t use hydrogen peroxide or one of those old wound cleaners your grandfather swore by -- just plain old soap and water. Hydrogen peroxide and iodine can irritate an injury.

, Antibiotic ointments have shown little evidence in helping wounds heal faster, but they do help keep the wound moist and make sticking less likely upon bandage removal.That said, plain old petroleum jelly will provide the same moistening / lubricating benefit.Apply a small dab only over the wound itself, so the bandage will stick where it should.

, Try not to touch the pad when applying to reduce infection chances.


Especially when wrapping a bandage around a finger (or a larger bandage wrap around an arm or leg), make it tight enough to stay in place and prevent a gap between pad and wound, but not so tight that it hampers blood flow. If your finger tingles or turns purple-ish, it’s too tight.
Apply a new bandage if the old one gets saturated with water or dirty.

, If you need to apply a bandage to a hairy area -- for a man, an arm or leg, or even chest or back -- you may want to prevent the inevitable pain of the bandage being stuck to your hair by removing the hair first.


Use warm water, a fresh, clean razor, and don’t shave over the wound itself.
Unless you want to have patchy hairless spots along with your small scars, you probably should try the other bandage removal procedures discussed in this article before resorting to this step.

, Bandage removal is not just an annoyance -- some 1.5 million people in the U.S. annually, mostly infants and the elderly with sensitive skin, suffer scarring or irritation from bandage removal. However, new bandages are being developed that sandwich a “quick-release” layer between the backing and dissolvable adhesive.So, perhaps painful bandage removals will be a thing of the past soon.

Wash your hands with soap and clean water.,
Clean the area around the band-aid.,
Work at one corner of the bandage little-by-little.,
Lift it a little, tug at it a little more, then rest and repeat until the bandage comes off completely.",How to Remove a Band Aid2," You should have clean hands whenever you are touching the area around your band-aid to prevent the spread of bacteria and possible infection.Use clean water from a tap to wet your hands.

Gently pat the area dry with a clean, dry washcloth.

, It’s important to move slowly here and are not too ambitious about how much you peel up. The less you peel, the less it will hurt.


If the band-aid is in a hairy part of your body, ripping it off slowly may be more comfortable.
It can help to get a fingernail up under the edge of the band-aid to tease the adhesive away from the skin.

, This part can feel like it’s taking forever, but in order to reduce discomfort, you need to work slowly.


Take breaks for as long as you need to in between tugs. This gives your pain reflex a chance to calm down.
This process takes extra patience, but you are getting there, slowly but surely.
How many times you repeat these steps depends on how big the band-aid is, and how much you are able to peel back each time.
Take your time, breathe, and stay relaxed as you work the band-aid off.
Remember, if you get bored, though, you can always switch to the quick rip method.

Gently pat the area dry with a clean, dry washcloth.

, You’ll need a firm grip to keep consistent tension and angle for this method.


This method may work especially well for waterproof band-aids., Pulling parallel to your skin encourages the adhesive to release rather than stick to your skin.


It is normal for the band-aid stretch slightly with this method.
This can be an awkward movement, but when you get the hang of it, you’ll feel the adhesive release from your skin.

, Consistent tension keeps the band-aid from sagging and re-sticking to your skin.


For the final bit, you may have to pull up more vigorously and finish with a quick jerk up and away from your skin.
It will help if you have “follow through” with your movement so you don’t get stuck at the very end.
Keep this movement as steady and smooth as you can so you don’t prolong any discomfort.
Alternatively, you can peel the band-aid off diagonally across the wound. Some people find they are better at controlling the band-aid with this method.
The tingling feeling you have on your skin where the band-aid was should subside shortly.

Gently pat the area dry with a clean, dry washcloth.

, This is the most efficient way to get the most oil onto the adhesive part of the band-aid.


This will take 1-2 minutes depending on how big your cotton ball is.
Be sure to protect your clothing and other items around you from accidental drips.
Alternatively, you can also use baby-oil instead of olive oil.
Another option is to use a mixture of lotion and baby-oil applied with a cotton swab to achieve similar results
If you don’t have either of these oils on hand, you can also soak the band-aid and surrounding area in a bowl of clean, warm water until the adhesive dissolves. This option may work better for fabric types of band-aids.

, The oil will help to dissolve the part of the band-aid that sticks to your skin so it can slip off with minimal effort.How long this takes depends on the size, location, and strength of the adhesive on the band-aid.
Keep the oil from getting on the cotton underside of the band-aid so it doesn’t irritate your wound.

, This should require little effort and no pain. If it's still sticking, try leaving the oil on for a little longer.

;
, There are several possible types, including:








Push and turn down - the lid will have an arrow pointing down or a label that says Push.
Squeeze the sides and turn - the lid will have grooves around the lid to help you squeeze and turn it easily.
Push down the tab and turn - the lid will have a small raised tab that says Push on it and possibly arrows to indicate a turning motion.
Line up the arrows - the lid will have an arrow pointing downward and another arrow on the lip of the container pointing upward.

, Because each child proof container has it's own particular locking mechanism, it's important to use the right motions to open it. If you are not mobile enough to open the lid without an additional method, disregard this step.









Push and turn down - push the lid downward and push it until it rotates and opens.
Squeeze the sides and turn - use the grooves around the lid to get a good grip on it, then squeeze and turn the lid at the same time until it opens.
Push down the tab and turn - use your palm to push down the tab and turn the lid until it opens.
Line up the arrows - rotate the lid until the arrow on the lid is in line with the arrow on the lip of the container. Then, lift the lid off the container.

Orient the top of the mask properly.,
Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards.,
Placing the mask on your face.,
Adjust the nose piece.,
Tie the lower band of the mask if needed.,
Fit the mask to your face and under your chin.",How to Put on a Medical Mask1," Before touching a clean medical mask, wash your hand thoroughly with both soap and water.Once you’ve applied soap to your wet hands, you should rub your hands together to wash them for at least 20 seconds before rinsing them off.Always use a clean paper towel to dry your hands, and then place that paper towel into a trash bin. Before you throw it away you may want to use that paper towel to open/close a door after you’ve washed your hands.;
, Once you’ve taken a new (unused) medical mask from the box, check it to ensure it doesn’t contain any defects, holes or tears in the material. If the mask has defects, holes or tears, throw it away and select another new (unused) mask from the box., In order for the mask to fit as close to your skin as possible, the top portion of the mask will have a bendable, but stiff, edge that can be moulded around your nose. Ensure this bendable side is facing upwards before applying the mask to your face., The inside of most medical masks are white in colour, while the outside has a colour of some sort. Before applying the mask to your face, make sure the white side of the mask is facing towards your face., There are many types of medical masks available, each with different methods of attaching the mask to your head.Ear Loops — Some masks have two ear loops on either side of the mask. These loops are normally made of an elastic material so they can be stretched. Pick up this type of mask by the loops, put one loop around one ear and then put the other loop around your other ear.

Ties or Straps — Some masks comes with pieces of fabric that are tied around the back of your head. Most masks with ties come with an upper and lower ties or straps. Pick up the mask by the upper ties, place the ties around the back of your head and attach them together with a bow.

Bands — Some masks come with two elastic bands that are placed over and around the back of your head (as opposed to around your ears). Hold the mask in front of your face, pull the top band over the top of your head and place it around the crown of your head. Then pull the bottom band over the top of your head and place it at the base of your skull.

, Now that the medical mask is in place on your head and face, use your index finger and thumb to pinch the bendable portion of the top edge of the mask around the bridge of your nose., If you’re using a mask with bands that tie on the top and bottom, you can now tie the bottom band around the base of your skull. Because adjusting the bendable nose piece can impact the fit of the mask, it is best to wait until after the nose piece is in place before tying the bottom straps.If you’ve already tied the bottom straps, you may need to re-tie them tighter if needed.

, Once the mask is completely secured, adjust it to ensure it covers your face and mouth, and so the bottom edge is under your chin."

Decide if it is time for removal.,
Explain the procedure to the patient.,
Position the patient in a semi-Fowler's position.,
Wash your hands and put on gloves.,
Put on an apron and face shield.,
Place a pad to collect drainage.,
Prepare a new dressing and tape for easy placement.,
Remove the chest tube dressing carefully.,
Change gloves after removing the dressing.,
Clamp the tube using a rubber-tipped Kelly clamp, and discontinue suction.,
Cut the anchor suture that holds the tube in place.,
Instruct the patient to perform the Valsalva maneuver.,
Remove the tube swiftly and gently while the patent is performing the Valsalva maneuver.,
Close the purse-string suture immediately, if present, and observe the site for escaping air.,
Cover the site immediately with an appropriate dressing.,
Dispose of waste properly.,
Monitor the patent’s respiratory condition.,
Perform an x-ray to make sure the lung is properly functioning.",How to Pull a Chest Tube," A medical professional will decide when it is time for a chest tube to be taken out. The following is a list of factors to consider.


The chest tube has been used for about a week. Long use of chest tubes can increase the chance of infection.
The amount of fluid drained has decreased substantially, usually to less than 200 mL 24 hours.
Respiration has returned to normal. The patient is no longer short of breath, breathing rate has returned to normal, and the chest rises symmetrically upon air intake.
X-rays (or other tests) show an absence of air or fluid in the pleural cavity.;
, It is important that the patient understands what he will need to do during the procedure, such as the Valsalva maneuver. The patient may also be nervous about pain. They will remember the pain of insertion (if they were conscious), and chest tubes can also be quite painful while inserted. It will be important to reassure the patient, as the removal of a chest tube is usually less painful than going in.

, Lay the patient on his back and elevate the head of the bed by a small amount (usually about 30o). The patient's knees may be flat or may be elevated by a small amount. The patient's arms should be relaxed and out of the way.

, Washing your hands and wearing gloves are critically important in reducing the chance of spreading diseases such as infection.



Warning: Use latex-free gloves if the patent is allergic to latex.

, This is done to protect yourself from any splatter or drainage, as removing a chest tube can be a messy procedure. A face shield consists of a clear, plastic panel that straps around the forehead and covers the face. A surgery apron is a thin plastic gown that straps around the chest and covers the upper half of the body.

, A pad will protect the surroundings from drainage. Disposable pads often contain an absorbent fabric layer (to soak up liquid) and a plastic layer (to protect the covered surfaces). The plastic layer should go down. Several pads may be needed.

, Attach a single piece of tape to a prepared dressing and lay it in a convenient location. Also have strips of tape ready to use and lay them sticky-side up. Having the dressing ready to use will reduce the time it takes to cover the hole after the chest tube is removed. The hole must be sealed quickly to keep air from entering the pleural space, which could cause the lung to collapse.

, Make sure to avoid tugging on the chest tube. The dressing usually consists of a soft bulky interior (to seal and protect the area) and tape around the edges. Peeling away the tape from several sides will release the dressing gently.

, This is done to maintain a sterile environment, as the old gloves are contaminated from removing the dressing.

, This is to stop any air flow from entering or leaving the pleural space. The rubber tips help prevent damage to the chest tube. The Kelly clamp also locks itself in place using a gripping mechanism near the handles.

,



Warning: Do not puncture or cut the chest tube. The change in air pressure could cause the lungs to collapse.

Warning: Make sure to hold the chest tube in place after the anchor suture has been cut, as there is nothing left holding the tube in place.

Warning: If present, do not cut the purse-string suture. Some doctors prefer to include a purse-string suture when inserting the chest tube, for the purpose of closing the site once the tube has been removed.

, To perform the maneuver, have the patient take a deep breath. Then the patient should close the back of the throat (the glottis or windpipe) and attempt to force air through it. The maneuver decreases the chance of the lungs collapsing as the chest tube is removed. The patent can alternately, instead of closing the back of the throat, hold the nose and mouth closed.

, Place one hand gently around the site and use the other to carefully remove the tube. Some fluid leakage and spray is normal. Be prepared for the following steps, as the site must be sealed as soon as possible.

, It may be necessary to have a second pair of hands to close the suture quickly. As the suture is tightened, the hole closes and prevents air from entering. The site should be examined for bubbling, which indicates airflow.

, Several different kinds of dressing can be used (such as an occlusive dressing). The dressing used often depends on the facility performing the procedure. In all cases, the dressing should seal off the site to prevent the entry of any air.

, Double bag the chest tube, disposable pad, and any other supplies that were contaminated during the procedure.



Warning: Avoid contact with medical waste. Blood and other bodily fluids can transmit diseases.

, Look for:


Low blood oxygen saturation (measured using a pulse oximeter).
Persistent bleeding.
Chest discomfort.
Shortness of breath.
Signs of infection.

, An x-ray can indicate if fluid has again built up in the pleural space. It may be necessary to perform another x-ray at a later date.

If you have diabetes, ask if you can take insulin or oral blood sugar medications before the test.Tell your doctor if you have a history of asthma, kidney or bleeding problems. Special precautions may be needed if you have one of these conditions.
You may be asked not to take aspirin (including other products that contain aspirin) or prescription blood thinners for several days before the test. Discuss with your doctor when you can resume these medications.;
, Pregnant women need to be cautious about doing certain things to avoid harming the fetus. If you are or might be pregnant, or if you just had a baby, discuss these details with your doctor so that you can decide on the best course of action.It is extremely important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant because an angiogram is needed to detect a potential coronary artery blockage. This may result in the need for reperfusion stenting to restore blood flow to the heart.
Use formula for one to two days after your angiogram if you are breast-feeding until the dye has passed through your body.

, Your doctor will determine what testing you need to undergo before your angiogram. Make sure you follow your doctor’s directions and complete any recommended testing.You may need to have blood taken or an electrocardiogram done before the angiogram.

, Iodine dye is usually used in the cardiac catheterization test. Your doctor will need to know if you possess such an allergy so you can explore other treatment options.Other possible dyes can cause a reaction in those allergic to shellfish.

, Most angiograms are planned for the morning hours, so this shouldn’t be a huge inconvenience. But it is an important part of preparing for your angiogram.If your test is scheduled for later in the day, do not consume any food or drink for 4-8 hours before the test.

, In the hours preceding your procedure, especially the 24 hours ahead of time, you should avoid alcohol and tobacco products. These can inhibit your behavior, alter test results, and cause other complications during the procedure.If you are given a sedative during the procedure, this could intensify the effects of any alcohol in your system.

, It is important to tell your doctor about any medications you are taking, including prescription, over-the-counter, herbs, and supplements. Bring them in their original bottles. This will help you remember to tell the doctor about the medications you are on.Remember to also notify the doctor about any medications you might be allergic to.

, Even though the angiogram is a simple procedure, you will need to come to the hospital ready for a surgery. Some ways to prepare yourself include:Following your doctor’s instructions on what to eat/drink in the 24 hours leading up to your procedure, which may include not eating or drinking anything in the six to eight hours leading up to your procedure.
Removing your contact lenses, eyeglasses, hair clips, nail polish, and jewelry before the test (leave your jewelry at home, if possible).
Emptying your bladder before the test because it can take several hours.

, At the hospital you’ll need to check in and meet with your medical team to discuss exactly what will happen during the procedure so that you feel prepared. They will let you know about any possible complications or risks.


You’ll be taken to a room where you can change into a hospital gown before the procedure begins.

, After most angiograms, patients stay at the facility for 4-6 hours after the procedure. This is so that the staff can observe you and make sure there are no postoperative complications.During this time, try to relax. Don’t let yourself stress about the results. Just enjoy taking a break while the doctors are there to watch you.

, You may be given a sedative during the angiogram procedure or immediately before it. This sedative will impair your ability to function and to operate a motor vehicle.


You’ll need someone to give you a ride home and help you get settled in after your procedure. Try to find someone you trust who can stay with you for a couple hours (preferably overnight) after you get home in case you need help with anything.
Most medical facilities will refuse to perform an angiogram on you if you do not have a responsible adult with you who has agreed to take you home.

, One of the best ways to help your body recover from any kind of procedure is to get as much rest as possible. This will help your body heal and avoid any potential complications. After the procedure, you’ll probably feel a little discomfort in your groin area. Bed rest will help you avoid moving that area so it can heal properly.


You should probably plan on staying home for a few days after the procedure to help you take it easy.

, Talk to your doctor about any questions or other concerns about the procedure. Tell them how you’re feeling and about any problems you may have encountered.


Ask your doctor about the outcome of the test and what the results mean for you moving forward. Are more tests required? Do you need an operation? Should you change some aspect of your lifestyle?

Clean your hands.,
Remove the mask carefully.,
Dispose of your mask safely.,
Wash your hands again.",How to Put on a Medical Mask2," Depending on what you were doing with your hands before you remove your mask, you may need to wash your hands. Or you may need to remove medical gloves, wash your hands, then remove the mask., In general, remove the mask by only touching the edges, straps, loops, ties or bands. Do not touch the front portion of the mask which may be contaminated.Ear Loops — Use your hands to hold the ear loops and remove them from around each ear.

Ties/Straps — Use your hands to untie the bottom straps first, then untie the top straps. Remove the mask while holding onto the top ties.

Bands — Use your hands to bring the bottom elastic band up and over your head, then use your hands to do the same with the top elastic band. Remove the mask from your face while holding the top elastic band.

, Medical masks are designed to only be used once. Therefore when you take the mask off, place it in the trash immediately.In medical settings there is most likely a garbage bin specifically for biohazardous items like used masks and gloves.
In a non-medical setting where the mask could be contaminated, place the mask by itself inside a plastic bag. Tie the plastic bag closed and then throw the plastic bag in the garbage bin.

, Once you’ve disposed of the mask safely, wash your hands once more to ensure they’re clean and didn’t get contaminated by touching the dirty mask."

Understand what a medical mask protects you from.,
Know the difference between a medical mask and an N95 respirator.",How to Put on a Medical Mask3," Medical or surgical masks are intended to cover both your mouth and nose. They are designed with material that can block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays and splatter — all of which may contain viruses or bacteria that may be harmful to you.Small-sized particles, however, may still be able to penetrate a medical mask. And, because the medical mask isn’t sealed against your skin, particles are also able to penetrate those openings.

, An N95 respirator is a device used by health practitioners to block 95% of very small particles. Unlike medical masks, N95 respirators fit more securely on your face and against your skin, and are able to filter airborne particles.While an N95 respirator can block 95% of very small particles — very small being considered 0.3 microns — there is still a 5% chance harmful particles can penetrate the respirator.
N95 respirators are not designed for use by children or by people who have facial hair.
Some N95 masks come with an exhalation valve that is designed to reduce condensation build-up inside the mask and allow the wearer to breathe easier. These masks, however, should not be used in a situation where a sterile field is required as the exhalation valve allows unfiltered (and possibly contaminated) air to leave the mask.In general, each type of N95 mask should come with detailed instructions from the manufacturer explaining how to put on and take off the mask. In order to ensure proper protection for both you and your patients, these instructions — above all others — must be followed. The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) also requires that users are trained how to fit and use N95 respirators."

Be aware that the swelling will only generally be in one leg, though it can also be in an arm.
Feel your leg with your hand gently and compare it to the other unaffected leg. The swelling may only be slight and not palpable by touch, but you may notice it when putting on articles of clothing such as pants, workout gear, or high boots.
Make sure to look and feel along the veins of your leg for swelling as well.;
, Many people with DVT also experience leg pain and tenderness. In many cases, they describe this as a feeling like a cramp or Charley horse in your leg.Keep a log of when you notice leg pain or tenderness to rule out things like injury. Write down if the cramping or Charley horse comes on during or after exercise or if it happens when you’re just easily walking or sitting down. You may only feel the tenderness when you are standing or walking.In many cases, pain will start in your calf and may radiate from there., In some cases, your leg or arm may feel warm to the touch. When checking for other symptoms, may sure to lay your hands on each part of your leg to see if one section feels warmer than the others.Be aware that the increased warmth may only be in the area that is swollen or causes pain; however, it’s a good idea to feel your entire leg so that you can more easily detect a section that is warm versus one without a temperature difference., The skin on a leg suffering from DVT may also exhibit discoloration. Looking for skin patches that are reddish or bluish in color may indicate that you have a blood clot in your leg.Be aware that discoloration may look like bruising that doesn’t go away. Make sure to watch any discolored spots on your leg to see if they change colors or stay reddish or bluish. If they don’t change, it could signal a clot.

, A blood clot in your leg may not have any visible or palpable signs;however, if a whole or partial clot breaks off and enters your lung, you may have symptoms related to your breathing. If you have any of the following symptoms, seek immediate medical attention:Sudden shortness of breath
Sharp or stabbing pain when breathing that worsens with deep breaths
Rapid heart rate
Sudden bouts of coughing, which may have some blood or mucus
Feeling lightheaded or dizzyFainting
Feelings of dizziness or fainting

, Almost any person can develop a blood clot in his or her leg. There is a wide range of risk factors that may contribute to having DVT. You may be at higher risk for developing a blood clot in your leg if you have one or more of any of the following risk factors:Having surgery of any kind, but especially on the pelvis, abdomen, hip or knee
Smoking
Taking birth control pills
A femoral (thigh) fracture
Undergoing hormone replacement therapy
Being on prolonged bed rest
Being injured
Being overweight or obese
Being pregnant or giving birth
Having cancer
Suffering from inflammatory bowel disease
Having heart failure or a heart attack
Having a personal or family history
You have had a stroke in the past
Being over the age of 60
Sitting for long periods of time, especially driving or flying

, The only definitive way to know if you have a blood clot in your leg is to get a medical diagnosis. If you have any symptoms of a blood clot in your leg without the signs of PE, schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. Make sure to let the office know why you’re calling so that they can schedule you without delay. Your health care provider will perform a full examination, run diagnostic tests, and prescribe or recommend the proper course of treatment based on your condition.Answer any questions your doctor may have about your symptoms and when they started as well as what makes them better or worse. Make sure to let your doctor know about any medication you’re taking, if you’ve ever been treated for cancer, or if you’ve had any recent surgeries or injuries., Before your doctor orders more involved tests, they will perform a physical exam to check for signs of DVT you may have overlooked. Your doctor will check your legs for the signs of DVT. In addition, your healthcare provider will measure your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.Let your doctor know if there is any part of the exam that causes you pain, such as if you experience pain when taking a deep breath while the doctor listens to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope.

, Your doctor may order additional tests to determine whether or not you have DVT or how serious your condition is. The most common diagnostic tests for DVT are:Ultrasound, which is the most common test for DVT. It makes a picture of the veins and arteries in your leg so your doctor can better assess any clot.
D-dimer test, which measures a substance in your blood that is released when a clot breaks up. High levels can indicate a deep vein blood clot.
Spiral CT of chest or ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan to rule out pulmonary embolism.
Venography, which is done when an ultrasound doesn’t give your doctor a clear diagnosis. This procedure requires injecting a dye and then getting an x-ray that illuminates the vein. The x-ray can indicate if blood flow is slow, which may mean you have a deep vein clot.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer tomography (CT) scans, which make pictures of the organs. These tests are not common for DVT, but more generally used for diagnosing PE.

, If your doctor diagnoses you with DVT, they will aim to stop your blood clot from getting bigger, prevent it from breaking off and moving to the lungs, and reduce your chances of another clot. The most common way your doctor will do this is by prescribing anticoagulants, or blood thinners. These medications can be taken either as a pill, injection under the skin, or intravenously.Patients with acute DVT require hospitalization for anticoagulation therapy.


Make sure to ask any questions about the blood thinners you are taking. The two most common are warfarin and heparin. Initially you may be started with heparin then transition to warfarin. Warfarin is given in pill form and may have side effects such as headache, rash, and hair loss. Heparin comes in different forms — your doctor will discuss the best option for you. Heparin can also come with side effects such as bleeding, skin rash, headache, and upset stomach.Be aware that your doctor may prescribe you Heparin and warfarin at the same time. They may also prescribe other injectable blood thinners such as enoxaparin (Lovenox), dalteparin (Fragmin) or fondaparinux (Arixtra).Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking the medication exactly. Taking too much or too little of your medicine can have serious side effects. Follow up weekly for blood work or as recommended by your doctor.

, Some people may not be able to take blood thinners or anticoagulants may not be effective at treating the clot. In these cases, your doctor may suggest inserting a filter into the vena cava, which is a large vein in your abdomen. The filter can prevent clots that have broken loose in your leg from lodging in your lungs., Severe cases of DVT may require medication called thrombolytics, which are also called clot busters. These medications dissolve the clot, which your body would otherwise do naturally in conjunction with other medications.Recognize that thrombolytics run a high risk of causing bleeding, which is why they are reserved for severe or life-threatening cases.Be aware that because of the severity, thrombolytics are only given in an intensive care unit of a hospital. A doctor will administer the drugs through an IV line or through a catheter that has been placed directly into the clot.

, As a complement to any treatment for DVT, your doctor may prescribe wearing compression stockings. These can prevent swelling as well as blood from pooling and clotting in your legs.Have your compression stocking fitted by your doctor or medical supply professional. Doing this can help ensure you get enough compression to be effective against clots. Buying a generic pair fitted for different body types may not be as effective as a pair specifically made for you.
Wear your stockings for two to three years if possible.

, Thrombectomy is a type of surgery used to remove the clot from your leg. This procedure is used in rare cases, such as if your clot is especially severe, getting worse, or not responding to medication."

Check for signs of shock, which include clammy skin (sweaty but cold), paleness, restlessness, nervousness, thirst, severe bleeding, confusion, rapid breath, blotchy or bluish skin, nausea, and vomiting.


If the injured person is having difficulty breathing or bleeding severely, attend to those problems first, even if is necessary to move the injured person to do so. Life threatening trauma must be addressed as quickly as possible. Treatment of fractures can usually wait until after life-threatening conditions are addressed.







, Wrap the ice in some sort of fabric, such as a towel, or use water mixed with ice in a bag.

,, Do not let the person move, as this may increase damage and worsen an injury. If there was a fall, there may also be other undetected injuries that could be disturbed by movement.

The energy spent on doing such activities for thirty minutes five to seven times a week equates to six hundred to twelve hundred calories spent per week.


Exercises need not be always boring. There are a wide range of activities which are entertaining as well as assist in taking care of the clots. These include walking, jogging, swimming, aerobics, playing a sport, or even cycling. As per the American Heart Association, engaging in these activities for about thirty minutes on most days, preferably on all days a week will give optimum results.;
, Specific exercises to prevent clots in veins during long travel or after a major surgery are a great idea to keep blood flowing.


Start with ankle rotations, in clockwise and anti clockwise directions followed by flexion and extension at the ankle joint. Then you can do flexion and extension at the knee joints followed by doing flexion and extension at the hip joints.Wearing compression stockings too facilitates venous circulation.

, The yogic poses which stretch the calves, hip and hamstrings assist in healthy circulation of blood from the lower extremities to the heart. These poses can be done anywhere, anytime. A few minutes of healthy indulgence in these practices can avoid fatal medical emergencies coming your way.""Uttanasana"" or ""standing forward fold"" involves bending forward from the hips and not the waist, with the head touching your knees and the front of your torso stretching. This gives a very good stretch to your hip, hamstring and calf muscles. However, if you have recently suffered from a back injury, this stretch should be avoided.
Another pose which is of immense benefit, especially for clots in deep vein thrombosis, is ""Sarvangasana"" or the ""shoulder stand."" Over here you need to support your shoulders on a stack of one foot blankets or towels with your head on the floor. Then push your feet towards the floor; as you exhale, extend your legs towards the ceiling such that your knees are facing towards your face. This is an excellent exercise for venous circulation which indirectly helps clear blood clots.

, People who do not get enough dietary intake of Omega-3-fatty acids should consider taking a supplement. They are available in form of fish oils, flaxseed oils and primrose oils. Taking about 500 mg of any of these per day is sufficient.


However if you have already suffered from an event due to blood clot (like heart attack), taking a double dose (i.e. 500 mg twice a day) will be more beneficial.

, Another cause which is a potential risk factor for formation of clots is a high homocysteine level. Homocysteine is an amino acid in blood. A high level can make a person prone towards endothelial injury which facilitates clot formation. Deficiency of vitamins like Vitamin B6, B12 and Folic acid can lead to a hyperhomocysteinemia. Hence, taking a combination of this vitamin can help to keep the levels of homocysteine in check.


A combination of 400mcg of folic acid, 1.3mg of vitamin B6 and 2.4 mcg of vitamin B12 is adequate to prevent blocks.
Ginkgo Bilbao is a Chinese herb which has an aspirin-like effect. Taking a dose of 40mg per day helps to keep the blood thin and prevents clots. However, it might interfere if you are on other blood thinning medicines and you must inform your doctor if you are taking this supplement.

, It always helps to take in lots of fluids. A dehydrated body is like an unlubricated  body where the blood cells will be forced to stick to each other to form clots. The fluids in the body create a smooth flow of blood by washing away any clots or plaques which get in the way.


If you're on blood thinners, know that alcohol too can interfere and hence, one must avoid binge drinking at all costs. The best idea would be to limit the drink to one serving of red wine daily.

, Foods which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids have blood thinning properties as well as help in reducing the risk of forming blood clots. Having any one rich source of Omega 3 fatty acids per day is optimum to prevent blood clots.The foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids include fish like mackerel, salmon, lake trout and herring whereas plant sources like flaxseeds, soybean oils, canola oils and walnuts are the richest in these acids.
This could be achieved by eating a serving of fatty fish like salmon, having a handful of walnuts or flaxseed mixed to your favourite morning cereal or tossing your salads in a spoonful of canola or soybean oil.

, This news will instantly bring a smile on a chocoholic’s face. Researchers at the John Hopkins institute have found that having about two tablespoons of dark chocolate helps in preventing clots.


Dark chocolate contain a metabolite called flavonoids. Flavonoids help to keep the blood thin, working in a manner similar to aspirin. They are natural phytochemicals found in plants. However, a word of caution here is to consume these dark chocolates keeping its accompanying ingredients like butter and sugar to a minimum quantity.
Vitamin E also has plenty of flavonoids. Avocados, spinach, almonds, peanuts are good sources of vitamin E.

, These spices is endowed with anti-inflammation properties by nature. Turmeric contains curcumin which has the potency to lower the inflammation and also keep it under control. Inflammation is one of the major causes of arteriosclerosis or hardening of the arteries.


Curcumin is a blessing to the heart as it can reduce the fat deposits in the arteries by about 26%.
Regular eating of garlic helps clean out the arteries. It keeps blood pressure under control and prevents the formation of blood clots.

, Pomegranates contain phytochemicals that play the role of antioxidants in shielding the arteries from getting damaged. This antioxidant rich fruit stimulates the body to produce nitric oxide in abundance which in turn enables the uninterrupted flow of blood and keeping the arteries unclogged.


Grapefruit contains pectin which is a soluble fiber. This fiber cuts down the cholesterol. This also minimizes the chances of atherosclerosis.

, Here's why:


Eating potassium rich cranberries can lower the LDL and increase HDL. The overall risk of heart related diseases comes down by almost 40%.
Red grapes are excellent source of lutein. Lutein is a carotenoid that reduces the chances of arteriosclerosis. This also prevents/reduces the chances of thickening of the carotid artery in the neck region.
Cherries have 17 elements that can clear up the plaque clogging the arteries. They also have fiber that is beneficial in lowering cholesterol.

, Having a large portion of Vitamin K-rich food one day and not having any Vitamin K enriched food the other can cause a large variation in the blood prothrombin time.Prothrombin time is an indicator of the time that the blood will take to clot. The test to monitor this time is called PT INR. For patients on Warfarin therapy the target is to keep this level in a range of 2-3 units.
Foods rich in Vitamin K include green leafy vegetables like kale, spinach, mustard greens, collard greens, turnip greens, broccoli, romaine lettuce, brussel sprouts and canola and soybean oils. (Avoid these leafy greens if you are Factor 5 Leiden!)

, These provide thorough protection in the form of antioxidants present in both in abundance. Polyphenols (flavonoids in green tea) are very potent antioxidants that contain the right tool to prevent formation of blood clots in the arteries in the form of procyanidins. Hawthorn tea also can reduce blood pressure and assist in the restoration and retention of the blood vessel elasticity.


These procyanidins also contribute to the development of healthy heart and blood vessels protecting tissues called endothelium.

, Both of these have exceptionally high levels of carotenoid lycopene, an antioxidant that is equipped to cut the risk of atherosclerosis by almost 50%. This prevents the formation of artery clogging plaque.


As for sweet potatoes, they are great at maintaining blood pressure at the optimal levels. They are exceptionally high in cholesterol lowering components such as fiber, beta carotene, folate, vitamin C and potassium.

, Apples contains the soluble fiber pectin which assists in the process of keeping the arteries unclogged. They are an excellent source of potassium and magnesium that are capable of preventing and even reversing the hardening of the arteries.


Watermelon is a very heart-friendly food. Consumption of watermelon produces nitric oxide which can unclog as well as improve the functioning of the blood vessels. It is also successful in lowering blood pressure levels.

, Garbanzo beans contain both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. They are effective in removing cholesterol containing bile from the body and also in averting heart related diseases.


Natto is one of the traditional foods of the Japanese. It is prepared with soybeans that have been fermented using the benign bacteria ‘Bacillus subtilis’. It is enriched with nattokinase, an enzyme that works amazingly on blood clots. It not only dissolves them but also inhibits the formation of new ones., Present in pineapples is an enzyme called ‘bromelain’ that is a clot-buster and also possesses the properties to dissolve/disintegrate the fibrin that is responsible for the aggregation of platelets. Bromelain dissolves the fibrin in blood clots by stimulating the production of plasmin. It assists in keeping away the platelets from sticking to the endothelium (blood vessels wall).Kiwis possess the properties to reduce blood clotting, too. They are enriched with nutrients and minerals such as vitamin C, potassium, copper, magnesium and fiber. They can also can unclog the arteries by breaking down the fat build-up in the blood. And they have anti-inflammation properties too!, Salicylates are compounds that inhibit the formation of blood clots. They are found in abundance in many herbs and spices such as thyme, turmeric, ginger, paprika, cinnamon and cayenne.


They are also found in fruits such as cranberries, strawberries, blueberries, oranges, prunes, raisins and grapes.
In addition, they are found in beverages such as green tea, wine, honey, vinegar and pineapple juice.

Seek a support group.",How to Deal with a Concussion," Some symptoms of a concussion can occur immediately after your injury, such as losing consciousness (“blacking out”), nausea, headache or a feeling of pressure in the head, dizziness, confusion, and ringing in the ears.However, sometimes you feel fine immediately after an injury, and symptoms do not begin until hours or even days later. If you hit your head, fall, or jar your head or neck like with whiplash, immediately stop what you’re doing and do not return to activity that day.


Do not try to walk or stand immediately after your injury, unless you are in immediate physical danger. Rest seated or lying down until you know you can move without feeling ill.
Athletes, usually hockey and football players, must be medically evaluated before returning to play.;
, If you feel weak on one side of your body, are vomiting continuously, are confused or anxious, have neck pain, or are very drowsy, call for immediate medical care. Severe symptoms like these may indicate a more severe brain injury.


Someone may have to call for help for you if you are unable.
If you have neck or head pain, do NOT move until help arrives. Injuries that cause concussions can also result in spinal injuries, which can cause permanent damage.

, Even if you had minimal discomfort immediately after your injury, you should get medical help right away if your symptoms worsen in the next few hours or days. You may have a headache that gets worse and worse, begin to feel clumsy or start to stumble, get progressively dizzier, or feel confused or have problems with speech., Unless you had epilepsy before your injury and have frequent seizures, having a seizure after getting a concussion may indicate a serious problem. Don’t wait to get medical attention.Post-traumatic seizures are those that occur one week after the brain injury. Post-traumatic seizures are common in those who suffer from a severe traumatic brain injury, especially those that have an intracranial hemorrhage.

, In general, your pupils (the black centers of your eyes) should be the same size. If one pupil becomes larger than the other, it may indicate a neurological condition. Go to your doctor right away., Even if you did not lose consciousness or experience immediate symptoms, see your doctor after any head injury. They will be able to evaluate you for other injuries that may have occurred, assess the severity of your symptoms, and give you further treatment advice. They may refer you for a CT scan or an MRI so they can rule out other brain injuries.Bring a friend or loved one with you to the appointment to take notes and help you later. You might have trouble concentrating and need reminders.Sometimes your doctor may refer you to other specialists, like a neurologist if you’re having severe symptoms or problems with your nerves, or a chiropractor or physical therapist to help with pain from your car accident, for instance.

, Young children can get concussions, too, but are often unable to tell you how they feel. If a child receives any injury that could cause damage to their head, watch for behavior changes and problems with balance and coordination. Children with a concussion may:Seem dazed, overly tired, or listless.
Be irritable, cranky, or very tearful.
Lose interest in toys and normal activities.
Appear off-balance or unsteady when walking or standing.
Experience changes in sleep and eating habits.

, Before returning to play, recovered child athletes should complete a full-course of non-contact exercise, this should include challenges of gradually increasing intensity., For the first 24 hours after your injury it’s important to have someone stay with you to make sure your symptoms are not getting worse.Your caregiver should be someone who knew you before the injury so that they are familiar with your baseline personality and thinking patterns. If your symptoms worsen at all, your caregiver should take you to the hospital or call for emergency medical assistance.


While you sleep during those first 24 hours, your caregiver should wake you up every 1-2 hours to check on your symptoms. You should be able to wake up normally. They can ask you what your name is, what state you live in, or what day of the week it is to ensure you aren’t getting confused. Neurological checks every 2 hours is important in the course of treatment and care.

, Despite popular belief, it’s okay to sleep when you have a concussion. You will likely require more sleep than usual as your brain recovers. Sleep is a great way to rest your brain right after your injury as well as throughout the next several weeks, so continue to nap throughout the day if you need to., If possible, take time off of work or school or find childcare so that you can rest for up to two weeks. Rest truly is the only medicine for a concussion, and the more you can rest after your injury the more quickly you will recover. Enlist family, friends or hired help to ease your burden for several weeks.

, You may be very sensitive to sounds and light after a concussion, and will likely be more comfortable keeping still than moving around. Your brain needs rest in order to heal, and this includes rest from stimulus. Lie in a quiet room with closed blinds or a towel over your eyes as much as you can.


Do not try to read, text, or watch TV to pass the time. This stimulates your brain. True brain rest requires calm, quiet, stillness, and minimal brain activation.
Avoid activities that raise your heart rate, like fast walking or lifting weights., No matter what you do, you may have post-concussion symptoms beginning a few days after your injury and lasting up to 2-3 weeks. Some people experience post-concussion symptoms for months. Symptoms may include dizziness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating.Some people also develop emotional symptoms like depression, which can last for several weeks to months.


Once a concussion has been sustained, you cannot prevent further symptoms. Rest as much as you can. Be patient and know that this is a normal part of the process.
Headaches may not develop until weeks or months after a head injury.

, This can be an uncomfortable and challenging time. In order to focus on your recovery, try to keep your stress to a minimum. Meditate daily and try mindfulness exercises. Do deep breathing techniques. Give yourself a hand massage. Do whatever calming, non-strenuous activities you enjoy.

, If you have a headache, it’s okay to take products like Tylenol that use the ingredient acetaminophen. This may alleviate some discomfort. However, do not take Advil, Motrin, or anything containing ibuprofen or aspirin – this could increase the risk of bleeding in your brain., If you have any remaining symptoms of concussion whatsoever, do not do anything that may cause further brain injury. Avoid riding a bike, playing sports, going on roller coasters – anything that may injure or jostle your brain. Second impact syndrome is caused when you get another concussion before the first heals, and it can cause fast and potentially fatal swelling of your brain.The term” second impact syndrome” is used when there is diffuse brain swelling after a second impact to the head.

, Your response time and ability to focus may be impaired after a concussion, which can make driving dangerous.Avoid driving until your symptoms improve. Speak with your doctor about your symptoms and whether it’s safe for you to drive, ride a bike, or use heavy equipment.

, After your initial time of complete rest, return to work, school, and other mental activities slowly. Start with half days, and speak with employers or teachers about having a lighter workload for several weeks as you ease back in to mental work.


Your doctor will likely be willing to write a note for you requesting this if they think you need it.

, Do not restart any physical activities or even anything that raises your heart rate until you are free of concussion symptoms and have been checked by your doctor. Then return to playing your sport, riding your bike, or exercising slowly and gradually.It is not uncommon to feel symptoms return when you start to be physical. Let your body be your guide as you increase your activity level. If you start to feel sick, stop your activity for the day and rest. You will gradually build your stamina back up.
Many sports teams have a post-concussion return-to-play protocol to ease you back in to your sport safely. If not, do not let anyone convince you to play before you’re well. Ask your doctor or a sports therapist for guidelines, and take responsibility for your health.
According to the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine and the American Academy of Neurology, the concern for recurrent concussions has lead to serious consequences such as second impact syndrome and dementia, which has lead to the development of a series of guidelines that address concussion severity and return to play for athletes., It can be frustrating trying to return to your daily life while you are having difficulty concentrating, remembering and thinking. These problems will improve, but in the mean time help yourself by making lists of things you have to remember or writing notes as ideas occur to you. Focus on one task at a time.Consult with loved ones you trust before making any important decisions while your brain is recovering.

, Drinking alcohol or using any drugs that aren’t prescribed to you can delay your recovery. Do not drink alcohol until your doctor tells you that it is safe to do so., Having had a previous concussion is a risk-factor for getting another concussion, and unfortunately the effects of concussions are cumulative over your lifetime. This means that each subsequent concussion is easier to get, and has more severe symptoms than the last. Suffering from multiple concussions can even cause permanent problems after many years. If you’ve had a concussion, consider what activities are safe for you to do.You may need to refrain from contact sports like football, rugby, hockey, and roller derby, in which concussions are common.
Some people find they can no longer go on roller coasters or handle the loud noise of concerts without feeling unwell.

, Always wear a helmet and protective gear when playing sports or riding a bicycle or motorcycle. Fasten your seatbelt any time you are in a vehicle. Check your home to ensure there is nothing you may trip over, like a loose rug., Some people experience symptoms of a concussion for much longer than others, even months or years. If you have to give up activities that you love, refrain from exercising like you once did, or struggle to be as mentally active as before your injury, you may feel discouraged, isolated or depressed. Find a local support group or join an online community to build solidarity with others who are experiencing similar struggles.


If you feel deeply depressed, anxious, or have thoughts of self-harm, seek professional care.

Assess how bad the cut is.,
Wash your hands.,
Apply pressure to stop the bleeding.,
Clean the cut.,
Put on antibiotic ointment.,
Cover the wound.",How to Cover Up Cuts1," Inspect your cut to see if it is deep enough to require stitches, or if you can treat it at home. If the wound is gaping, jagged, or exposing muscle or fat, see a doctor as soon as possible. The cut should be stitched within a few hours to reduce the risk of infection or scarring., It is important to remember to wash your hands before touching your cut or scrape to avoid infection. Wet and lather your hands with an antibacterial soap, then scrub for twenty seconds and rinse. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer., Shallow cuts and scrapes will usually stop bleeding on their own. If bleeding persists, apply pressure to the wound with a clean cloth. If possible, elevate the wound to help stop the bleeding., Rinse the wound gently with clean, drinking-quality tap water. Wash the surrounding area with a gentle soap and water, avoiding the actual open wound, and pat it dry with a clean cloth or piece of gauze. Sterilize a pair of tweezers by cleaning them with alcohol, then use them to remove any dirt or debris that might be stuck to your cut.If dirt or debris remain in the cut, contact your doctor as soon as possible.
Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or iodine to clean the wound, as they can further damage the tissue around your wound and make it harder to heal.

, Shallow cuts or scrapes can heal on their own, but adding an antibiotic ointment can speed up the process. Purchase an ointment (such as Bacitracin ) at your local pharmacy. Apply a thin layer to your cut after cleaning and drying it thoroughly., Once the wound is dry, cover it with a bandage. Alternatively, cover the area with a small piece of gauze and attach the gauze to your skin with medical tape. The bandage should be changed whenever it gets wet or dirty, or if blood soaks through.The dressing can be removed after a few days, once the cut has closed itself."

Check your ABC's.,
Finish taking care of the victim's airway, breathing and circulation.,
Check the neck.,
Inspect the head and neck while you are feeling the cervical vertebra.,
Continue feeling down the spine through the thoracic vertebra (T1 - T12).,
Finish your palpitations through the lumbar vertebra (L1-L5), feeling for pain, tenderness or swelling in this area.,
Communicate with the victim throughout the entire process.,
Gather 4 other rescuers and have one of them position himself at the victim's head, and facing his toes.,
Log roll the victim onto her side and visually inspect her backside quickly.","How to Conduct a Secondary Survey of the Neck, Spine and Back During First Aid","


Airway. The victim must have a patent airway. There can be no obstruction and air should freely move in and out. Without a patent airway, nothing else matters. If the patient cannot get oxygen, the patient will not have a heartbeat much longer.
Breathing. After you have ensured a patent airway, check the victim to see if she is breathing on her own. If she is not, you will have to breathe for her. If you do not have a bag-valve-mask, start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Circulation. When you are checking for breathing, you will also need to check for a pulse or a heartbeat. If one is not detected, you will need to start CPR immediately.;
, Once these are stabilized, you will need to make sure that there is no major bleeding that needs to be controlled.

, Feel the C1 through C4 vertebra. These start from the base of the skull to the shoulders. You are looking for swelling, tenderness or crepitus. Be gentle.

, Look for bruising or clear fluid leaking from the ears.

, Again, you are feeling for pain, tenderness or swelling.

, Trauma in this area would have been significantly severe if these strong bones were damaged.

, The victim will have major anxiety and not knowing what you are doing only adds to this. Speak to the victim in a calm, reassuring voice, explaining what you are doing while you are doing it. This goes a long way in keeping the victim calm and relaxed.

, Hold the victim's head and keep it perfectly still. The neck should stay in line with the axis of the spine. 3 other rescuers should take their positions alongside the victim's body. The 4th should stand by waiting to move the backboard into place.

, Log roll her back onto the backboard and secure her head, shoulders, abdomen and legs. Once the victim is completely immobilized to the board, move her onto a cot and transport her to the nearest hospital.

Use concealer and an eyeliner brush.,
Wear camouflaging clothing.,
Apply a temporary tattoo.,
Wear decorative bandages.",How to Cover Up Cuts2," To hide cuts, scrapes, or scratches, purchase concealer makeup and an angled eyeliner brush (available at pharmacies or beauty supply stores). Apply the concealer with the brush just along the cut, making the line as fine as possible.Apply a light dusting of translucent powder over the area to set the makeup and prevent it from rubbing off.Always use a clean brush and only apply makeup to a closed wound.

, Clothing is one of the simplest and most effective ways to cover up cuts on your body. Long sleeves and pants (or long skirts) will hide cuts or scrapes while they heal. In warm weather, balance your outfit by wearing less-covering items of clothing on areas of your body that do not have blemishes.For instance, if you wear longs sleeves to hide cuts or scrapes on your arms, wear shorts to balance out your look.
Be sure that your clothing is loose enough to give your cuts space to heal.

, Temporary tattoos can be a fun way to cover your cuts once they have closed over. Purchase temporary tattoos at a beauty supply store or make your own temporary tattoos using eyeliner. After a few days, be sure to remove temporary tattoos as gently as possible with a gentle soap and water., To hide your cuts in plain sight, make your own colorful bandages with decorative tape (available at craft stores or online). Attach a strip of colorful tape to the non-adhesive side of the bandage and trim away the excess tape around the edges. Apply it to your cut as you would a regular band-aid."

Seek help to deal with your self-harming issue.,
Use camouflage makeup.,
Get a tattoo.",How to Cover Up Cuts3," Even if your period of self-harming is behind you, seeking help can make the recovery and coping process much easier. Speak to your doctor about your options (which may include counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy), and consider whether there might be contributing factors that caused your self-harming behaviour in the first place, like an eating disorder or sexual abuse. Coming to terms with the behaviour and understanding it may change the way you view your scars, and how you wish to cover them., As part of your recovery process, you may wish to hide your self-harm scars with thick, camouflaging makeup. Choose a green-based concealer, which will cover the red undertones of your scars effectively. Dab the makeup over the scar until you are happy with the coverage, then pat the surface of your skin with a powder foundation.For best results, choose a concealer that closely matches your skin tone and avoid any that have brightening properties, which will draw attention to your scars.

, Book a consultation with a reputable tattoo artist to discuss the possibility of tattooing over a scar (or scars) left behind from your self-harming period. Bring a design to the consultation, or have a clear idea of what you want to have as a tattoo before meeting with them. Be sure that you are ready for the commitment of having a tattoo, taking into consideration how you might feel about it in the future."

First check the airway, breathing and circulation.,
Starting at the head, look and feel for any lumps or bumps, being careful not to move the injured person/ change position of spine.,
Check the eyes for dilation (this may indicate any brain damage incurred).,
Check for their level of consciousness by asking,""are you alright?,
Checking the face: is the colour abnormal?,
Checking the ears: Check for injury and then look inside the ears.,
Checking the mouth: Are the lips blue?,
Checking the neck: Feel for bulging.,
Checking the Ribcage: feel the ribcage firmly, checking for any grinding or disfigurement that could indicate broken bones.

,
Checking the stomach: Again, check for firmness/tenderness and any bulging in four sections of the abdomen.,
Checking the hips: Rock the hips gently from side-to-side and push down to check that they move freely and are not dislocated.

,
If you must examine the genitals, do so quickly and accurately.,
Checking the legs: Gradually move down the legs feeling for any grinding or visible disfigurement.,
Checking the arms: Follow the same steps as checking the legs but also; check for needle marks, check for ID bracelet or medi-tag, press nail beds and check that they turn white and then pink (this is commonly referred to as capillary refill).",How to Complete a Top to Toe Assessment of an Injury," If they are not breathing or have no pulse, begin rescue breathing or CPR.;
, Are they bleeding? Is there any dried blood? At this point, you should also be checking the face for any pain response.

, Are they blood shot?

,"", ""can you hear me?"" Continue by tapping on the shoulder, but be careful not to move the neck if a spinal injury is suspected.

, Is the skin Patchy? does the temperature feel okay? Is the skin moist or clammy? Is there any swelling or disfigurement? Are there any pain responses?

, If there is a sticky straw coloured fluid leaking, this may be a sign of spinal injury; DO NOT touch this fluid and DO NOT stop it from flowing.

, This could be a sign of poor circulation, also called cyanosis. How does the breath smell? Could the casualty have consumed alcohol, or inhaled glue or another gas? If the breath smells of pear drops or acetone this could be a sign that the casualty is diabetic and in some form of shock.

, Are there any cuts or swelling? Check firmness to touch. This could indicate internal bleeding. Check to make sure that the trachea is going down the middle of the neck. A windpipe that is off to the side could indicate air in the chest that is outside of the lung.

,, This could be trapped air, or internal bleeding.

,, Never skip this part when necessary just because of invading patient privacy, but then again respect the patient's privacy as much as possible.

, Is there any swelling? Any cuts or contusions (bruises)? Try to find a pulse in the foot(just around the top where the foot meets the ankle); is there a presence or absence of a pulse?

, If it takes more than two seconds for the nailbeds to return to their original color, this could be a sign of poor circulation. Check for a pulse in the wrist; is there a presence or absence of a pulse?

Apply gentle pressure to the small wound.,
Stop the bleeding.,
Remove any debris from the wound.,
Clean the wound with cool water.,
Deposit a thin layer of antibiotic cream on the wound.",How to Close a Wound During First Aid1," Quickly grab a clean cloth, towel, or piece of gauze, and apply it gently to the wounded region. Hold it there until the bleeding begins to slow, a small scrape or wound takes 25 to 30 seconds to clot, while a larger wound will take longer. During this process, if the towel or gauze becomes soaked with blood, place another absorptive layer on top of it. Do not remove the first layer of saturated gauze, as this will rip off the forming scab and re-open the wound. To remove the first layer of gauze or cloth attached to a wound, pour sterile water on the gauze as it lays on the wound so you will not cause it to start bleeding again.Always wash your hands before providing first aid, especially when dealing with an open wound. If you have nitrile medical gloves available, put these on before beginning the first aid.;
, You’ll need to hold a towel or gauze in place for a few minutes to fully stop the bleeding. In the case of a minor scratch or scrape, bleeding will normally stop not long after the cut is sustained., Once the bleeding has stopped, you will need to clean out any residual dirt or debris from the small wound. Using a pair of tweezers, gently extract any small stones or pieces of soil that may be stuck in the exposed flesh.It’s okay to leave specks of dirt in the wound at this point, as they’ll be rinsed out when you pour water on the wound.

, Now that the wound is free of dirt and debris, your next priority is to clean the wounded area. If you’re near a house or building, you can use the water from a faucet or hose. If not, rinse the wound with clean water from a water bottle. Running water over the area for 5-10 minutes will remove any lingering dirt or bacteria.Never apply any antibiotic until the wound is cleaned out.
If you have them, use soap and water to better clean the wound.

, This cream will kill any bacteria that may have gotten in the wound, and help the wound to scab and heal more quickly. The cream will also seal the wound, making it airtight. Common brands of antibiotic creams include Neosporin, Polysporin, A & D ointment or Bacitracin.Do not put rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide or iodine on an open wound. These antiseptics are very caustic and will burn the wound, causing pain, delaying healing and increasing scarring.

Examine the wound.,
Determine if medical attention is needed.,
Stop the bleeding.,
Remove small foreign objects.,
Irrigate the wound.,
Bandage the wound.,
Reexamine the wound daily.,
Irrigate the wound.,
Apply an antibiotic.,
Bandage the wound.",How to Clean a Wound," The first step in treating any injury is to examine it closely. You'll need to determine the nature and severity of the wound. Take a close look at the injury and pay attention to the following:The amount of blood. How rapidly is the person bleeding? Does the blood come out in a steady flow, or is it pulsing?
Foreign objects in the wound. This might be the cause of the wound itself, like a fishhook, or a piece of glass.
Dirt or debris in or around the wound.
Evidence of a bone fracture, like a protruding bone, swelling over a bone, or inability to move a limb. Look for this especially if the person was injured in a fall.Evidence of internal bleeding, like swelling, large purple areas on the skin, or abdominal pain.In the case of animal attacks, look for signs of bites and multiple injuries. If you live in an area where there are venomous snakes or insects, it may be helpful to know what those injuries look like.;
, You can often treat minor wounds at home. But, in the case of a serious wound, the injured person should see a doctor immediately. Seek medical attention if:


The wound is bleeding a lot, the bleeding is pulsing, and/or it won't stop.
The wound is more than one centimeter deep. This may require stitches.
There is any significant head trauma.There is evidence of a bone fracture or internal bleeding.The wound is dirty and the injured person has not had a recent tetanus vaccination.This is especially important if the wound came from a rusty metal object.
The person is known to be taking blood thinners. This is especially important if the person has suffered head trauma.

, Apply gentle pressure to the wound using a wad of cloth or gauze, with excess fabric wrapped around the wounded area. Elevate the wounded area above the person's heart, if possible.


Elevating the wounded area will decrease blood flow to the wound and decrease bleeding.If bleeding doesn't stop within 10 to 15 minutes, seek immediate medical help., If there are any objects in the wound that you can remove (such as a a small rock, splinter, or fishhook), carefully take them out.


Use sanitized tweezers for small objects, if you have them available.
Do not remove large objects from a wound. You can further open the wound and increase bleeding.If there is a large amount of debris in the wound, especially if the wound is large (e.g. a ""road rash"" injury), seek medical attention. Removing the debris can require painful scrubbing, and a local anesthetic may be a good idea.

, Once the bleeding has stopped, the next step is thoroughly cleanse the area with warm, flowing water. This is arguably the most important step for promoting speedy recovery.There are several good ways to do this:


Use a bulb syringe (available in most drug stores) filled with warm tap water or normal saline (you can use a large bottle of saline solution for contact lenses if you're in a pinch). Squeeze the liquid out onto the wound. Repeat for a volume of approximately two liters. You won't need to irrigate as much on the face or scalp. These areas have many blood vessels and will clean the wound naturally through bleeding.
A 60cc syringe with IV catheter tip provides the best volume and pressure of irrigation. It also provides directed irrigation to get behind skin flaps and other difficult areas. If you go to a doctor for care, this is most likely what he or she will use.
You can also use running warm tap water. Run at least two liters, the size of a large plastic soda bottle, over the wound. Continue until all wound areas are free of debris and all flaps cleaned under.
Wounds from burns should be generously irrigated with cool water to bring down temperature.In the case of chemical burns irrigation dilutes the chemical and reduces tissue damage.

, After cleaning the wound, wrap it in a clean bandage. Bandaging restricts mobility so that wound edges can come together and heal. It also protects from further injury and infection.


Use a bandage that is slightly larger than the wound itself.Any commercially available bandage material will work for most wounds. Gauze is the mainstay, either rolled or in 2x2 or 4x4 options depending on wound size.
Burns, abrasions, or wounds with irregular edges should be covered with a non-stick or Telfa pad, as dried blood and healing skin can stick to gauze.
Iodine impregnated gauze is best for wounds need to stay open, such as abscesses or puncture wounds., After 48 hours, recheck the wound daily.Carefully remove the bandage and look for signs of infection or other complications. Contact a doctor if you see signs of infection.


If the bandage is crusted on to wound and won't come off easily, soak it in warm water.While the wound is exposed, assess for signs of infection. These include redness of the skin around the wound edges or redness progressing up the injured limb. Look for drainage of pus or that is greenish-yellow in color.Feel gently with your fingers for warmth in the area, and increased swelling. These can be warning signs, especially in the presence of redness.
Check the injured person's temperature for fever. Anything of 100.4 or above is cause for alarm, and you must seek immediate medical attention.
If an infection becomes trapped inside the skin, the wound may need to be reopened by a doctor. Some infected wounds require antibiotics or even an operation under general anesthesia. This is especially common in cases where the wound was not irrigated properly.

, If the wound is clean, irrigate again to maintain cleanliness. Just run water over the wound for one minute. Wash any clotted blood off with soap and water.


Use soap and water to clean the surrounding skin and parts of wound that are not wide open. Sing the birthday song twice while sudsing and you will have done a thorough job!

, Once is it cleansed, apply a small coating of neosporin or other topical antibiotic ointment to the wound with a Q-tip. This reduces the chances of infection.This is not a substitute for thorough cleaning and irrigation. Apply sparingly, and if the wound is macerated, let it dry before applying any ointment.

, Place a clean bandage over the wound. Between inspections, keep the bandage clean and dry.


Repeat the inspection process daily until the wound is healed.
Continue to elevate wound as much as possible, for at least the first few days. This will minimize pain and swelling.

Know the steps in the primary survey.,
Start the secondary assessment or survey after the patient has been secured or stabilized.,
Begin at the head and end at the toe.,
Carefully check for fractures of the chest.,
Inspect the abdomen visually for obvious trauma, wounds or injuries such as burns, distension or an avulsion with organs protruding.

,
Feel the abdomen for tenderness where there are not obvious wounds present.",How to Conduct a Secondary Survey of the Chest and Abdomen During First Aid," This is the initial patient assessment that is done right after the scene size-up. This is your initial thoughts and decision making period as you roll up on the scene of the accident or incident. The basic steps are easy to remember if you consider them your basics.


Airway. The first and most vital thing you need to do is make sure that the victim has an open airway. Whether breathing on his own, or with assistance, oxygen is vitally important as without it, nothing else matters. The victim will die without an open airway.
Breathing. After an open airway is secured, make sure the victim is breathing. If not, you will need to start breathing for her.
Circulation. If there is no circulation, you must start CPR.
Disability. Check the patient's alertness. Check the head, neck and spinal areas. Check for distal pulse and the ability for the patient to move his extremities.
Expose. Being ever so mindful of the patient's privacy, remove clothing where injuries are suspected. You cannot assess a patient in places that you cannot actually see.;
, If the patient is conscious and alert, you will need to get his consent before examining him and be sure to communicate exactly what you are doing and why.

, The secondary assessment is just as systematic as the primary assessment. When you get to the chest, you will want to check for bruising or unusual coloration, lumps, puncture wounds or flailing of the chest. Listen for abnormal breathing sounds from front to back and all 4 quadrants. You are also listening for equal breathing from both lungs.

, Warn the patient that this might be extremely painful if fractures are present.

,, If there is pain, the patient will react immediately by trying to cover up the area with his hands or arms.

"
"
Call emergency services for a serious injury.,
Do not remove an impaling object from a puncture wound.,
Press firmly on the wound with a sterile dressing.,
Elevate the injured area above the heart.,
Keep the victim from moving in case of fracture.",How to Close a Wound During First Aid2," In any serious medical situation, always call emergency services after or during the first-aid process. While you don't need to call emergency services for minor scrapes and cuts (including bruises, skin-deep cuts, or mild burns), it's best to be cautious in more serious circumstances. Call emergency services in the case of:Broken bones (especially if visible through the skin).
Bleeding that won't stop.
Vomiting blood, or large amounts of blood coming out of any orifice
Spurting or gushing blood

, Let emergency personnel take care of this, since you have no idea what is going on beneath the skin or what organ the object could be impaled into.Extract the object slowly. If you rip it out suddenly, you may enlarge the puncture wound or cause further tissue damage and blood loss.

If the impaling object is very large, and you’re concerned that the victim may bleed out if you remove the object, leave it in and try to stabilize the impaled object until the emergency crew arrives and takes over. Do not let go of the object until told to do so by the paramedics.

, Depending on the severity of the wound or puncture, you may need to press quite firmly on the bloody area to stop the bleeding. Apply pressure using a clean piece of medical gauze from a first aid kit or a clean cotton cloth.In an emergency, you may need to use a piece of clothing or even your bare hands.

Before interacting with any open gash or puncture wound, make sure to clean your hands with soap. If you have access to nitrile gloves, put those on as well, to prevent bacterial infection. If you do not have access to either of these things you may not be able to wash your hands. In these cases applying pressure to stop the bleeding is the first priority., This will diminish the amount of blood flowing to the wounded area, and make the bleeding stop sooner. If you’re at home, rest the injured area on a chair or sofa cushion. If you’re outdoors, you can rest the elevated limb on a rock or on a balled-up jacket. Keep pressure on the wound or puncture while elevating the limb or body part.If you’re dealing with a small puncture wound, the bleeding may soon stop on its own. However, for a more serious open or puncture wound, stopping the bleeding immediately is of the utmost importance.

, If you can tell that the victim has a broken bone (or if the fracture is clearly visible), tell the victim to remain still. They should not move the limb with broken bones, or the fracture may become worse (or cut into the surrounding flesh).If the bones have broken through the skin, make sure to stop the bleeding before dealing with the fracture. Before medical personnel arrive, cover the open fracture with a clean dry cloth and do not try to put the bone back in place.

"
"
Dress the wound properly with a bandage.,
Change the wound’s dressing often.,
Monitor the wound for infection.,
Stock a first-aid kit wherever possible.,
Assemble your own first-aid kit.",How to Close a Wound During First Aid3," If the wound is more serious than a minor scrape or scratch, you’ll need to apply a bandage as part of the first-aid procedure. Take a piece of sterile gauze from your first-aid kit, and place it over the open wound. Then use medical adhesive tape to secure the gauze to the skin on all four sides.If the wound is smaller, just use a standard Band-Aid to cover the open area.
You can use Steri-strips to pull the sides of the wound together if it is a sliced cut, then put on antibiotic cream or ointment and cover with gauze and tape.

, If the wound continues to bleed in small amounts, or if the blood soaks through the gauze bandage, you’ll need to change the dressing. Keep the wound clean and dry, and plan to change the bandage three times per day as long as needed.As long as the wound continues bleeding, redress it with a brand new bandage, along with some fresh antibiotic cream.

, With any wound more serious than a minor scrape, the wounded individual runs the risk of contracting an infection. Puncture wounds are especially prone to infection, since they can heal quickly and keep bacteria inside. If you suspect that the wound may be getting infected, take the wounded individual to a doctor immediately. Common signs of infection include:Increased swelling
Fever
Increasing pain
Redness or warmth
Draining pus
Red streaks coming from the wound and starting up a vein is especially dangerous and needs immediate medical attention, do not wait!

, You should always have a first-aid kit handy in your home and in your car. Always bring one with you if you're in nature hiking, camping, or cycling. Standard stocked first-aid kits are usually readily available at your local pharmacy at reasonable prices.


If your child plays sports or you go on a family vacation, bringing a first-aid kit is also advisable.

, If you would prefer not to purchase a first-aid kit, or would rather customize your kit, you can purchase the necessary supplies at a grocery store, pharmacy, or medical supply store. Make sure to include various sizes of bandages, Neosporin, gauze, tape, scissors, a pair of tweezers, a small bottle of sterile water, and cotton swabs. Disposable instant ice packs can be useful as well.

Store all of these elements together in an easily-opened zippered pouch or a plastic box, such as a Tupperware container. Clearly mark the container as a first aid kit so it can be easily identified in an emergency.

Wash your hands.Before attempting to clean a cut, either on yourself or on another person, it is key that your own hands be clean.,
Stop the bleeding.Before cleaning the cut, it is also key to stop the bleeding.,
Rinse the wound with clear water.Assuming that you have achieved hemostasis (which is the medical word for stopping the bleeding), you can proceed with steps to clean the cut.,
Remove any foreign material from the cut.Use tweezers if needed to get out any debris from the site of the wound.,
Apply an antibiotic cream or ointment.Once you have cleaned the wound and removed any debris, apply an antibiotic cream or ointment such as Polysporin over the injured area.,
Cover the cut with a bandage.Place a bandage over the cut to first of all hold the cream or ointment in place, and secondly to protect the wound from any further damage.,
Consider the date of your last tetanus immunization.The risk of contracting a tetanus infection is highest with puncture wounds, or with wounds that contain foreign material in them.",How to Clean Cuts1," This way, you will not introduce any germs or foreign substances into the cut that may later cause it to become infected.


If available, put on some single-use gloves after washing your hands for more protection;
, For minor cuts and scratches, this may not be an issue. However, for wounds that are bleeding more heavily try elevating the injured area above the level of the heart (as this decreases blood flow to the area), and apply gentle pressure as needed. You can use a clean cloth to apply the pressure, as this will also soak up any blood as it appears.


If the cut is from a large stabbing object that remains imbedded in the person's body, do not attempt to remove it, as this will cause more bleeding. Seek emergency attention.
Note that if the bleeding does not slow down or stop with these steps, you may need to go into the Emergency Room. Although most small cuts will stop bleeding within five or so minutes, if the blood keeps pouring out you will definitely want to see a doctor sooner rather than later as your cut will likely need professional medical attention, as well as possible stitches.

, Start by rinsing the cut with clear water and a mild cleanser. You do not need to use hydrogen peroxide or an iodine-containing cleanser. These may actually irritate the cut more than help it to heal. Simple soap and water is effective enough for the cleaning process.


Rinse for at least two minutes, and until the wound looks clean.

, However, be careful not to make the wound worse as you try to get things out of it. Note that if there is a significant amount of foreign material lodged in the cut, it is best to see a doctor rather than to attempt to get it out yourself. This is because failure to get it out may result in infection, or you may make the cut worse in your attempts to clear it all out.


Therefore, if cleaning the debris out of the cut is simple, you may do it yourself; however, if it looks daunting (or appears that you might cause further injury trying to get it out), see a doctor for professional help.
Again, if there is a large object imbedded in the wound (such as a knife left in a stab wound), leave it in place and get emergency assistance immediately.

, Apply a light covering over the entire wound. This not only helps to prevent bacterial infection, it also helps to moisturize the cut which can speed up healing.

, If it is just a small cut or scratch that looks like it will easily heal on its own, covering it may not be needed. However, if in doubt, use a bandage to be safe rather than sorry and to ensure the fastest healing. Be sure to change the bandage every 24 hours.


If the wound looks too big to be covered by a bandage, you may need to look for a larger bandage, or to see a doctor to wrap it if it is a large wound. Consider a compress and rolled gauze.

, A small cut or scratch is unlikely to be a significant worry. However, if in doubt, see your healthcare professional to discuss whether or not he advises a tetanus immunization at this time. If you have been immunized within the last 10 years, you will be fine as the shot is effective for 10 years.

Follow the instructions your doctor has given you.,
Wash your hands before and after cleaning the wound.,
Soak the wound in a saline solution (if advised).,
Use drinking-quality water to clean the wound.,
Apply an antibiotic ointment.,
Avoid using alcohol or hydrogen peroxide.,
Replace the dressing encourage healing.,
Follow all of your doctor's instructions.",How to Clean an Infected Wound1," The most important part of caring for a wound is following your doctor’s instructions. If you have not yet seen a doctor for a wound, then do so as soon as possible. Your doctor may advise you to:Keep your wound clean and dry.
Cover your wound when you bathe or shower to avoid getting it wet.
Clean your wound with soap and water or with a special wound cleaner.
Replace your bandages regularly and when they become dirty or wet.;
, Use an antimicrobial hand soap and warm water, and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds. Always wash your hands before and after cleaning the wound.Avoid touching the wound unless you’re cleaning it, and never scratch it if it’s itchy.

, If your doctor has advised you to soak your wound in a saline solution a certain number of times each day, then make sure that you do so. If not, then do not do this. Remove its dressing and soak a healing or closed infected wound in a container of warm saline solution for 20 minutes. If it’s not easy to soak the wound in a bowl, cover the wound with a clean cloth soaked in saline solution for 20 minutes.You can create your own saline solution by mixing two teaspoons of salt with one quart (about a liter) of warm water.

, If you wouldn’t drink the water you’re using to clean the wound, you shouldn’t use it. You can use distilled or filtered water, and heat it with salt on the stove.You can also just boil tap water and let it cool until it’s safe to use.

, Dab an antibacterial cream onto a cotton swab, taking care not to let the tip of the nozzle touch the swab. Use enough cream to apply a thin coating over the entire wound. Use a fresh swab if you need to squirt more ointment from the bottle.Use an over the counter cream if you haven’t been prescribed one from your doctor. You can also ask your pharmacist to recommend an over the counter antibiotic ointment.

, When it comes to treating wounds and skin infections, rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide actually do more harm than good. Both interfere with the processes of healing and fighting infection. They dry your skin and kill white blood cells, which your body uses to kill the germs that cause infection., After cleaning the wound and applying ointment, use a clean cloth to dry the area around the wound so you can affix the dressing. Covering the wound will encourage healing and prevent the infection from spreading.Avoid using a dressing that sticks to wound. Go for a sterile bandage instead of gauze., If your wound is infected, then you need to be under the care of a doctor. If you visited your doctor or another medical professional when you were injured or to treat an infection, be sure to follow all of their instructions. Apply prescribed topical antibiotic cream or take oral antibiotics as they've instructed.Take any other medications, such as pain relievers or anti-inflammatory drugs, as directed.
If you received stitches, don't get them wet for 24 hours unless directed by your doctor.

Wash your hands.,
Apply pressure to stop the bleeding.,
Wash the cut.,
Use an antibiotic cream.,
Put a bandage over the cut.",How to Clean a Minor Wound1," If you are going to be putting your hands near an open cut, whether on you or someone else, your hands should be clean. Wash with soap and water, and dry off before handling any bandages or ointments.If you don’t have water, antibacterial cleanser will do the trick in a pinch. Water is better, but the important thing is to keep your hands clean to avoid infecting the wound.
If disposable protective gloves are available, go ahead and use them. They aren’t necessary, but anything to help prevent infection is a good idea.;
, Make sure the cut isn’t bleeding anymore before you start to put on any ointments or bandages. Hold a sterile bandage or clean cloth on the cut until it clots and the bleeding stops.If the cut is really small, a tissue might be enough to soak up the blood. If you can get a clean cloth, though, that is better.
Don’t pull off the cloth or gauze to check on the wound until the bleeding has definitely stopped. That can cause the bleeding to restart.If blood starts to seep through, and the cloth or gauze has gotten soaked, don’t remove it from the cut. Simply add more on top, and keep up the pressure.

, Use water to rinse out the cut, and use soap to help clean the area around the cut. Try to keep soap out of the cut. Washing the cut is also important because it will let you see how big it is. If it is especially large or deep, contact a doctor before trying to apply a bandage on your own., Spread a thin layer of antibiotic cream over the cut to help prevent further infection. Something simple like Neosporin or Polysporin should be more than enough. Some people are allergic to certain ointments, which cause a mild rash to appear on the skin. If the person starts to get a rash, stop using the ointment.

, You can either apply a band-aid, or hold a piece of gauze there and wrap with medical tape or a larger bandage. This will help keep the wound clean and keep bacteria out.Make sure your bandage covers the entire wound. If there are parts that the bandage can’t cover, use another one.
If the wound is a scrape or scratch, and hasn’t broken the skin or drawn blood, you don’t need to apply a bandage.

Consider if stitches may be needed.,
Be on the lookout for signs of infection.These include redness and warmth around the cut, significant swelling, pus-like drainage from the area of the cut, and/or fever.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Clean Cuts2," When you examine the cut, it is important to assess whether the edges of the cut fit nicely together. In a small cut or scratch you have nothing to worry about. However, if you have an open wound and it is hard to pull the edges of the wound together, you will want to see a doctor to consider stitches. The advantage of stitches is that they hold the edges of the wound in place in exactly the position that is ideal for healing. Also, the sooner you receive stitches the better, as having them put in sooner rather than later (if they are needed) diminishes scarring and improves healing.

, See your doctor immediately if you suspect your cut may be infected.

, If the cut is severe enough to show tendons or ligaments, muscle, nerves, blood vessels, or bone, you should definitely see a doctor as this is considered a deep wound that merits medical attention.Also, if the bleeding does not stop, and/or if you have numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation, go to the Emergency Room immediately. All of these are signs of a more severe injury that warrant professional attention and evaluation.


Always see a doctor if you have been bitten by an animal.
Also see your physician if you have a puncture wound from stepping on a nail or other foreign object.
Both of these situations will require infectious disease precautions.

Check for a crooked limb.,
Look for swelling and redness.,
Try to assess the pain.,
Notice difficulty moving body parts.,
Ask about numbness and tingling.,
Don't move the fractured bone.,
Stop any bleeding.,
Immobilize the injured area.,
Monitor for circulation.,
Apply cold therapy if possible.,
Call for help.,
Survey the scene.,
Determine if the person is breathing.,
Watch for shock.",How to Check for a Fracture when Performing First Aid," While some serious fractures poke through the skin (called an open fracture), most remain hidden underneath the skin (called closed fractures).Take a look at the injured person's limbs and neck and check for unnatural angles or positions that likely indicate a fracture or dislocation. Look for a limb that looks shorter, twisted or bent in an unnatural looking way.


It's important not to move the neck, head or spine if it looks crooked or misaligned because you could cause permanent nerve damage and make the situation worse.
While looking for deformities, compare side-to-side (left leg to right leg, for example) to better notice anything strange or unusual that’s indicative of a broken bone.
Noticing an open fracture is much easier due to it poking out of the skin. Open fractures are considered more serious due to significant blood loss and risk of infection.
You may have to loosen or remove some clothes to check thoroughly, but make sure to ask permission if the person is conscious.;
, A fractured bone is a major injury that requires lots of force, so expect to see swelling, redness and/or bruising.The inflammation and color changes develop quickly near the fracture site, so you shouldn’t have to wait very long to see them. Again, some clothing removal is likely necessary to see swelling.


Swelling produces a visible lumpiness, inflating or ballooning of tissue around the broken bone, but don't mistake it for fat deposit. Swelling makes the skin tight and warm to the touch, whereas fat is jiggly and cool to the touch.
Swelling and color changes happen due to broken blood vessels that bleed into surrounding areas beneath the skin. Red, purple and dark blue are common colors associated with broken bones.
An open fracture causes external (visible) bleeding, which should be easy to see because it will soak through most types of fabrics pretty quickly.

, Although broken bones tend to be very painful (even small hairline / stress fractures), using pain to gauge an injury in an emergency situation can be tricky.First of all, the person may feel varying degrees of pain all over her body, depending on what happened to her. Secondly, the person may be unconscious or in shock and be unable to answer your questions or pinpoint any pain. So, certainly ask the injured person about her pain, but don't rely on it to check for a fracture.


Gently touch (palpate) the person's limbs and torso (especially around the ribs) and look for any wincing if she is conscious but not communicating clearly.
If the person is unconscious, then a pain assessment can't be done.
Pain sensations can be greatly enhanced (from fear) or reduced (from adrenaline) when people are hurt, so it's not always reliable for an injury assessment.

, If the injured person is conscious and alert, ask him to carefully and slowly move arms, hands, feet and legs. If he has lots of difficulty and pain with movement, then a fracture or dislocation is possible.You may also hear a grating or cracking noise, which indicates the broken pieces of the bone are rubbing together.


Ask him to start with wiggling his toes, then bending his knees, then lifting his legs off the ground, then moving his hands and arms.
Even if the person can move his limbs (suggesting the spinal cord has not been injured), there may be damage to the bones of the spine. Unless it is necessary to get the person out of immediate danger, patients should not be moved until assessed by a medical professional due to the risk of paralyzing a patient.
Loss of strength in a limb, even with some movement, is another indication of a fracture or dislocation, or a spine or nerve injury.

, Typically when a bone is broken, especially the larger upper bones of the arms and legs, nerves are also injured or at least stretched and irritated. This produces electric-like pain, but also numbness or ""pins and needles"" below the site of the injury.Ask the injured person about the sensations in her hands and feet.


Loss of sensation in the limbs indicate some type of nerve involvement, either in a peripheral nerve running down the leg / arm, or a spinal nerve within the spinal column.
In addition to numbness and pins and needles, she may also feel strange temperature changes — either too cold or burning hot sensations.

, If you think an injured person has a bone fracture (or dislocated joint), you should not move it in order to assess or treat it.Instead, you should continue with your basic first-aid treatment while the broken bone is in the position you found it or a more comfortable position chosen by the injured person. Without emergency medical training, moving a broken bone is just too risky.


Discourage the injured person from moving around too much. Slightly changing position for comfort is fine, but trying to get up (especially if he is in shock) risks further injury.
Supporting the injured body part for comfort or to stop the person from moving it is fine. Use a pillow, cushion or rolled up jacket or towel.

, There's not much you can do to stop the internal bleeding that invariably occurs with a closed fracture, but stopping or slowing down the bleeding from an open fracture is necessary and can be life saving.Apply pressure to the open wound with a sterile bandage, clean cloth or a clean piece of clothing until it stops bleeding and starts to clot — it can take up to five minutes or more, depending on the wound and which blood vessels are damaged.


Protect yourself and the patient from blood-borne disease by wearing gloves. Coming into contact with the injured person's blood puts you at risk for disease like hepatitis, HIV, and other viral infections.
Even if the fracture is closed, there may be surrounding cuts and abrasions that are bleeding and need attention.
For an open fracture, once the bleeding is under control, cover the wound with a sterile dressing or something clean (to help prevent infection and debris getting in there) and secure it with a bandage. Do not remove the bandage or cloth you used to stop the bleeding — simply lay the new dressing over the old.
You can lightly rinse the wound with water to remove any dirt or debris, but don't vigorously scrub it because it will make it bleed more.

, Never try to realign a broken bone or push it back into the body if it's sticking out. Instead, immobilize (secure) the broken bone with a splint or sling, particularly if you've had any sort of emergency medical training.Potential material you can use for splints include rolled up newspapers or strips of wood. Remember to immobilize the area both above and below the fracture.


Secure the splints around the arm or leg with elastic bandages (Ace or Tensor bandages), rope, a belt or strips of cloth or items of clothing. Don't tie it too tight and cut off circulation.
Padding the splints with cloth or large bandages can help reduce discomfort.
Consider making a simple sling to support a broken arm. Use a shirt and tie the sleeves around the person's neck for support.
If you have no idea what a splint or sling are, then it's likely best not to try to make them. Stick with bleeding control and waiting for emergency services.

, If you decide to support a broken leg or arm with a splint and secure it with an Ace bandage or belt, you need to check for circulation every few minutes until help arrives.Tying the splint on too tight cuts off blood supply to the tissues downstream from the injury and can lead to tissue death from lack of oxygen and nutrients.


Feel for a pulse in the wrist with a broken arm and the ankle area for a fractured leg. If you can't feel a pulse, loosen the ties on the splint and check again.
You can also check visually. Press firmly over the skin downstream from the fracture site. It should first ""blanch"" white and then turn pink again in about two seconds.
Signs of poor circulation include: pale or blueish skin, numbness or tingling and loss of pulse., If you have any ice, frozen gel packs or bags of frozen veggies near by, apply them over the covered wound to help reduce (or limit) inflammation and numb the pain.Ice causes the small blood vessels to shrink a little so swelling is reduced. Ice will also help stop the bleeding of an open wound.


Remember not to apply ice (or anything cold) directly to the skin. Always wrap the ice in a thin towel, piece of cloth or some other material before applying it to an injury.
Leave the ice on for about 15 minutes or until emergency medical personnel arrive.

, If you come across an emergency medical situation where people are injured, immediately call for an ambulance if nobody else has.Time is of the essence, so get help on the way first, then assess the injuries and deliver basic first aid while you're waiting for help to arrive. Precious lost minutes can make the difference between life and death, regardless of your level of first aid training.


Even if people are seemingly not seriously injured, you should still call 9-1-1 for help because you'll be unable to make an appropriate diagnosis due to either lack of training or necessary medical equipment.
No one expects you to play doctor and fix any injuries. Focus on getting help to arrive and doing the basics — stopping any serious bleeding, offering support and trying to prevent shock (see below).

, Before you approach the injured person to administer first aid, you need to take a moment to look around and make sure there is no immediate danger. If you rush into a scene without checking for threats to your safety — like a downed electrical wire, falling debris, or a dangerous person — you may become injured yourself. Then all you have accomplished is giving emergency personnel two people to rescue instead of one.

, Once trained emergency medical help is called and on the way, assess whether an injured person is unconscious and/or not breathing. If the person is not breathing, giving her CPR is your top priority.Check the person's airway to see if it's blocked before giving CPR. Don't check for broken bones until the person is revived and breathing.


If you do not have CPR training, you should not worry about administering rescue breaths — focus on chest compressions instead. If you are trained and confident in your abilities, then proceed with CPR that includes rescue breathing.Carefully position the person on her back and kneel next beside her, near her shoulders.
Place the heel of your hand on the person's breastbone, between her nipples. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and use all your body weight to press down on the chest.Administer chest compressions at a rate of about 100 pumps per minute (imagine pressing to the rhythm of the Bee Gee's song ""Stayin' Alive""). Give chest compressions until help arrives. If you become tired, see if someone can switch off with you.
If you are trained in CPR, then check the person's airway after 30 compressions and begin to deliver rescue breathing.

, Once help is on the way, the person is breathing, bleeding is under control and you've stabilized any broken bones, you need to remain vigilant for shock. Shock is a physiological response to loss of blood, injury and pain, which can quickly become fatal if not properly addressed.Signs to look out for include: feeling faint, rapid shallow breathing, low blood pressure, confusion, strange / inappropriate behavior, loss of consciousness.


To combat shock: control bleeding first, lay the person down with his head slightly lower than his torso, elevate his legs, keep him warm with a blanket and offer him liquids to drink if he is able.Calm him down by not panicking yourself and make sure he knows that help is on the way.
Reassure him that he'll be okay (even if you don't think he will be) and distract him from looking at his injuries.

Stop the bleeding.,
Flush a fresh wound for up to 10 minutes.,
Apply an antibiotic ointment and dress the wound.,
Check for signs of infection.",How to Clean an Infected Wound2," Minor wounds, like surface scrapes or shallow cuts, usually stop bleeding on their own after a few minutes. If necessary, cover the area with a clean cloth or bandage and apply gentle pressure. Elevate the wound if possible, so the area is held higher than the heart.For example, if you have an arm or leg injury, elevate the limb to hold the wound at a higher point than your heart.

, Run warm water over a scrape or cut to remove debris and germs. Clean around the wound with a wash cloth and mild soap or saline solution. Start cleaning the wound as soon as possible to prevent infection.Soak a puncture wound for 15 minutes in a warm saline solution to flush debris.
If necessary, dip a pair of tweezers in alcohol to sanitize them, and use them to remove particles of debris from a scrape or cut that you can’t flush with water. Consult a doctor if you can’t remove any debris from a puncture wound or deep cut.

, Use a cotton swab to cover the wound with a thin coating of antibiotic ointment. Dress the wound with a sterile bandage. If necessary, use a clean cloth to dry the area around the wound so the bandage can adhere.Be sure to change the dressing at least once a day or whenever it comes damp or dirty.
If the wound doesn’t become infected, just clean it with saline solution at least once daily or whenever you change the dressing.

, As you care for your wound, make sure to check it often for signs of an infection and call your doctor if you notice any of these signs. These signs may include:

Redness
Swelling
Heat (increased temperature at the wound site)
Pain
Tenderness
Pus

"
"
Have deeper wounds sutured.,
Make an appointment if the infection worsens.,
Discuss topical or oral antibiotics with your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about getting a tetanus shot.,
Consult a doctor about chronic conditions and other concerns.,
Seek immediate medical care for severe symptoms.",How to Clean an Infected Wound3," If the wound completely punctures through the skin or is wider than two millimeters, you should consult a doctor or visit an emergency clinic. If you have trouble closing the wound on your own or can see any exposed muscle or fat, you will likely need stitches.Getting stitches within a few hours of the injury will reduce the risk of scarring and infection.
Keep in mind that wounds with jagged edges are more likely to become infected, so make sure you see a doctor if you have this type of wound.

, Call a doctor immediately if redness and swelling spread beyond the wound or infected site. If you’ve already seen your doctor, call them for a follow-up if a fever persists for two days after starting an antibiotic, or if the infected wound shows no signs of improvement for three days after starting an antibiotic. Signs of a worsening infection may include:Increased swelling
Red streaks traveling away from the wound
A foul odor coming from the wound
Increased amounts of pus and fluid coming from the wound
Fever
Chills
Nausea and/or vomiting
Swollen lymph nodes

, When you have your doctor examine the infected wound, discuss whether you should take topical or oral antibiotics. A topic antibiotic is an ointment that you apply directly on the infected area and is the most common form of treatment.Oral antibiotics, or systemic antibiotics, are taken by the mouth and are best if your doctor believes the infection is spreading or if your immune system is compromised. Tell your doctor about fever or any other symptoms, and be sure to mention any chronic health conditions or medications that might have weakened your immune system., It’s always best to talk to a doctor about getting a tetanus shot if the wound is deep or dirty. Puncture wounds from soiled or rusty surfaces can cause tetanus, but most standard vaccination programs protect against the disease. If you haven’t had a tetanus shot in the last five years, you might need a booster., You should contact your doctor immediately if you have any concerns about the nature of your injury or about your existing medical conditions.

For example, be sure to consult a doctor if you take a prescription blood thinner or if your immune system is compromised.
In addition to wounds from rusty or soiled objects, it's best to see a doctor for wounds from animal or human bites or with hard to remove debris.Also, keep in mind that some people are at an increased risk of infection, such people who are diabetic, elderly, obese, or immunocompromised (those who have HIV/AIDS, are undergoing chemotherapy, or who are on a steroid medication).

, In some situations, you may need to seek immediate medical care. Symptoms that indicate a need for immediate care include:Feeling short of breath
Having a rapid heartbeat
Feeling confused
Having excessive bleeding that soaks through your bandages
Feeling like your wound is ripping or noticing that it has actually come apart
Having severe pain
Noticing red streaks coming from the infected area

"

Wash your hands and stop the bleeding.,
Rinse the wound under running water.,
Look for anything in the wound.,
Put a bandage over the cut.",How to Clean a Minor Wound2," Wash up with soap and water to help prevent infections. Then hold a clean cloth or bandage over the wound until the bleeding stops.Don’t pull off the cloth or gauze to check on the wound until the bleeding has definitely stopped. That can cause the bleeding to restart.If blood starts to seep through, and the cloth or gauze has gotten soaked, don’t remove it from the cut. Simply add more on top, and keep up the pressure.

, A puncture wound is going to be deeper than a cut. You’ll need to hold it under the water about 5 minutes to really rinse it out. Once you are finished, wash the area around the wound with soap., This could be dirt, splinters, the object that caused the wound, really anything that shouldn’t be there. You don’t want any foreign object in the wound, as it could lead to an infection, or prevent proper healing. However, if the puncture is deep and has the object that caused it still inside, leave that object in and go to the hospital. Removing it will cause more bleeding.


If you do find something, don’t use your fingers to remove it. Instead, a pair of tweezers cleaned in rubbing alcohol should be enough to get out bits that won’t wash away.Be careful not to poke in the wound. Reaching your finger, or the tweezers, or anything else into the puncture wound will only make it worse., Put a thin layer of antibiotic cream over the cut before you put on the bandage. Make sure the bandage goes directly over the wound.If the cut continues to bleed, replace the bandage as needed to keep it fresh. You should also contact your doctor for additional treatment.

Understand the differences between cuts, scratches, and abrasions.","How to Check out Cuts, Scratches and Abrasions1","



Cuts: These are injuries to the skin caused by something sharp, like a knife.

Scratches: These are slight injuries that happen when a sharp object (like a fingernail or thorn) scrapes along your skin the way a pencil scrapes across paper.

Abrasions: These are scrapes that happen when the skin is rubbed away. For example, you might get a ""rug burn"" while wrestling with your brother, or a ""board burn"" if you wipe out on your skateboard when you aren't wearing knee-pads.

Stand.,
Move your friend's arm.",How to Carry Someone Who's Bigger Than You1," Ask your friend to stand next to you, facing your right shoulder. You'll be picking him up with the ""fireman's carry,"" which can make it surprisingly easy.;
, Shift your right leg so it is between your friend's feet. Put more weight on this leg, so it is ready to support your friend.

, Bring your left hand across your chest to grasp your friend's right wrist or forearm. Lift your friend's arm over your head and duck forward, placing it across your neck and shoulders.When finished, you should be bent forward slightly, with our left hand back on your left side. Maintain a firm grip on your friend's arm.

, Carefully move your right arm off the other person. Now squat slightly, keeping your back as straight as you can while supporting the weight of the larger person. When you're low enough to reach his legs, slip your right arm between his knees. Grasp the back and side of his right knee with your hand.


Your left hand should keep a firm grip on his right arm this whole time.

, You should now have a firm grip on his right forearm and the back of his right knee. Use these grips to pull him onto your shoulders. When you're finished, he should be positioned like this:


His legs dangle in front of your right shoulder. Your hand is firmly and easily gripping one knee.
His torso is mostly straight across your shoulders.
His right arm is pulled in front of you.

, Lift with your legs and hips, never your back. Keep your back as straight as possible, bent forward just enough to support your friend. If necessary, adjust your friend to balance his weight more evenly.

, Move your friend's right arm across your chest. With your other hand, let go of your friend's knee and wrap your arm around his leg. Grasp your friend's right arm with your right hand. Your left hand should now be free to help you balance as you walk around."

Know what's in your water.,
Familiarize yourself with essential macronutrients.,
Choose the right micronutrients.,
Check your water temperature.,
Keep the right pH balance.,
Fill your containers with water.,
Measure out the nutrients.,
Rest a funnel into the mouth of the reservoir.,
Add the nutrients to the water.,
Cap and shake the container.",How to Mix Hydroponics Nutrients," Send your water to a lab to be tested, if you can. With good, ""soft"" water, you'll be able to add any nutrients your plants need for their optimal growing season. With ""hard"" water, you may need to use reverse osmosis methods to filter out any unwanted heavy metals present in your water.


You can also use a dissolved solids meter to check your water regularly. This is also called an electrical conductivity (EC) or parts per million (PPM) meter.
Calcium and magnesium carbonates are quite common ingredients in both tap water and well water. Each are necessary nutrients for plant growth, but in limited amounts. Knowing how much of these elements are present in your water determines how much, if any, you need to add.;
, The essential nutrients used include calcium nitrate, potassium sulphate, potassium nitrate, mono potassium phosphate, and magnesium sulphate. Each element involved in these nutrients provides a different benefit.Hydrogen forms water by combining with the oxygen.
Nitrogen and sulfur are essential to the supply of amino acids and proteins.
Phosphorus is used in photosynthesis and overall growth.
Potassium and magnesium act as catalysts in the creation of starches and sugars.
Magnesium and nitrogen also play a role in the production of chlorophyll.
Calcium is a part of the make-up of cell walls, and plays a role in the growth of cells.

, Micronutrients, also called trace elements, are also essential, but they are only required in very small amounts. These elements effect growth, reproduction, and the effect that other nutrients have on the plant.


Micronutrients used include boron, chlorine, copper, iron, manganese, sodium, zinc, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, and silicon.
There should be at least 10 trace elements present in your nutrient mix., The best temperature for plants is tepid: neither warm nor cold to the touch. If your solution is too cold, your plants won't germinate. They may mold or rot. If your solution is too hot, your plants might die from stress or oxygen deficiency. The optimal temperature for water is between 65 degrees (18 C) and 80 degrees (27 C).


Plants grown in colder climates will thrive in cooler water, while plants grown in warmer regions prefer warmer water.
When you add new water to your reservoir, make sure it's approximately the same temperature as the existing reservoir water.

, You can use a pH meter to check your balance. You want your pH balance to be between 5.5 and 7.0. Your water's pH balance ultimately impacts the plants' ability to take in nutrients.


It's normal for pH balances to wander up and down. The balance will naturally change as elements are absorbed by the plants. Avoid adding too many chemicals as a reaction to the varying pH balance.
If you have poor quality growing medium, this may affect the stability of your pH balance.
Most municipal water systems raise the pH level of their water by adding calcium carbonate. The average pH balance of city water is often as high as 8.0.
Remember that pH measuring kits will show different levels in different temperatures. Check your water temperature before adding chemicals to your water.

, Most hydroponic recipes call for 2-3 reservoirs. Make sure your containers are food-grade. If you can, use distilled water or water that has been run through a reverse osmosis system. Tap water often contains ions and other elements that can prove harmful to a hydroponics system.For a smaller nutrient reservoir, an empty 1 gallon (4 liter) milk jug works well. For a larger amount, a use a 5 gallon water container.
If you can't find either distilled water, let your water sit open for 24 hours to allow any chlorine to dissipate.
If you plan to use tap water, get it tested to learn what's in it.

, In a 2-container reservoir system, you'll want to have 1 container with crop-specific nutrients, such as potassium nitrate or individual micronutrient chelates. The other container may be filled with a premixed fertilizer or another general nutrient blend.Use a plastic chemical scoop and sterilized filter paper to hold dry chemicals. Measure liquid nutrients in a graduated cylinder or beaker.
For example, for a full 5-gallon (20-liter) container of water, measure out 5 teaspoons (25 ml) of CaNO3, 1/3 teaspoon (1.7 ml) of K2SO4, 1 2/3 teaspoons (8.3 ml) KNO3, 1 1/4 teaspoon (6.25 ml) of KH2PO4, 3 1/2 teaspoons (17.5 ml) MgSO4, and 2/5 teaspoon (2 ml) trace element compound.

, You can mix the nutrients even without a funnel, but doing so could result in spills that could upset the nutritional balance of the solution. Using a small plastic funnel makes it easier to pour the chemicals into the container.Some nutrients and other additives can be irritating or harmful to the skin. Using a funnel should help you avoid spills.
Check the pH of the water in your hydroponics system after adding the nutrients. Hydroponics nutrients usually lower the pH balance of neutral water, so you may need to use pH additive to realign the balance afterward.

, Pour the nutrients in one by one, going slowly to prevent overflow, spills, or similar loss of nutrients. A slight loss of nutrients will not cause severe damage to your system, but the sooner your plants can adjust to the nutrient supply, the more effective the solution will be.The amount of nutrient solution you need will mostly depend on the reservoir your hydroponics unit uses. There is no precise way to determine the amount, and figuring it out may require experimentation.
In general, you should use at least enough solution so that the reservoir pump does not suck in air once the pump turns on.

, Make sure that the cap is securely screwed on or snapped into place. Shake the container using both hands for 30 to 60 seconds to combine the nutrients. If the cap cannot be fixed on tight, you may need to hold it down with one or two fingers as you shake.Note that if the container is too large or heavy to shake, you can stir the mixture with a long dowel or other rod.
Shaking often proves the most thorough way to combine the ingredients, but stirring will also work as long as you do it for a greater length of time.

After getting a cut, scratch, or abrasion, your skin may start bleeding.,
At the site of a wound, in this case, a cut, the platelets stick together like glue.,
Underneath the scab, new skin cells multiply to repair the wound.","How to Check out Cuts, Scratches and Abrasions2"," This happens because the injury breaks or tears the tiny blood vessels that live right under the skin's surface. Your body wants to stop the bleeding, so the platelets in your blood come to the rescue.;
, This is called clotting, which works like a plug to keep blood and other fluids from leaking out. A scab (a hardened and dried clot) forms a crust over the wound. This protects the area so the cells underneath can have time to heal.

, Damaged blood vessels are repaired, and infection-fighting white blood cells attack any germs that may have gotten into the wound. You can't see it under the scab, but a new layer of skin is forming. When the new skin is ready, the scab falls off. A scab usually falls off within a week or two. If you pick at a scab, the new skin underneath can be ripped and the wound will take longer to heal (and it may leave a scar). Try not to pick at scabs.

"
"
Stop any bleeding by pressing a clean, soft cloth against the wound.,
Most small cuts, scrapes, or abrasions will heal well without any special care.","How to Check out Cuts, Scratches and Abrasions3"," If the wound isn't very bad, the bleeding should stop in a few minutes. Then, you'll want to clean the wound using warm water and a gentle soap.

, For extra protection, you can use an antibacterial ointment or a bandage. Antibacterial ointment will kill germs. A bandage will keep your wound from getting irritated and will prevent germs from getting inside. If you use a bandage, it should be changed daily and when it gets wet or dirty.

"
"
If a wound is very long or deep, or if its edges are far apart, you may need stitches.,
The doctor will suture or sew the edges of the cut together with a small needle and special thread.

,
For more minor cuts, the doctor might use a special kind of glue (instead of stitches) to close your cut.,
If you get stitches, you will need to go back to the doctor in about a week to get those stitches taken out.,
Sometimes, a small scar forms after stitches are removed.","How to Check out Cuts, Scratches and Abrasions4"," The doctor will use some type of anesthetic on your skin to numb it. This numbing medicine might be applied directly, or through a shot.

,, This glue holds the sides of the cut together so the skin can begin to heal. The glue will dissolve over time.

, The doctor will just snip the thread with scissors and gently pull out the threads. It feels funny, but it usually doesn't hurt.

, If you don't get the proper care for a serious cut, a more noticeable scar may form.

"
"
Bites and scratches may need special care, because germs from the animal or person might have gotten into the wound.,
Certain cuts or bites could develop into tetanus, another serious illness.,
Sometimes, a cut, scratch, or abrasion starts out as no big deal, but then it gets infected.,
Most often, your cuts, scratches, and abrasions go away on their own, thanks to your body's amazing ability to heal itself.

","How to Check out Cuts, Scratches and Abrasions5"," The doctor might prescribe an antibiotic medicine to prevent infection. If you were bitten or scratched by an animal, you will need to make sure that the animal didn't have rabies, a dangerous virus.

, Your parent will need to check your medical records and be sure that you have had a tetanus shot recently.

, An infection happens when there are too many germs for your body's white blood cells to handle. Infected wounds may hurt, look red and swollen, and contain pus, which is a thick yellowish or greenish liquid. If your cut, scratch, or abrasion looks infected, you should talk to someone. You may need to see a doctor for antibiotics to get rid of the infection.

Carry someone out of a car.,
Drag someone by the legs.,
Drag someone by the shoulders.,
Carry the victim only when absolutely necessary.",How to Carry Someone Who's Bigger Than You2," A possibly injured victim should be left in place whenever possible, since moving may cause injury. If the car is burning or there is another reason the victim must move immediately, follow these instructions:Move the victim's legs clear of the pedals.
Rotate the victim so her back faces the open car door.
Lock your arms under her armpits and in front of her chest.
Drag the victim to a safe location, supporting her head with your body.
If her legs or feet catch on the car, slowly lower her to the ground, lift her legs out by hand, then drag using the next step.

, If the ground is smooth and there are no obvious leg injuries, use this technique to move the victim out of the danger area. Crouch low and grab the patient's ankles. Lean back and pull the victim to safety.Leaning back uses your own body weight as leverage, allowing you to drag someone much heavier than yourself.


To reduce the risk of self-injury, do not extend your arms more than 15–20 inches (38–51cm). Flex your arms slowly backwards, then reposition yourself before pulling again.Some first aid agencies do not like this method because it drags the victim's head along the ground.For this reason, never use it on rough ground.

, Bend over next to the top of the person's head. Grasp the victim's clothing underneath the shoulders, supporting her head with your arm. Drag backward.


Alternatively, pull the victim's arms above her head. Grip the elbows, pressing them against the victim's head to support it. Use this method if the victim's clothing is torn or weak., Carrying someone is a last resort in an emergency. It can make an injury worse, or expose the victim to smoke inhalation during a fire.Use it only when immediate movement is necessary, and dragging is not possible.


If the victim is unconscious, it can take considerable strength to lift her to a standing position. To do this, roll the person onto her stomach. Kneel at the top of her head, and place both arms under her armpits. Grasp her back and stand by pushing with your legs, keeping both your backs as straight as possible.Once the victim is in a standing position, you can follow the instructions under ""carrying a friend.""
Alternatively, give a ""piggyback ride"" by crossing the victim's arms in front of your chest and balancing the victim's weight on your hips. This may be safer if the victim is injured, but it is still not ideal."

Research on the internet about names of drugs etc.,
Understand the drug's use.,
Use inspiration.,
Naming new thing's is generally from the person's last or first name depending on what they choose so it is noting the person who made it.,
Use aesthetics to name your drug.,
Check to see if it actually sounds right and if it attracts customers.,
Use your own imagination.,
Know your limits.,
Be happy about your new name.",How to Name a New Drug," It is very important to research on names before continuing on any of the other steps. It is one way to actually get an idea of what to name it, how, why etc. and to create a great name.;
, It is significant to know whether the drug you are naming is suitable for anyone's use or purpose and if it is available to go on a market. Remember that drugs don't necessarily have to be 'new' to make a new name, it can be a duplicate of another medicine with a different name.


You need to know what function it does and how it does it etc. before finishing the steps below.

, Inspiration is a big factor of our lives so why can't it be for medicine? Don't copy names from other brands but use them for the same concept. It is important to know how you are using this as an inspiration or not.


Know your limits, if you completely make the medicine's name a duplicate of another's except with different spellings, people might think your brand is fake etc.

, You can do this to the drug but it might be a little too weird to do so but you can if you want.


Remember not to only name the medicine with your name, you have to expand it further to make it sound fresh. So, for example is your name was: Halcyon, you might make it 'Halcyonya' or something.

, Identify them by the surface, reaction time etc. It doesn't generally have to be in the name of the drug but can be included in the sub-title. For example: 'Halcyonya Fast' - it can be two versions of the medicine so you can earn more profit when it does go on the market.

, Your target is to make the name much more noticeable so make sure it's easy to pronounce and not very scientific.

, If you really have no ideas, just name your drug what ever you want it to be. Make it sound really surreal or unique names that are really creative in such a way. It's actually a good idea to ask some people for help instead of coming up with ideas with your self.

, If you say that the drug reacts fast etc. but it actually doesn't, people will not trust your brand and therefore making your brand-name sound very bad.


Make sure the new name you choose is not copyrighted or too similar to an existing name.

, Be wary if you change the name of the pill because people might not now that it was originally this brand. Only change it if people already know if it is bad quality etc.

Use rolled-up towels or blankets as cushions.,
Alternatively, put cushioning underneath the current crutch pad.,
Consider investing in a set of commercial crutch pads.,
Consider cushioning the grip areas as well.,
Adjust your crutches to the correct height.,
Make sure you're holding the crutches correctly.,
Pay attention to your gait.,
Let your body ""follow through"" with each step.,
Take extra care on stairs.",How to Make Your Crutches More Comfortable," One of the oldest, simplest, and most effective ways to make a pair of crutches more comfortable is to make improvised cushions from spare pieces of fabric. There's no ""right"" fabric for the job — you can use towels, pieces of an old blanket, or even small pillows. Below is an example of how you might do this for a pair of crutches:


Cut out two 3 feet (0.91 m) by 3 feet (0.9 m) pieces of an old blanket.
Roll both pieces of fabric into loose rolls that are slightly wider than the top portions of the crutches.
Use a sturdy tape (like packing tape or duct tape) to tape each roll over the top of one of the crutches. Tape the fabric in place tightly — if it slides around while you move, it can affect your posture and lead to further discomfort.;
, Many crutches come with a removable foam pad on top that's meant to fit under your arm. Another way to add cushioning to an uncomfortable set of crutches is to take these pads off, stuff them with cushioning material, and put them back on. This may be difficult or impossible for some crutches, so be careful not to damage your crutches by forcing the pads off or on.


You can use wadded-up fabric to cushion your crutches in this way, or other materials like cotton, stuffing from an old comforter, and so on.

, It's no secret in the medical community that crutches can be uncomfortable. Because of this, there is a small market for cushioning devices that can be used to make crutches more comfortable. These are usually made from foam, gel, or a breathable fabric material and are reasonably affordable — a complete set often goes for about $30.You can purchase basic crutch accessories at many pharmacies, but for a better selection of products, it may be wiser to go online, where you have access to a huge variety of materials, sizes, patterns, and so on. Shopping online, you can even buy high-fashion crutch pads, like sets made from faux fur.

, Your underarms aren't the only parts of your body that can get sore when you're using crutches. Since you're supporting much of your weight on your palms, it's also common for the hands to start hurting during crutch use. Luckily, cushioning the grip bars can reduce this discomfort somewhat.


You can use improvised cushions (taped towels or rags) or commercial pads for this. However, the latter may be the be the better choice, since it's important that you're able to have a firm grip on your crutches to avoid a fall. Many commercial crutch pads feature ergonomic materials and shapes designed to give you a better grip on the crutches.
Cushioning the grip area can be even more important on forearm crutches, since these put more of your weight on your hands.

, Even cushioned crutches can be a pain to use if they don't fit you properly. Luckily, nearly all modern crutches have easy-to-use telescoping portions that allow you to adjust the height. The proper height for your crutches depends on how tall you are — see below to learn how to adjust your crutches to the right height.Underarm crutches: Wear the shoes that you use for day-to-day life and stand upright. Slide the crutches under your arms and put the tips a few inches in front of your feet. Adjust the crutches so that they rest just an inch or two beneath your armpits. A friend can help here. The crutches should not jut up into your armpits.

Forearm crutches: Wear the shoes that you use for day-to-day life and stand upright. Slide the crutches onto your arms and grasp the handles. Flex your elbow so that the inside of your wrist is level with your hip at about a 30 degree angle. Adjust the crutch so that it touches the floor in this position. The armrest should support the largest part of your forearm and the handle should be level with your wrist.

, Wrist or hand pain can be a sign that you're holding the crutches in a way that puts unnecessary stress on these parts of your body. Using proper grip form should minimize this pain. See below for more information:



Both types of crutches: You should maintain a slight bend in your elbows while you use your crutches. Your forearms should be straight from the elbow through the wrist. Don't curl your wrists as you use the crutches.

, Having an off-kilter gait when walking normally can be a sign of other underlying problems and can lead to persistent, long-lasting pain.These problems are exacerbated when using crutches, which modify your normal gait by design. Maintaining proper posture throughout the walking motion is crucial to your ongoing comfort. See below for instructions — you will see that they are similar for both types of crutches:Underarm crutches: Grasp the crutches securely. Stand on your uninjured leg and set the crutches one step ahead. Lean forward as you use the crutches to swing yourself forward. Land on your uninjured leg about a step ahead of where your crutches touch the ground. Swing the crutches forward and repeat. Keep your injured leg off of the ground at all times.

Forearm crutches: Grasp the crutches securely. Stand on your uninjured leg and set the crutches one step ahead. Lean forward, put your weight onto the crutches, and swing your body forward. Use your forearms to maintain your balance and control during the swinging motion. Land on your uninjured leg about a step ahead of where your crutches touch the ground. As above, keep your injured leg of of the ground at all times.

, Taking steps with a set of crutches can take some getting used to before you're able to do it in a way that doesn't put any unnecessary stress on your joints. As you make contact with the ground, landing on your uninjured foot, try to keep your joints (especially your elbows and the knee on your uninjured leg) ""loose"" without collapsing your posture. Allowing your joints to bend slightly with each step will take some of the stress of walking off of them, preventing discomfort.


You don't want to have stiff or locked joints when you make contact with the ground. This increases the physical ""impact"" your joints feel with each step and will quickly cause soreness.

, It's no wonder that certain everyday tasks become extra-hard when you're using crutches. Knowing the proper way to go about doing these tasks won't just keep you more comfortable — it will also minimize the chance for injuries. For instance, climbing a set of stairs can be harrowing on crutches, so use the following mnemonics to help you remember how to accomplish this task:


Step on the GAS going up. First, step with your good leg, then lift your affected leg, then move your sticks
Let yourself SAG going down. First, move your sticks, then move your affected leg, then step with your good leg.

Troubleshoot if the oximeter makes an error.",How to Measure Oxygen Saturation Using Pulse Oximeter," Oxygen is breathed into the lungs. The oxygen then passes into the blood where the majority of the oxygen attaches to hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein located inside our red blood cells that transports the oxygen through the bloodstream to the rest of our body and tissues. In this way, our body is given the oxygen and nutrients it needs to function., Pulse oximetry is used to assess oxygen saturation in the blood for a variety of reasons. It is often used in surgeries and other procedures that involve sedation (such as a bronchoscopy) and to make any adjustments of supplemental oxygen. A pulse oximeter may also be used to assess whether an adjustment of supplemental oxygen is needed, whether lung medications are working effectively, and to determine patient tolerance to increased activity levels.Your physician may also recommend pulse oximetry if you use a ventilator to support breathing, suffer from sleep apnea or have a serious medical condition, such as heart attack, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, lung cancer, asthma, or pneumonia., Oximeters use the light absorptive characteristics of hemoglobin and the pulsating nature of blood flow in the arteries to measure the level of oxygen in the body.


A device called a probe has a light source, light detector, and microprocessor, which compares and calculates the differences in oxygen-rich versus oxygen-poor hemoglobin.One side of the probe contains a light source with two different types of light: infrared and red. These two types of light are transmitted through the body's tissues to the light detector on the other side of the probe. Hemoglobin that is more saturated with oxygen absorbs more of the infrared light, while hemoglobin without oxygen absorbs more of the red light.The microprocessor in the probe calculates the differences and converts the information to a digital value. This value is then assessed to determine the amount of oxygen being carried in the blood.Measurements of relative light absorption are made multiple times every second. These measurements are then processed by the machine to give a new reading every 0.5-1 second. The readings of the last 3 seconds are then averaged out., In general, the risks associated with pulse oximetry are minimal.If using the oximeter for a prolonged time, you may experience tissue breakdown at the site where the probe is applied (e.g., finger, ear). Skin irritation can sometimes occur when using adhesive-containing probes.There may be other risks depending upon your medical health and any specific conditions you may have. Consult your doctor if you have any concerns before beginning the procedure.

, Several different types of pulse oximeters are available. The most popular are portable handheld and fingertip pulse oximeters.


Portable pulse oximeters can be purchased from a wide array of stores, including drugstores like Walgreens and CVS, big-box stores like Walmart, and even online.
Most pulse oximeters are clip-like and look like a clothespin. There are also adhesive probes that can be placed on your finger or forehead.Appropriately sized probes should be used for children and infants., Plug oximeter into grounded wall outlet if the unit is not portable. If the unit is portable, ensure sufficient battery charge by turning it on before using.

, Unless you are to have continuous monitoring, the probe will be removed after the test., For example, if you plan to apply the oximeter to your finger, it's important that you remove anything that absorbs light (such as dried blood or nail polish) to avoid false low readings., The cold can cause poor perfusion, or blood flow, which in turn can lead the oximeter to make an error in its reading. Make sure the finger, ear, or forehead is room-temperature or slightly warm before beginning the procedure., High levels of ambient light, such as overhead lights, phototherapy lights and infrared warmers, can blind the light sensor and give you an inaccurate reading. Troubleshoot by reapplying the sensor or shielding the sensor with a towel or blanket., This will reduce transmission of microorganisms and body secretions.

, Probes are usually placed on the finger. Turn the oximeter on.


Probes can also be placed on the earlobe and forehead, although research suggests that the earlobe is not a reliable site for the measurement of oxygen saturation.If a finger probe is used, the hand should be rested on the chest at the level of the heart rather than the affixed digit held in the air (as patients commonly do). This helps to minimize any motion. Minimize movement. The most common cause of inaccurate oximeter readings is excessive movement. One way to make sure that motion isn't affecting the reading is to check that the displayed heart rate matches the heart rate when you check it manually. The two rates should be within 5 beats/minute of each other., Your oxygen saturation level and pulse rate are displayed in seconds on a lighted display screen. A range of 95% to 100% is generally considered normal. If your oxygen level drops below 85%, you should seek medical attention.

, Print out readings, and/or download them onto a computer if your oximeter has this capability.

, If you believe that your oximeter has given an imprecise or inaccurate reading, try the following:Make sure there is no interference (environmental or on the probe site directly).
Warm and rub skin.
Apply a topical vasodilator that will help open the blood vessels (e.g., glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) cream).
Try an alternative probe site.
Try a different probe and/or oximeter.
If you're still uncertain whether the oximeter is functioning properly, consult your physician.

Create a sachet.",How to Make Smelling Salts," Epsom salt, which forms half of the base of aromatherapy smelling salts, is not an actual salt but instead a natural compound of Magnesium and Sulfate Heptahydrate.Using dry measuring cups, measure 1.25 cups of it, and pour it into a medium-sized, metal, hard plastic or glass bowl.Take the rest and store it in an airtight container so you can make a variety of smelling salt blends later.


You want to use a metal, hard plastic or glass bowl so that when you later add the oil, they won’t absorb into the bowl, which would happen to one degree or another in a wooden bowl.
Epsom salt is cheap. You can buy a 2 pound box of Epsom salt for about $2 at pharmacies and at big-box stores.
A 5 pound bag costs about $5, which would leave you plenty for a nice bath soak and a whiff of one of your smelling salt blends.;
, Created through a process of water evaporation, sea salt isn’t heavily refined like table salt, leaving it coarser. That’s one reason it, along with Epsom salt, work well as a base for smelling salts – they’re both able to absorb the essential oils that are added to them. You will want to measure 3/4 of a tablespoon of the sea salt and add it to the Epsom salt.


There are two kinds of sea salt – fine-grind and flaked. Either will work, but because flaked sea salt has less moisture, it will better absorb the oil., Using a metal spoon, stir them until they are well blended. You should see the sparkle of the sea salt crystals throughout the mixture.Alternatively, if you are using a glass bowl with a tight-fitting lid, put the lid on and shake really well until the salts are thoroughly mixed.


Another option would be to use a fairly large and thoroughly washed plastic container with a lid, such as those used to hold sour cream, to put the salts in and then shake together.
You want to use a metal spoon when mixing for the same reason as you want to use a metal, hard plastic or glass bowl. Later, when you add the essential oils, they won’t soak into a metal spoon.

, Do you want to be more alert and invigorated? Do you want to de-stress? Do you have trouble sleeping? Once you decide, do an online search such as “energizing essential oils” to create a list of essential oils with this effect or characteristic.Other examples of words to include in your search are calming, soothing, uplifting, clarifying, purifying and so forth.
You can also do searches such as “essential oils for headaches” or “essential oils for depression.”

, When you first learn to blend essential oils, it’s best to stick to just a small number as things can go from fresh to foul fast. To make sure they will compliment each other, you must determine the category under which each of your listed essential oils falls. You can figure this out by doing an online search for ""essential oil categories"" or something similar. For each of the oils your search revealed and that you now have listed, write its category name beside it.


The nine categories are: floral, woodsy, earthy, herbaceous, minty, medicinal/camphorous, spicy, oriental and citrus.As a rule of thumb, oils from the same category generally blend well together.
Additionally, florals blend well with spicy, citrusy and woodsy oils. Woodsy blends well with all categories. Spicy and oriental oils blend well with floral, oriental, and citrus. Minty oils blend with citrus, woodsy, herbaceous and earthy oils., Essential oils are further divided by notes – top, middle and base notes – to create what is called a synergistic blend. Top notes evaporate the fastest and are sharp and refreshing; middle notes are warm and help equalize a blend; and base notes are heavier and help hold the blends essence longer.Taking your list of essential oils, next write down the note of each oil beside its name.


You can also find them listed by note type online. Or you can check out a book from your local library that will list both categories and types.

, Through the process of elimination, take your list and select one oil from each note, ensuring that all oils you choose are from categories that blend well together. Finding the aroma that appeals most to you will require experimentation. Blending essential oils is certainly more art than science. Here are some blends created specifically for this article that meet the criteria for notes and categorization.


Energizing/mental alertness blend: peppermint (Mentha piperita) as the top note, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) as the middle note and Peru balsam (Myroxylon pereirae) as the bottom note.
Relaxing/anti-stress blend: lavender (Lavender angustifolia) as the top note, ylang ylang (Cananga odorata var genuine) as the middle note and vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) as the base note.
Soothing/sleeplessness blend: bergamot (Citrus bergamia) as the top note, roman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis) as the middle note and sandalwood (Santalum album) as the base note.
Combat colds/clear sinuses blend: First, therapeutic blends do not need to follow, and typically don’t, the rules of keys and categories of aromatic blends. There are a variety of therapeutic blends, which you can search for online. Here is one, also created for this article: eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus), which acts as an expectorant and to relieve congestion; ravensara (Ravensara aromatica), which acts as an antibacterial, antimicrobial and anti-allergenic agent; and bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), which acts as an antioxidant and antiseptic., Start with a blend of 10, 20 or 25 total drops of oil as essential oils can not only be quite expensive but you also will be experimenting at first. You will want to use the following ratio for aromatic blends: 30-50-20, in which 30% of your blend will be from your top note oil, 50% from your middle note oil and 20% from your base note oil.Later you will add 6 drops of oil to the mixed salts, so to make the energizing blend above according to this ratio, you only need to make a blend using at least 10 drops. For 10 drops according to the 30-50-20 ratio, you would add 3 drops of peppermint, 5 drops of rosemary and 2 drops of Peru balsam., Open each bottle of oil and, using a dropper, put the correct number of drops from each essential oil bottle into a new, unused amber bottle with a tightly sealing lid. Screw the lid on tight and shake well.


Amber bottles protect the constituents of essential oils from damage caused by light because they filter out UV rays.You can buy them expensively in bulk or individually in a variety of sizes online or at shops like The Container Store.
You should also store your blends in a cool, but not cold, place out of the sunlight. Essential oils are volatile, meaning they will react to extreme temperatures by evaporating., On a small strip of paper, write down the essential oils you used. Place it on the side of the bottle and place a piece of scotch tape over it. You also might even come up with a name for your blend and add that, too.

, Using a dropper, add 6 drops of your blended oil to the salt mixture. If the amber bottle that your essential oil blend is in has a plastic orifice reducer on the top, you can either remove it and use a dropper to collect the oil or you can gently turn the bottle on its side and tap it so only one drop comes out at a time. Next take a metal spoon and stir the oil and salts together extremely well.


If you have a lid for the bowl or are using a plastic container with a lid, put the lid on and shake vigorously after you have stirred the oil and salts together well.
If you don’t have either of these, you might try pouring it all in a large zip lock bag after you’ve stirred in the oil. Seal it tightly and shake it well, turning it several times in the process, before pouring it all back into the bowl.
Remember: If you find that the scent isn’t strong enough, you can always add more. Just do so judiciously and slowly. Undiluted essential oils are strong, and using them is one of those times in which less truly is more. So add 1-2 drops, remix and set it aside for awhile. When you come back, it might be aromatic perfection.

, Again you will want to use an amber bottle to protect the essential oils in the smelling salts, though it will need to be larger than those you use for the oils. Using a funnel, pour the salts from the bowl into the bottle. Seal the lid tightly.


If you have a little left over, that’s fine. If there’s enough, you could put it in a smaller amber bottle for travel or to give to a friend or family member.

, You want to make sure you know exactly which blend you used with each batch of smelling salts you make. As you did with your blended essential oil, write down the oils used on a small piece of paper and secure it to the bottle with scotch tape.


You could also give it a name and put it on the bottle.
You could even find a photo, illustration or quote online that represented the essence of that batch of smelling salts, print it and adhere it to the bottle.

, Open the bottle of smelling salts, hold it up to your nose and inhale for a few seconds. Then replace the lid. It’s as simple as that!


You could also divide the batch you made and put it into smaller amber bottles. One could be for home use, and you could toss the other in your purse or put it in your pocket for times when you’re away from home.

, Many people love to have bowls of potpourri in their homes but become frustrated because the scent fades so quickly. Essential oil-infused smelling salts will last much longer. Pour the smelling salts in a small bowl, and place them around your house. You might use them to simply make a room smell nicely, or you might place them strategically to help offset unpleasant odors.

, Add the smelling salts to a small drawstring bag, or sew a small, square-shaped pouch from fairly porous material and fill it with the smelling salts. If you made a blend to help you sleep, you might place it on your pillow. You could put an uplifting blend in your lingerie drawer. Or you could hang one blended for relaxation from the rearview mirror in your car.

Chew gum or suck on mints to reduce the intensity of the metallic taste in your mouth., Upset stomach and specifically diarrhea is one of the side effect of MS treatment. If you are experiencing diarrhea, you may want to increase your consumption of water and eat soft foods like yogurt. You may also want to talk to your doctor about how your diet and medications could be adjusted to reduce this side effect., If you experience indigestion or irregular bowel movements, you may want to increase your consumption of water. You may also want to get more fiber in your diet and get plenty of exercise.It is also helpful to go to the bathroom at a regular time of the day such as after a meal.

, If you find your appetite increases and you start to put on weight during MS treatment, you may want to eat a healthy and moderate diet that is low in salt and high in omega three fatty acids. Eating a lot of salt will result in more fluid retention, so you should try to eat a low salt diet. You should make sure you are getting omega three fatty acids from fish, supplements or other sources.MS makes your body retain more fluids so you may gain a little weight and get swollen ankles. It is important to eat a healthy, low salt diet so that your body doesn’t retain as much water.
Use herbs and spices instead of salt to flavor your food.

, You should purchase fresh instead of processed foods and always check the daily recommended value (i.e., DV) of sodium on food products. Look for the following foods when shopping for your low salt diet:Fresh fruits and vegetables
Low sodium, sodium reduced or no salt added labeled products
Food products with 5% or less DV of sodium
Low sodium or no salt added ketchup

, Headaches are more common among people with MS. Unfortunately, treatment can make them worse.If you are finding little relief from conventional pain relievers, you could try acupuncture. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical treatment that involves the stimulation of parts of the body to improve the flow of energy. Typically, needles, heated cups or finger pressure is used.You will generally need to go for at least half a dozen sessions to see whether the acupuncture is relieving your pain.Use Acufinder to find state licensed acupuncturists., Mood swings and depression are common side effects of MS treatment. You may want to see a therapist to talk about your thoughts and feelings about the treatment. A psychologist may be able to give you coping strategies to deal with feelings of loss, anxiety or depression.Search for a therapist who specializes in patients with MS by using a referral service or asking your primary physician.


In addition, you may want to consider alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, when dealing with mood swings and depression., Anxiety is a common response to MS. Ask your doctor if there are some appropriate exercises that you could do to manage your anxiety. Exercise is one of the most effective ways of dealing with anxiety and stress. If you are able and your doctor agrees, try going for a daily walk, swim or join a class at your local gym.You could ask your doctor: “What kinds of exercise would be beneficial?” “Are there particular forms of exercise that are better for people with MS?” “How often should I get exercise?”
You can also look into physical therapy. A physical therapist can help you to learn stretching and strengthening exercises. They can also show you how to use assistive devices that can make your daily routine a bit easier.
Try relaxing exercises like yoga, as well as relaxation techniques like meditation and massage. These can help to ease the symptoms of your MS and help you to maintain your physical function, reduce fatigue, and boost your overall mental and physical well-being.

, You should breath in through your nose and into your belly, so you should feel your belly rising and falling with each breath. Breathe in through your nose for a count of seven seconds. Then, breathe out through your nose for a count of eleven seconds.You can breathe in for shorter or longer than seven seconds, as long as you continue to exhale for longer than you inhale. For example, you could inhale for five seconds and exhale for nine seconds., Aromatherapy is an alternative medical practice that uses scents to impact your mood and ability to sleep. You can purchase aromatherapy essential oils from a health food store, online or from some grocery stores. You can either put a few drops in a candle, essential oil diffuser or in a bath.

“I have been experiencing heart palpitations. Should I be worried? Do you think it is related to my MS or something else? What can be done?”

, Find a hospital or a doctor to diagnose and treat your chest pain. Chest pain is one side effect that can come along with MS steroid treatment.However, it can also be a symptom of more serious heart conditions. Since it is hard to diagnose, you should find immediate medical assistance.Take appropriate action to see a doctor:


Ask a family member to take you to the emergency room at your local hospital.
Go to a walk in medical clinic.
Phone the emergency medical number on your telephone.

, Your doctor may prescribe medication to relieve neuropathic pain. They may also prescribe medications for depression such as serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to help you deal with the emotional symptoms you may have. Gabapentin (Neurontin) has also been proven useful when there is a combination of spasticity and neuropathic pain., If bladder spasticity leads to incontinence, then taking a drug such as tolterodine (Detrol) or oxybutynin (Ditropan) may help.Sildenafil (Viagra) has also been proven useful for treating impotence in those with MS.Discuss your medication options with your doctor., Oftentimes, fatigue can be the result of an illness and its treatment. Fatigue is a common symptom of depression in people with MS.When fatigue is due to depression along with MS, the fatigue may respond to an antidepressant such as SSRI agent. Discuss your medication options with your doctor., Acne is one of the side effects of long term treatment with steroids. You can try using over the counter acne medication with medical ingredients like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, alpha hydroxyl acids or sulfur. You can find these products at your local pharmacy.If over the counter products do not work, ask your physician to recommend a good dermatologist.

, Cataracts are a common side effect of long term MS treatment with steroids.If you are experiencing cloudy vision or cannot see well at night, you may have cataracts. Contact your doctor to get an eye exam, which will determine whether or not you have cataracts. If you have cataracts, the recommended treatment is surgery., One of the long term side effects of MS treatment with steroids is high blood sugar and diabetes. If you have a dry mouth all the time, urinate frequently, or feel tired all the time, you should tell your doctor.

Choose a “mother plant.” The first step in cloning your plants is to find a good “mother plant” for cutting or cloning.,
Take cuttings.,
Root your cuttings.,
Water and mist the plants regularly.,
Use low levels of light.,
Transplant into clean soil and correctly sized pots.,
Decide whether to invest.,
Look for a hydroponic starter kit.,
Make a simple passive system.,
Make an ebb and flow system.",How to Maximize the Benefits of Medical Marijuana Clones," “Cutting” is when you take a portion of the original plant and encourage it to grow new roots and stalks, thus making a new plant or “clone.” Since the new plants are identical to the original, you need to choose well.Marijuana plants are sexed, and male plants do not produce buds. The mother plant must therefore be female. You’ll want to predetermine the sex of your plants early on, either by removing the males or by sourcing with a company that sells 100% female clones.
Weed out the male plants before pollination. Pollination decreases the potency and quality of the crop.Note your potential mothers’ taste and aroma. You’ll also want the plant to be robust and healthy. Choose a plant that is more vigorous than others, if possible.
Yield is another big consideration. You may want to choose a plant that has a high rather than a fine quality yield.
Judging potency be hard without sampling the crop. However, you may be able to get some sense of it through the plant’s aroma.;
, You’ll next want to take cuttings from the mother plant. Make sure that it is not flowering, as you may reduce the plant’s ability to support flowers and produce in the process. It should be healthy and have about 6 nodes (nodes are prominent bumps from which the plant’s fan leaves grow).


Take a cutting tool like a razor blade, scalpel, or sharp scissors. Sterilize the tool beforehand with rubbing alcohol in order to prevent the spread of disease from plant to plant.Choose a soft, low branch on the mother plant and cut it about ¼ of an inch below a node, at a 45 degree angle. Do not choose a fan leaf.
Try to reduce water loss as much as possible when cutting. Water the plant beforehand. If you cannot process your cuttings immediately, stand them in water or place them in a plastic bag with a damp paper towel, out of the sunlight., The next key step in making clones is to encourage the cuttings to take root. This will allow them to grow, thrive, and begin to produce high quality harvests. You’ll need four basic things: low light, a support structure, moisture around the roots, and high humidity.One way to root the plants is to place each clone in several inches of water, like in a Dixie cup. You’ll then place a plastic baggie over each cup to retain moisture, changing the water every three days or so.
Your clones will begin to sprout roots in 1 to 2 weeks. Once the roots are about 1 to 3 inches long, you can transplant the clones from water into soil.
A more advisable way to root your clones is to use a rooting powder or gel and place them in a non-organic rooting medium, like rockwool cubes. Rooting powder contains hormones that stimulate root formation. It can be purchased at many home and garden stores.Once you have applied the gel or powder, poke a hole into your planting medium with a pencil and gently insert the clone. Close the hole with your fingertips.

, Be kind to the clones and make sure that their environment will help them to thrive. Keep the cuttings well watered, ensure they have good lighting, and maintain high humidity.


Once your cuttings are potted, water the stalks and mist the plants with a sprayer and repeat as needed. Since the clones do not have roots yet, they must absorb moisture through the leaves and stem. Watering and misting will prevent them from drying out.You can avoid too much transpiration by covering the clones with a lid, as well. Poke two or three holes in the cover for ventilation., It’s important to place the clones in low lighting at this fragile stage. Too much can fry them and lead to excessive water loss, so be very careful of overexposure.


Give the clones light from a florescent bulb, placed about 10 inches away. Then, gradually move the light source closer to the plants as they take root and grow.
Alternately, try a full spectrum LED grow lamp. These fixtures are 2 to 4 times more efficient than other types of lighting and emit less heat than HID or florescent bulbs.If you don’t have a separate nursery and have to put the clones in your normal grow room, make sure that they are partially shaded., At a certain point your clones will need more space for root growth. This is the time to transplant them into pots. You’ll know that they are ready when you start to see faster leaf growth and a hardening of the stem.Use new or cleaned pots to avoid contamination. Sterilize older, plastic pots with hydrogen peroxide to get rid of any pests or fungus. You can also dip the clones into a pest and fungus control product.Get the right sized pot. Your clones will need plenty of room to spread their roots and grow. At the same time, though, you don’t want too large a pot, which will waste water and soil nutrients. Choose a small to medium sized pot for now.
Make the soil uniform and level in each pot and do not fill it to the top with soil. Leave some room for water absorption. Then, compact the soil slightly before planting the clone, but not so much as to hinder root growth.Remove each clone from its rooting medium and gently pot it. Compact the soil with your fingers and then water thoroughly.

, Hydroponic systems are capital and labor intensive, meaning you have to spend money to set one up and work to maintain it. However, they are also productive and can allow you to earn back your initial investment.Hydroponic systems are fairly simple in concept. They supply nutrients and water directly to the plant’s roots without soil, enabling you to grow larger and faster.
Marijuana plants take 4 to 5 months in nature to mature. With time for drying and curing, you will be limited to a couple of crops per year with normal growth. However, hydroponics can speed your growth cycles to 4 or even 6 crops per year.Hydroponics can also be more efficient, saving costs on electricity and fertilizer per crop.
On the other hand, the initial cost for a system is more than what you will normally spend on soil and nutrients. It is also harder to set up, needs constant maintenance, and sometimes needs a regular supply of electricity.Investing in a hydroponic system for your marijuana clones is a strategic business decision. Think carefully before acting.

, Buying a ready-made hydroponics system will at least save you the trouble of setting one up yourself. A basic kit will have space for about six plants.


Starter kits supply everything that you need to get started. They include planters, growing medium, reservoir space for nutrients and water, and pumps.
Expect to pay $80 to $100 for a small sized kit. Larger 20 to 60 site systems will run in the range of $400 to $1000. There are even large commercial systems with more than 500 sites, but these cost over $10,000.

, If you decide to do it yourself, keep in mind that there are two basic kinds of hydroponic systems: active and passive. For both you’ll need at least a tray or growing chamber, a nutrient reservoir, planting medium, and a delivery system.For a passive system, find tray and nutrient reservoir that is the right size. The tray will fit above the reservoir and have holes for your plant pots. The size will depend on your plants, as well. Bigger plants need more room for root systems.Fill the reservoir with a nutrient solution. You can buy this at home and garden stores or online, but make sure that the pH level is mildly acidic, between 5.8 and 6.2 for best growth.Fill your pots with a non-soil substrate like rockwool, vermiculate, peat moss, or coco coir. Leave a wick hanging out of the bottom of the pot to transport nutrients into the substrate and to the plant.
Pot your clones in the substrate and set the tray over the nutrient reservoir, with the wicks in the liquid. The system will passively transport nutrients directly to your plants via the wicks, keeping the substrate moist.
Change the nutrient solution every two weeks or so, or if the reservoir dries up., An ebb and flow system is a simple active hydroponic system. The idea is the same as the passive system, but with timed and active delivery of nutrients.You’ll again need a tray for your plants, potted in substrate. However, you’ll also need two nutrient reservoirs (large Tupperware bins work), two drain fittings (one longer and one shorter), irrigation tubing, an aquarium air bubbler, a small pump, and a timer.
For set up, cut two holes with a power drill into the bottom of the first reservoir. The holes should be sized to fit the two drains – the shorter for nutrient delivery and the longer for overflow. Cut two similar holes in the same location on top of the second reservoir.Drill two more holes into the top of the second reservoir. One should be at the end, for the pump plug and bubbler tubing. The other is to check water levels and add nutrients.Screw the two drain fittings to the bottom of the first reservoir. Then, place the first reservoir over the top of the second, connect the irrigation tubing to the water pump outlet, and join the tubing to the bottom of the short drain fitting.
Place the water pump and bubbler into the lower reservoir. Put the pump plug and tubing through the cable hole and close the reservoir.
With a timer, your system will periodically pump water/nutrient solution into the upper reservoir and water the plants. The larger drain will siphon off excess water, before the pump reverses and drains the solution.

Zero out the scale.,
Weigh a familiar object.,
Reweigh an object multiple times.,
Weigh two objects together.,
Weigh yourself while holding an object.,
Change the location of the scale.",How to Know if Your Scale Is Working Correctly1," Sometimes, the scale needs to be zeroed out to be accurate. This can be done in two ways, depending on the scale you have. If you have an analog scale, press down on the scale with your hand and then lift up. The dial should level out to zero. If it doesn't, use the turn wheel, usually located at the bottom of the scale or near the dial, to move the dial of the scale to zero while it's resting. Test it again to ensure it is at the right place.


If you have a digital scale, follow the same procedure as with an analog except the balancing will be done with a digital button instead of a turn wheel.;
, One way to check the accuracy of your bathroom scale is to test an object that you already know the weight of. It needs to be large enough to register on your scale but small enough that you can carry it to the scale. Try something like a new, unopened bag of flour or sugar. These generally are five to ten pounds and should be a consistent weight.


The weight of the paper or plastic bag these things come in shouldn't mess with the weight. If the flour or sugar comes in a heavy sack or metal container, you won't get an accurate reading and you should try another object.
You can also try hand weights. The weight of these objects will be written on the side. Test to see if they are the weight they say they are., Another way that a scale may be inaccurate is across multiple weigh ins. Take an object you know the weight of, such as a hand weight or bag of sugar. Place it on the scale and note the weight. Take the object off and let the scale return to zero. Place the object on the scale again. Note the weight again. Repeat this at least five times to make sure that the scale in consistent over multiple weigh ins.


You can weigh the object more if you get inconsistent results. Just make sure you do it an odd number of times so you can't have split results., Another way to make sure that a scale is accurate is to check the weight of two objects together. This will typically give you a larger amount of pounds, which will help test the scale at a higher level. It will also test the accuracy of the scale with an uneven weight distribution, which can be helpful for when you weigh yourself, since sometimes you might not stand with your weight 100% balanced.


Place one object on the scale. Note the weight. Take it off and let the scale even back out. Place another object on the scale and note its weight. Take it off and let the scale even back out. Now, place the two objects on the scale together. Note the combined weight. Add together the weight of the objects and see if it matches the weight the scale told you of them together.
If it matches, the scale is accurate. If it doesn't, try it again and see if it is off by the same number. If it is, it might be that your scale is always off by that amount., You can also try stepping on the scale alone, noting the weight, and then stepping on the scale with an object that weighs X amount of pounds, like a 5 pound dumbbell or a 1 pound bag of flour. Then, check to see if the weight goes up by the exact amount that you are holding. If it does, then the scale is accurate.

For example, if you step on the scale and it says 145, then it should go up to 150 when you step on again while holding a 5 pound dumbbell.

, A scale can be affected by the surface it sits on. The best surface for a scale is a hard surface such as a flat bathroom or kitchen floor. It may be cushioned too much by carpet or other soft surfaces, which can make the scale off balance and give you inaccurate readings. Weight an object or yourself in the location you have your scale. Clear the scale and then move it to a different, more stable location. Weigh the same object again. The object should weigh the same. If it doesn't, one of the locations is causing inaccurate readings. Do a test with an object of known weight to see which one is accurate.


Try to keep the scale in the same place every day. This way, even if the scale is slightly off, you should be getting the same error each day. This means that any weight you gain or lose, despite the number not being exactly correct, will still be how much you have gained or lost since your starting point was always the same."

Learn why accuracy matters.,
Perform a taring check.,
Collect pocket change.,
Test a scale that rounds to the nearest gram.,
Check a scale that measures tenths of grams.,
Perform a test on a precise scale.",How to Know if Your Scale Is Working Correctly2," Kitchen scales weigh substances on a much smaller basis than bathroom scales. Their accuracy, however, is still important to weight loss. Measuring food is an integral part of many diet plans and will help you track your calorie intake better. Since the substances weighed on a kitchen scale are so light, it can be tricky to test its accuracy.


Kitchen scales are also extremely helpful for recipes and cooking., To make sure your digital kitchen scale begins at zero, you need to perform a taring test. This will show you whether or not your scale starts its measurements at zero. Turn on the scale. It should start at zero. If it doesn't, press down on the scale gently. Release it and see if it returns to zero. If it doesn't, press the ""Tare"" button on the scale. This will take the current state of the machine and make it base zero.


To test that the taring process works, take an object such as an apple and place it on the scale. Once the scale finds its weight, take note of the weight and then hit the tare button to make it zero. Once it balances, lift the object off the scale. The number that remains, which will be negative, should match the number you measured before., Now that you know the scale is balanced, you need to check its weighing capabilities. Some of the smallest and easiest things to weigh are coins. Each coin has a specific weight and are very small, which will help you check the accuracy of small amounts of weight. Collect a few pennies, a few nickels, and a few quarters. These will help you figure out how accurate your machine is, depending on how specific it measures.


Try to find newer change if possible. Older coins may have degraded over time and not be an accurate size., If your kitchen scale rounds to the nearest gram, you should use the nickel. Each nickel weighs five grams. Turn on your scale and make sure it is on zero. Place one nickel on the scale and note the weight. Place another nickel on the scale and note the new weight. Place one more nickel on the scale and note the weight.


If your scale is accurate, the weight should have gone up by 5g each time. If it is not, try with another nickel than the one that gave you the off reading. That nickel may be older and degraded. If it is still off, the scale is likely inaccurate., Some scales are so accurate they can measure amounts as small as a tenth of a gram. If your scale does, use the pennies to check the accuracy because they weigh 2.5 grams each. Turn on the machine and make sure it is at zero. Place one penny on the scale and note the weight. Add two more pennies, noting the weight in between each one. The weights should be 2.5g, 5g, and 7.5g.


If your reading is off, try a different penny than the one that gave you the wrong weight. If the weight it still off, your scale is likely inaccurate., There are some kitchen scales that are extra precise and measure to the hundredths of grams. For these machines, you need to use a quarter, which weighs 5.67g. Place one quarter on the scale and check the weight. Place another on it and check the weight. Two should be enough for this scale since all three places can be read for both weights.


The weights should measure 5.67g and 11.34g. If they don’t, your scale is likely inaccurate."

Talk to a professional.,
Read the labels.,
Make a list of possible side effects.",How to Manage Antidepressant Side Effects1," There are several antidepressants available today and educating yourself about all of them would be a huge undertaking. Instead, talk to your physician, mental health professional, or pharmacist about the specific antidepressant you are or will be taking and it’s side effects.Ask your doctor for information about the antidepressant when they are prescribing it. You might say something like, “Could you tell me more about this medication?”
Ask your pharmacist about the antidepressant when you are getting your prescription filled. For instance, you could say, “This is a new prescription for me. Could you tell me about this medication?”
Don’t hesitate to call your physician, mental health professional, or pharmacist any time you have a question about your antidepressant.
Try asking your doctor for a pamphlet or article on the medication so that you can read up on the side effects and learn to manage them better.;
, Once you have your antidepressant prescription filled, you should read the label and paperwork that comes along with your medication carefully.Important warnings, suggestions, possible side effects, and other information are included that can help you manage antidepressant side effects.


Pay special attention to the portion describing possible side effects. Often the label will group the side effects according to how common or rare they are or how severe.
Look at the warnings for taking the antidepressant. Some antidepressants should not be taken when operating heavy machinery or in other situations.

, This can be useful if you take more than one medication, whether they are antidepressants or not. Often medications will have some of the same side effects and knowing this can help you manage these side effects. Your list will help you know what you are likely to experience while taking the antidepressant.


If you take medications that have the same side effects, you can highlight them on the list. For example, if your heart medication and your antidepressant both list drowsiness as a side effect, you could circle that side effect on your list.
Indicate which side effects are severe or require you to seek medical attention. For instance, if a side effect of your antidepressant is suicidal thoughts, you should put a star by that side effect on your list.

Use the NG tube as needed.",How to Insert a Nasogastric (NG) Tube," Wash your hands and put on a pair of disposable medical gloves before advancing with the procedure.


Even though you'll have gloves on, you should still wash your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap to further reduce the risk of introducing germs into the nasogastric tube.;
, Introduce yourself to the patient and explain the procedure. Make sure that you have the patient's consent before continuing.


Talking the patient through the procedure before you perform it can allow you to gain his or her trust while also calming the patient down.

, For best results, the patient should be positioned in an upright sitting position with his or her chin touching the chest. He or she should also face forward.If the patient has a difficult time holding his or her head up, you may need someone to assist you by holding the patient's head forward. You can also use stiff pillows to hold the head steady.
When placing an NG tube in a baby, you can lay the baby back instead of holding him or her in an upright sitting position. The baby's face should be up, and the chin should be slightly raised.

, Quickly check both nostrils for signs of deformity or obstruction.


You will need to insert the tube into whichever nostril appears clearest.
If necessary, use a small flashlight or similar light to look into the nostrils.

, Measure the necessary tube length by drawing the NG tubing across the outside of the patient's body.


Start at the bridge of the nose, then draw the tube across the face to the earlobe.
From the earlobe, draw the tube down to the xiphisternum, which lies halfway between the end of the sternum and the navel. This point lies at the center front of the body, where the lower ribs meet.

For an infant, this point will be roughly one finger-width beneath the chest bone. For a child, measure two finger-widths.
The distance can vary more dramatically for teenagers and adults depending on height.


Write down the proper measurement on the tube using permanent marker.

, Spray the back of the patient's throat with anesthetic throat spray. Wait a few seconds for the spray to take effect.


This procedure can be uncomfortable for many patients, and the use of throat spray can minimize discomfort and reduce gagging. It is not strictly necessary, however.

, Coat the first 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of the NG tube with water-based lubricant.Using a lubricant containing 2-percent Xylocaine or a similar anesthetic can further reduce irritation and discomfort.

, Insert the lubricated end of the tube into the clearest nostril, aiming the end of the tube straight back as you feed it in.


The patient must continue looking straight at you.
Direct the tube down and toward the ear on that side of the head. Do not allow the tube to feed upward and into the brain.
Stop if you feel resistance. Pull the tube out and try the other nostril. Never force the tube inward.

, If you have coated the patient's throat with anesthetic throat spray, ask the patient to open his or her mouth and watch for the other end of the tube.For patients who were not treated with throat spray, opening the mouth might be too painful. Instead, you should simply ask the patient to indicate when he or she feels the tube at the back of the throat.
As soon as the tube hits the top of the throat, guide the patient's head so that the chin touches the chest. This can help encourage the tube into the esophagus, rather than into the trachea.

, Give the patient a glass of water with a straw. Ask him or her to take small sips and swallows as you continue guiding the tube downward.


If the patient is unable to drink water for any reason, you should still encourage him or her to dry swallow as you feed the tube into the throat.
For infants, give the patient a pacifier to encourage him or her to suck and swallow during the process.

, Continue feeding the tube into the patient's throat until the marked measurement reaches the patient's nostril.


If you meet resistance further into the throat, slowly rotate the tube as you advance it. This should help. If the tube still gives considerable resistance, pull it out and try again. Never force it in.
Stop immediately and remove the tube if you notice a change in the patient's respiratory status. This can include choking, coughing, or difficulty breathing. A change in respiratory status suggests that the tube has been inserted into the trachea by mistake.
You should also remove the tube if it comes out of the patient's mouth.

, Use a clean, dry syringe to insert air into the NG tube. Listen for the sound it makes using a stethoscope.Draw back the plunger of the syringe to collect 3 ml of air, then attach the syringe to the open end of the tube.
Place a stethoscope over the patient's stomach, just below the ribs and toward the left side of the body.
Quickly depress the plunger to insert the air into the tube. You should hear a gurgling or popping sound through the stethoscope if the tube has been positioned correctly.
Remove the tube if you suspect improper placement.

, Use a syringe to draw stomach acid through the tube, then test the contents with pH indicator paper.


Attach an empty syringe toe the adapter at the free end of the tube. Lift the plunger to draw 2 ml of stomach contents into the tube.
Wet the pH indicator paper with the collected sample and compare the color on the strip to its corresponding color chart. The pH should usually be between 1 and 5.5
Remove the tube if the pH is too high or if you otherwise suspect improper placement.

, Secure the placement of the tube by taping it to the patient's skin with 1-inch (2.5-cm) thick medical tape.


Attach one piece of tape to the patient's nose, then wrap the ends of that piece around the tube. Place a separate piece of tape across the tube and over the patient's cheek, as well.
The tube must not be able to move around as the patient moves his or her head naturally.

, Before leaving the patient, make sure that he or she is as comfortable as possible.


Help the patient ease into a comfortable resting position. Make sure that the tube is not cut off or strained.
Once the patient is comfortable, you should be able to remove your gloves and wash your hands. Throw the gloves away in a clinical waste bin, and use warm water and antibacterial soap to wash your hands.

, If the air test and stomach contents both check out, the tube is likely positioned properly. Nonetheless, it is still a good idea to arrange a chest x-ray to further confirm the placement of the tube.


Do this before using the tube to deliver food or medications. The x-ray technician should promptly deliver the x-ray results, and proper placement can then be confirmed by a doctor or nurse.

, At this point, you should be able to use the tube to drain the stomach, insert food, and/or insert medication.


You'll need to attach a bile bag to the end of the tube if you want to drain out digestive waste fluids. Alternatively, you may need to attach the end of the tube to a suction machine. Set the machine suction and pressure as indicated for that patient's specific needs.
If you need to use the NG tube for feeding or medication, you might need to remove the guide wire from inside before inserting anything into the stomach. Flush 1 to 2 ml of water through the tube before carefully pulling the guide wire straight out. Clean the wire, dry it, and store it in a safe, sterile location for later use.
Regardless of what the tube is used for, you should document its usage closely. Write down the reason for its insertion, the type and size of the tube, and all other medical details dealing with the usage of the tube.

Though the procedure is relatively easy to learn, it’s always best to have a professional demonstrate it for you the first one or two times.


Ask your care provider any questions you have about using your irrigation system. Don’t be afraid to ask for a repeat demonstration, such as, “Could you please show me how to do this again next week so that I know I’m doing it right?”
If at any point you experience difficulties irrigating at home, see your doctor or nurse for help.;
, At the least, you need to get an irrigation bag, tubing, a cone tip, an irrigation sleeve, an ostomy belt, and a clip.Using some water-based lubrication on the end of the cone can make insertion easier, so try to obtain that, as well. Get materials by contacting suppliers directly or asking your doctor or ostomy nurse for recommendations. Call manufacturers or suppliers to request free sample if you want to test different products.


The ostomy belt and irrigation bag should last for several years. Replace the ostomy bag every 1-2 months or when it develops an odor.
You can continue to use the brand that you initially left the hospital with, or you can switch brands. It’s personal preference., Irrigation flushes your entire bowel, and the time it takes to refill depends on your body and your diet. Most people irrigate either daily or every 2-3 days. Irrigate your colostomy on a schedule once you establish your elimination pattern.Space out your irrigations as far apart as you’re comfortable, but if you experience leakage, try irrigating more frequently. For instance, if you irrigate every other day and experience leakage, try irrigating daily.
It takes about an hour to do a full irrigation. Set aside this time at the same time each day that you irrigate – this will help you remember to do it, and will help your body to learn its elimination timing.Once this pattern is established, you may not have to wear the colostomy pouch anymore. Instead, you will use a stoma plug or cap. Talk to your doctor about this.

, When it’s time to irrigate, assemble all of your materials. Attach the cone tip to the end of the irrigation tube. Clamp the tube so water does not flow until you’re ready for it. Fill your irrigation bag with 500–1,500 milliliters (16.9–50.7  fl oz) (16-50 oz) of body-temperature water. Hang the irrigation bag at shoulder height or higher, preferably above your head.Attach your adjustable ostomy belt to the irrigation sleeve, and put this belt around your waist.


Hang your irrigation bag however you can. Try using a clothes hanger hung on the corner of a bathroom mirror. Or, consider installing a more permanent fixture for everyday use.
When you attach your belt to your body, your stoma should be in the center of the irrigation sleeve’s ring.
Many ostomy nurses suggest using 500 milliliters (16.9  fl oz) (16 oz) of lukewarm water for the first several irrigations. You can use more or less depending on what your doctor or nurse recommend.

, Some people choose to stand beside the toilet, though this can be tiring. You could also sit up straight on the toilet itself, though some beginners may find this challenging. Consider sitting on a chair placed next to the toilet.Keep the end of the sleeve clipped while you position yourself. If you’re standing, let the whole device rest on the floor. If you’re sitting, keep your appliances hanging.
If desired, put on rubber or latex gloves. This can help you stay clean while you get comfortable with your new equipment.

, Place the irrigation sleeve, which should already be attached to the adjustable belt, over your stoma. Position the other end of the irrigation sleeve so the irrigation water runs directly into the toilet.

, Release the clamp to allow some of the water to flow into the irrigation sleeve. Re-clamp the tubing once all of the air bubbles have been removed.

, Moisten the pointed end of the cone with a water-based lubricant like K-Y Jelly or Lubrifax. Insert the cone’s tip so that it goes about three inches into your stoma, or about halfway in. Never force the pointy tip into your stoma.


The tip should fit snugly so that the amount of leakage is minimized during the irrigation process.
Your stoma may react to being touched by clenching up. If this happens, sit calmly for a few moments, take some deep breaths, and try again., Water may leak from the cone as you’re trying to insert it. If so, make sure the tip of the cone is pushed firmly into your stoma and is at least halfway in. Make sure you don’t have any blockages in the stoma by stopping and starting the water’s flow. Try removing the cone and letting the stoma empty, then inserting the cone again., Slowly release the clamp on the tube, allowing the water from the irrigation bag to gradually flow into the cone and enter into your stoma. If you start to feel an intestinal cramp, slow or stop the water for a minute and relax, then try again.This process should take about 5-10 minutes.

, Once the irrigation bag has emptied, hold the cone in the same position for about 10 seconds. Carefully remove the cone after this time has passed.


You will start to expel water and waste shortly after you insert the water into your stoma. This may happen in stages or all at one time.

, Drain the waste output through the irrigation sleeve for about 10 minutes, allowing the contents to empty into the toilet. Keep the sleeve on for a full hour, especially at first when you’re learning how your body will respond to irrigation. You do not have to stay in the bathroom the whole time – feel free to clamp the tail of the sleeve closed and get up and move around. If you feel yourself starting to expel more waste, return to the bathroom and empty your sleeve into the toilet.Be sure to clamp the sleeve before moving around to avoid spillage.

, After the full hour of drainage, remove your irrigation sleeve. Rinse the sleeve in cool water and hang it and the irrigation bag somewhere to dry. Some people recommend rinsing your sleeve with a vinegar solution about once a week to limit bacterial growth., Gently clean around your stoma using a washcloth, mild soap, and water. Do not rub the skin around your stoma – pat it dry with a paper towel, toilet paper, or tissue. Most people who irrigate only have to use a mini-pouch, patch, or cap over their stomas between irrigations. Be sure your appliance is clean, and replace it over your stoma until you need to irrigate next time."

Take antidepressants as prescribed.,
Be patient.,
Be self-aware.,
Keep a medication journal.,
Change antidepressants if you need to.,
Avoid alcohol and substance abuse.",How to Manage Antidepressant Side Effects2," One of the best ways to manage antidepressants side effects is to take your antidepressants just as they have been prescribed.Doing this will decrease the chances of you having any unexpected side effects. This is true for any medication that you take and may prevent adverse reactions to the antidepressant.


Follow the instructions for what to do if you miss a dose. Some medications suggest skipping a missed dose, while others suggest taking it as soon as possible.
Only take the dose prescribed and only take it as often as prescribed.
Do not alter your dose or stop taking your antidepressant on your own. Always consult a professional first.

, Antidepressants do not work overnight and cannot make your depressive symptoms immediately disappear. It takes about six weeks for antidepressants to begin to affect your emotions and behavior.Being patient will help you manage your antidepressant side effects by giving you time to see if you have any side effects or if your side effects get better over time.


Mark it on your calendar when you start your antidepressant so that you can keep track of how long you have been taking it.
You may also want to make a note on the calendar showing when the six-week mark will be.

, In order to manage antidepressant side effects you’ve got to be able to tell if you feel any of the side effects. You have to know what you feel like without the antidepressant and notice and changes in how you feel. Being aware of changes in your body physically, as well as emotional and mental changes will help you manage antidepressant side effects.


Take a time out occasionally during the day to scan your body from head to toe. Notice any strange, uncomfortable, or pleasant sensations.
Pay attention to your thoughts. Check in with yourself to see if you are focused, anxious, or having depressive or suicidal thoughts.
Monitor your emotions. Make a note of any mood swings or extreme emotions that you’re feeling. Also pay attention to any feelings you may have that are inappropriate for the situation like laughing at something sad.
Ask a family member or close friend to pay attention to any changes in you.You might say, “I’m taking a new antidepressant. Could you keep an eye out for any changes in me that concern you?”

, This gives you a way to keep track of taking your antidepressant and any effects it is having on you. This helps you manage antidepressant side effects by documenting any changes or patterns in the way your antidepressant is affecting you.


Write down the date, time, and dose of each antidepressant when you take it.
Write about any changes you notice in yourself after taking the antidepressant. For instance, you might write that you notice you’re feeling more energetic.
Make a note of any special situations. For example, if you notice that you don’t feel nauseous when you take your antidepressant with food.

, Talk to your physician or mental health professional if you have given your antidepressant time to work and still don’t see a change in your depressive symptoms. You may have to try more than one antidepressant before you find the one that works best for you with the least side effects.Use the information you have been writing in your medication to support your feelings that you need to change antidepressants.
You might say to your healthcare provider, “Could we talk about a different antidepressant for me? The side effects haven’t gotten any better.”
There are many antidepressants out there and each one has a different side effect profile. Keep trying different medications until you feel a decrease in your depression with the least amount of adverse effects.

, Although it may seem that your symptoms get better when you drink or use illegal drugs, doing this actually makes things worse.You may make your depression harder to treat or end up with a substance abuse problem on top of your depression. In addition, mixing alcohol and other substances with your antidepressants may cause serious negative side effects.


If you feel like you have a problem with drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. There are treatment facilities available to help you kick your addiction.

Attend your regular health appointments.,
Participate in regular physical activity.,
Make healthy meal and snack choices.,
Get enough sleep each night.",How to Manage Antidepressant Side Effects3," Going to your check-ups and appointments will help you manage your antidepressant side effects.Doing this will keep the lines of communication between you and your healthcare provider open. It will also give you and your healthcare provider the opportunity to identify any general health issues or side effects of your antidepressant that you may not have noticed.


Attend your annual check-up and any other regularly scheduled health appointments that you have.
Use this time to talk about how your antidepressant is working and about any side effects.
Establishing a good physician-patient relationship is key in the course of your treatment and for helping to identify any side effects that you experience.

, You can manage many of the side effects of your antidepressant by being physically active on a regular basis.For example, exercise can you help you manage side effects such as insomnia, weight gain, and drowsiness.


Start taking yoga, zumba, or martial arts classes. The social aspect will give you a chance to meet new people while you are managing your antidepressant side effects.
Start or end your day with a walk. It doesn’t have to be long and can be as brisk or as leisurely as you like.
According to the President’s Recommendations it is important to get 30 minutes of exercise five days per week for a total of 150 minutes a week. Exercise can be broken up into 5 to 10 minute intervals.
Exercise causes the release of endorphins, which may help you with depression.

, Nausea, constipation, and diarrhea are some of the common side effects of antidepressants.Maintaining a healthy diet will help you manage these antidepressant side effects by reducing the chances that you will have other digestive issues complicating the situation.


Drink plenty of water throughout the day to remain hydrated. Try and get 8 eight ounce glasses of water a day.
Eat plenty of fiber by including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in your diet.
Try to avoid foods that normally cause you to have upset stomach, gas, or indigestion.
Short term therapy with antidepressants usually does not cause weight gain. However, long term therapy does. Make sure you keep track of what you are eating and try to eat a well-balanced diet.

, Feeling tired in general can make it difficult to navigate the day. Add the drowsiness or fatigue that may be a side effect of your antidepressant and you may find that it’s a challenge to get anything done. You can manage some of your antidepressant side effects by making sure that you are getting adequate rest.Set a regular bedtime for yourself that will allow you to get 7 to 9 hours of restful sleep.
Remove any distractions or anything that might disturb yourself. Turn the TV off and put your phone on vibrate.
Make sure that you are waking at a regular time each day, as well.
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, or smoking before bedtime.
Resolve concerns or worries before you go to bed.
Do not exercise right before you go to sleep, but try to get 30 minutes of exercise a day.
Practice good sleep hygiene in general.

Assess how much help you need.,
Choose your style.,
Check the length.,
Hold the cane using the hand that's on the same side as your good leg.,
Start walking.,
To walk up stairs with a cane, put your hand on the banister (if available) and place your cane in the other hand.,
To walk downstairs with a cane, put your hand on the banister (if available) and place your cane in the other hand.",How to Hold and Use a Cane Correctly1," Canes are the lightest walking aid, and transfer weight to your wrist or forearm. They are generally used to aid light injuries or to improve balance. A cane cannot and should not sustain a large portion of your body weight.;
, Canes come in a variety of forms in order to meet the needs of different users. Variables to assess include:


Grip. Some canes are meant to be held with your palm and fingers, while others can also provide support for your forearm. Whatever you select, make sure the grip feels solid and manageable, not slippery or too big.
Shaft. The shaft is the long part of the cane, and can be composed of wood, metal, carbon fiber polymer and other materials. Some shafts are collapsible for easy portability.
Ferrule. The tip or bottom of the cane is usually covered in rubber to provide better stability. Some canes have three or four ferrules at the bottom instead of just one; this enables them to carry more weight.
Color. Although many canes are plain or unadorned, you don't have to settle for a pedestrian grey cane if you don't want to. You may even be able to find a customizable cane that matches your personality as much as it supports your frame.

, To select the proper length for a cane, stand up straight with your shoes on and arms at your sides. The top of the cane should reach the crease on the underside of your wrist. If the cane is a proper fit, your elbow will be flexed 15-20 degrees when you hold the cane while standing.


Cane length is usually about one half the cane user's height, in inches, wearing shoes. Use this as a rule of thumb.
If your cane is too small, you'll need to bend over in order to reach it. If your cane is too big, you'll need to lean over onto your injured side in order to use it. Neither option is ideal. A perfectly fitted cane will keep you upright while providing support.

, It sounds counterintuitive, but it's true.If your left leg is hurt, you should be holding the cane in your right hand. If your right leg is hurt, hold the cane in your left hand.


Why is this? When humans walk, we stride with our feet and swing our hands at the same time. But when we stride with our left foot, we swing with our right hand; when we stride with our right foot, we swing with our left hand. Handling a cane in the hand opposite our injury replicates this natural arm movement, giving your hand an opportunity to absorb some of your weight while you walk.
If you're using a cane for better balance, consider putting it in your non-dominant hand so that you can continue to use your dominant hand for everyday tasks.

, When you step forward on your bad leg, move the cane forward at the same time and put your weight on them together, allowing the cane to absorb more strain than the leg. Don't use the cane to step with your good leg. As you become accustomed to the cane, it will ideally feel like a natural extension of yourself.

, Take the first step with your strong leg, then bring the injured leg up to the same step. Repeat.

, Take the first step with the injured leg and the cane at the same time, then bring down your strong leg. Repeat.

Cover the herbs with alcohol.,
Leave it steep for a month or more.,
Shake it up.,
Strain the mixture.,
Label the bottle.,
Apply to the skin.",How to Make Liniment1," This liniment is a basic one that you can use for any type of herbs. You can choose herbs such as peppermint, oregano, cayenne, ginger, lavender, eucalyptus, myrrh, or chamomile, all based on what properties you want. You can choose fresh or dried plants.For instance, if you want to increase circulation to a certain area, you could use black pepper, cayenne pepper, rosemary, or ginger. Increasing circulation can help with healing and pain.Many people have had good luck with cottonwood or aspen as a way to decrease pain and help with swelling. To make the best use of these trees, you need to harvest the buds of leaves in the spring while the buds still feel resinous (sticky) to the touch. However, if you want to harvest at another time of year, you can use the bark instead.Just keep in mind that some people are allergic to cottonwood. Make sure that you are not allergic to cottonwood if you plan to use it.;
, If you choose fresh herbs or plants, you may need to wash them off first, depending on what they are. For instance, you may want to wash off ginger root, but you wouldn't want to wash the resin off of the cotton wood buds.

, If you're using fresh plants, you need to chop them up first. They don't have to be very finely chopped. Just give them a rough chop so that their essence is more easily extracted. Try to get the pieces smaller than 1 inch at the least., Choose a jar that creates a tight seal. Place the plants in the jar., Once you've added the plants, pour in enough rubbing alcohol, vodka, or witch hazel extract to cover the plants. You don't want part of the plant sticking out., Once you've combined the ingredients, you need to let them steep. You can wait just a month, but 6 weeks is probably better., Though it needs to steep, you need to help the process along by shaking the mixture up. Once a day is sufficient, but you can do it more often if you wish., Once the time is up, you need to strain out the herbs. Pick a clean, dark jar with a tight-fitting lid. Place a clean piece of cheesecloth or muslin over the jar. Pour the mixture through it, leaving the herbs in the fabric.At this point, you can add a small amount of menthol crystals. How much you add is up to you, but start with a very small amount, just a small pinch. You can always add more.You can also add a few drops of essential oil at this point if you wish., Add a label that includes everything you put in the liniment. Also, make sure you add ""for external use only."" The liniment will keep a long time due to the alcohol., Gently rub a small amount on your skin as you need to do so. Let it dry on your skin."

Assess how much help you need.,
Get the height right.,
Start walking.,
Learn how to sit down or stand up on crutches.,
Learn how to go up or down stairs with crutches.",How to Hold and Use a Cane Correctly2," If you cannot put any weight on an injury, such as if you're recovering from knee or foot surgery, then you'll need one or two crutches (preferably two for improved balance).They'll sustain weight better than canes will, and allow you to get around with only one leg.

, Most crutches are forearm or underarm crutches. After you've been told by a doctor to use one or the other, the only thing you need to worry about is the fit. For underarm crutches, the top should be an inch or a little more below your armpit and the grips should be even with your hips.

, Place both crutches on the ground about a foot in front of you, and lean forward slightly. Move as if you're going to step with your injured side, then shift the weight to the crutches and swing forward between them. Come down on your uninjured leg while holding your injured leg elevated so that no pressure is placed on it.

, Put both crutches together in the hand on your good leg side, like a long and extra sturdy cane. Slowly lower yourself down or up, using the crutches for balance.

, Start by putting both crutches under one arm, parallel to the floor. Then, you can either hop up or down the stairs on your one good leg, using a banister for assistance.


Alternatively, you can lay your crutches down on steps, sit down, and pull them along with you as you use your good leg to sit on the next step.

Apply pressure to the wound with a cloth.,
Clean the wound.,
Disinfect the wound.",How to Improvise a Small Bandage1," You can use a rag, towel, shirt, or any other fabric you have handy. This will help clot the wound and stop bleeding. You can also raise the wound above your head to slow bleeding., It is important to make sure that the wound is clean before you apply the bandage, or else you are at risk of infection. Rinse the dirt from the injured area with clean water, but do not scrub. Dab the wound in a circular motion moving from the center of the wound out towards the edges. Remove any visible dirt or objects.


Water should be clean. Tap water, bottled water, or water that has been boiled and cooled are your best choices, but you can also use clear, running water, such as from a stream, if needed. Avoid cleaning the wound with stagnant or cloudy water.
Do not pull out any objects deeply penetrating the skin. These may be stopping the bleeding, and by removing them, you risk more damage. Similarly, if an object does not wash away easily from the wound, do not pick at it to remove it; simply leave it.Contrary to popular belief, urine is not sterile when it leaves the body. If you do not have access to water, you should not pee on the wound. Gently remove any dirt from the wound with your fingers and let it your natural clotting properties work. Your body’s white blood cells will be more effective at killing bacteria., If you do not have access to topical antibiotics, such as Bacitracin, there are a number of substitutes that work at killing bacteria around the wound and preventing germs from entering.


Petrolatum (also known as petroleum jelly) can be rubbed over the wound to prevent bacteria from entering the cut.Pine sap, honey, and sugar can help seal the wound.You can also try using a saltwater solution.
Use alcohols and strong antiseptics, such as rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol), strong liquor (whiskey, bourbon, etc.), iodine, or hydrogen peroxide sparingly. There is conflicting evidence as to whether or not these hurt or help healing, but if you have a dirty wound, they may disinfect it initially."

Increase your waist size to fit pants over a Boston Brace.,
Try stretch jeans.,
Avoid pants with a low rise waist.,
Layer elastic-waisted pants under your brace.",How to Hide a Scoliosis Brace1," The Boston brace continues over the hip. In order to fit pants over the brace, you will need to go up one size in your pants. Be sure to wear your brace when you go shopping for pants to find the perfect fit.If increasing the size makes the pants seem too big on you, have a tailor take in the seams on the legs for a better fit.;
, Jeans can be a tough fit when you are wearing a brace. Some jeans are made with a combination of denim and lycra, which allows them more flexibility than your average pair of jeans. This can be helpful if you are trying to stretch the waistband over the brace and find that going up in size is creating a poor fit for the rest of the pant.

, This used to be more of a challenge than it is now, but low rise pants are not as trendy as they once were. You can easily find pants with a higher rise, which will be more effective if you are wanting to wear pants to cover the bottom of the brace.

, Avoid trying to fit pants with buttons and snaps underneath the brace. These will dig into your skin and become painful. Leggings and jeggings are in style and fit comfortably under the brace.


While guys may not want to wear leggings and jeggings, they can still take advantage of elastic waistbands by wearing gym shorts, sweats or jogging pants.
Pants with elastic waists can also be stretched over the top of the brace to cover it.

Gather all of the necessary materials.,
Wash your hands.,
Put on a pair of clean gloves.,
Remove the old dressing.,
Assess your wound.,
Apply the new dressing.,
Keep the dressing clean and dry.,
Keep your body clean.,
Report any unusual changes in your wound.,
See your doctor if the wound is not healing.",How to Change a Wound Dressing," Changing the wound dressing will be much more efficient if you do not have to go looking for materials in the middle of changing your dressing. Things to gather before you begin include:


A cleanser to clean the wound, such as povidone iodine or 70% isopropyl alcohol
Sterile dressing, like sterile gauze or a pre-packaged dressing.
Tape that can fasten and stabilize the wound dressing.
Disposable gloves to protect your hand from any debris found in the wound and to protect your wound from harmful microbes on your hand.;
, This will help to remove bacteria from your hands that could transfer to the wound when you change the dressing. Hands harbor a lot of harmful microbes, thus it becomes imperative to limit the number of microbes you expose the wound to.


Wash your hands with warm water and soap for 40 seconds to a minutes. The World Health Organization suggests that you wet your hands. Work up soap into a lather in your hands and then scrub your palms, the backs of your hands, each finger, and all the space in between your fingers—in that order. Rinse your hands with clean water. Dry your hands on a clean towel., After performing the proper hand washing technique described above, your can perform wound dressing with your bare hands. However, as an added precaution, you could wear disposable gloves.


Handwashing eliminates most microbes, but can leave a few bacteria behind.

, To make this process easier, pour liberal amounts of water on the dressing so that the edges of the tape loosen up. You could also try wetting the bandage with a cotton ball that has been dipped in 70% isopropyl alcohol.However, when using the alcohol, use caution so that you do not wet the wound itself, as this can cause pain and discomfort.

, When you have uncovered your wound, take a look at it to see if there are any signs of infection. Note any foul smelling odor, drainage (and what color the drainage is) and the physical appearance of the wound.


It is normal to see redness and swelling during the first few days after you receive the wound, but any foul smell or draining pus means that your wound is infected. Report these signs to your doctor immediately.

, First apply povidone iodine to the wound with the help of a cotton pad or ball. After, apply antibiotic cream to make sure the wound is doubly protected. Cover the wound with sterilize gauze and tape the gauze down around the edges.Do not use povidone iodine if the wound is a surgical or post operative site.
Do not use antibacterial cream for an extended period of time.

, moisture that stays on the wound can stimulate the growth of bacteria and fungus, causing the wound to become infected. If the dressing gets wet, change it.


If the dressing is soiled with blood or drainage, or becomes soiled with mud or dirt, you should change the dressing.

, By keeping your body clean, you can limit the amount of bacteria that your wound is exposed to. However, you should consider taking a sponge bath, as soaking a wound in a bathtub is likely to expose it many microorganisms.


You can take a shower to clean yourself, but try to limit the amount of water that gets on the wound.

, Call your doctor if you see signs of infection, or if any strange things occur around the wound.


Again, if you have a bad smelling odor coming from your wound, pus coming out of the wound, or excessive amounts of pain, call your doctor.

, If your wound has not begun to heal after two weeks, or your wound has not healed fulled by six weeks, there is most likely something wrong. Set up an appointment and meet with your doctor so that the doctor can take a look at your wound.

Apply as needed.",How to Make Liniment2," Gather the rubbing alcohol, myrrh, arnica, goldenseal, and cayenne pepper. Add all of the herbs to an air-tight jar. Then, pour in the rubbing alcohol so that it covers the herbs. Put the lid on, and shake well to mix.The myrrh is an astringent, while the goldenseal is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, according to some liniment makers. Cayenne pepper can increase circulation and act as an astringent. Because goldenseal is expensive, you can use a bit less if you need to do so.

, This liniment needs to steep for about a week. Be sure to keep mixing it up by shaking the bottle at least once a day. You can steep it for longer if you want it to be stronger., Put cheesecloth or muslin over a jar. Pour the liquid through the fabric into the jar. This step will keep the liniment from being gritty. Seal the jar tightly., Make sure to mark it for external use only. Also, add the date you made it and what's in it., Rub it onto sore muscles or places that are bruised or swelling.

, This pad should cover not only the wound itself but the area around the wound. Gauze or a similar open weave fabric is ideal, but if those are not available, you can improvise with any clean cloth, including t-shirts, scarves, or towels. Ideal materials should not be made out of rough or fluffy material.If you have no clean cloth or clothing but do have access to a heat source, such as a camping fire, boil and dry your clothing instead.If you have no access to clean cloth and no way to boil your clothing, assess the extent of your wound. If it is in an area likely to be infected—such as your hands or feet—it is best to bandage it as best you can until you can reach medical aid. If not, you can use the cloth to stanch the bleeding but leave the wound unbandaged., If you have tape or a similar adhesive material, such as a sticker, gently pull it over the cloth. Ideally, the tape should be long enough to stretch over the cloth. Make sure no adhesive is touching the wound. If you do not have tape, you can use a strap, such as a long piece of cloth, ribbon, or cable. Tie it above the bandage pad to apply light pressure to the padding.Be sure you are not constricting your circulation. Tape and wraps should be tight enough to hold the bandage in place but not so tight that your skin turns blue.

, Check your wound every day to make sure there are no signs of infection. When the wound is healed, you may remove the bandage.

Fold the tape over between the notches.,
Apply the bandage.,
Apply as many bandages are necessary.",How to Improvise a Small Bandage3," If you have an open or gaping wound that needs closure, you may need a butterfly bandage. Butterfly bandages are ideal to close narrow gaping wounds by pulling the skin together so that it can heal. These bandages should not be used on wounds larger than 2 inches long (or 5 cm)., Clear cellulose tapes or thick metallic tapes are not ideal but may work in emergencies.

, Pinch the ends of the tape between your index finger and thumb as you fold back. The sticky side of the tape should be facing out towards you.

, There should be two triangles on either side of the tape. Leave about a pinky-sized space between the triangles. If you do it correctly, the triangles will form a small square of space. This will become the non-adhesive pad of the bandage.

, The bandage should now resemble a butterfly or a dumbbell. The folded center should be non-sticky on both sides. This is the part that will lie directly over your wound.

, With clean fingers, gently hold close the wound and stretch the bandage over it. The non-adhesive folded center should be directly over the wound. You do not want any part of the sticky bandage touching your wound.

, There should be one inch or 3 cm between each bandage. The bandage does not need to cover the whole wound, so long as the wound is not bleeding.

Locate a clean, washed tube sock or other sock with a long elastic leg.,
Cut the elastic leg off of the sock.,
Cut a thumb hole.,
Slide the sock over an arm or leg wound gently.",How to Improvise a Small Bandage4," You can use it as a compression bandage to reduce swelling or bleeding.You want a sock that has at least a half-crew or mid-calf length leg. Ankle socks, heel socks and no-shows will not work for this type of bandage. The leg should have strong elastic that has not been over-stretched. It should be tight when pulled over an arm or a leg.

, You should cut just below the ankle or along the “foot-pit” of the sock. You can throw away the rest of the sock or recycle it.

, If you are using this bandage for your hand or wrist, you may want a thumb-hole. Resting the sock lengthwise against your hand, mark where your thumb lies. Cut out a circle roughly one or two inches in diameter and try it on for size.

, Try not to have the fabric rub against the wound as you do so; you may need to stretch out the sock with your fingers so that it is not touching the wound until it is in position.

Go with the flow.,
Cover the brace with a thick material.,
Distract with details.,
Leave room for the tail.,
Match the shape of your brace.",How to Hide a Scoliosis Brace2," Fit shirts loosely over the brace. You don’t want your shirt to hug the brace, which will reveal the shape of the mechanism. You also don’t want to lose your body shape altogether with a shirt which is too baggy. Choose a shirt with shape, but which lays over the brace instead of hugging it.


Guys and girls can wear button down shirts to achieve shape while covering the brace.
Girls should try flowing fabrics and shirts which have detail toward the top and flow out from there.
The brace will make you warmer than usual. When shopping for shirts, consider air flow and lighter material for breathability.

, The thicker the material of your shirt, the less likely the details of the brace will be visible through it. Covering the brace with a sweater or sweatshirt will ensure that the brace does not show through.

, The more embellishments there are to your shirt or dress, the more camouflaged your brace will be. These tricks can include ruffles, tiers, embroidery and patterns. By just choosing a shirt with stripes or plaid, the lines of the brace are going to be less visible.

, You will want a long shirt or a shirt with tails. This is going to cover the part of the brace which extends over your hips. This is especially helpful if you are wearing pants underneath your brace. The long shirt will cover the exposed brace around your hips.


Try button down shirts, sweaters, long t-shirts and tanks.

, If you have a Chêneau brace, you can cover it with an asymmetrical shirt that follows the lines of the brace over one shoulder and longer on that side. This will cover both the extension of the top and the bottom of the brace.


As a bonus, the asymmetrical shape can also help counter the curvature of your spine by creating the illusion of an opposite curve.

Start with a seamless tank top underneath the brace.,
Pull a hoodie over your brace.,
Dress up your outfit with a jacket.,
Match a tight first layer with a loose second.",How to Hide a Scoliosis Brace3," This is especially recommended for people who where the Chêneau brace or a brace which reaches high into the armpit. A tank top which rises higher will protect your armpit and make you more comfortable. You also want to avoid ribbed tanks or seams which might dig into your skin when your brace is tightened.Buy several tanks when you find one that works, so you will have enough to change out every day.
Try Under Armor or Gap’s Modern Crew Tee.

, When the weather is cool, hoodies and cardigans are a great addition to your wardrobe. The thick material combined with the length of hoodies are a perfect cover for any brace. They are also worn over other shirts, which give you the extra buffer between the brace and the exterior layer.

, The outer layer of a jacket or sport coat can add class and style while covering the shape of the brace. If the curvature of your spine is creating uneven shoulders, you can also add a shoulder pad to the inside of on of the shoulders of a jacket to balance out your stance., If you want to wear a tighter dress or a tunic tank, you can add a second, flowing layer, like a light cropped sweater, over the top to cover any lines of the brace and still allow you to comfortably wear the tighter layer underneath.

Cover the top of the brace with a scarf.,
Tie a belt or sash around your waist.,
Avoid the area of the brace altogether with a bold piece of jewelry.",How to Hide a Scoliosis Brace4," If the tips of the brace are visible above the neckline of your shirt, you can drape a scarf around your neck and over the exposed pieces. Scarves also draw the attention up toward you face and away from the brace.Infinity scarves work great for this purpose and will keep you covered with style.

, This can give you shape at your waist, and the thickness of the belt can be pulled tight against your brace without revealing any lines underneath. This is a good trick to try with a long tunic and some leggings.

, Finally, stop worrying about the brace and focus on your amazing style. Get a bold piece of jewelry or an amazing pair of shoes and draw attention away from your brace to your bracelet!

You also need to see if he is in an area big enough for you to move around and help. If the person looks like he is in immediate danger (such as the middle of a street), try to move him to a safe location before you attempt to help him — but do not put yourself in harm's way. If you rush into a dangerous situation, you may also end up injured. Not only does this not help the person you were trying to save, it also gives emergency personnel yet another person to rescue.


Use caution if there is presumed potential neck or spinal injury, such as a person who has fallen from a height or at the scene of an automobile accident where there are signs of additional obvious major trauma.Anyone who has fallen from a height or been involved in an motor vehicle accident should have spinal precautions taken.;
, One of the best ways to check to see if a person is responsive is to talk to her. Ask questions like, ""What is your name?"", ""Are you alright?"", and ""Can you hear me?"" These questions may rouse the victim from whatever haze she is in and make her respond. Also tap her shoulder or arm while you do it to see if that will help as well.


If this doesn't work, try yelling once or twice at her to see if that will rouse her. Yell phrases such as ""Hey!"" or ""Hello!"" to see if she wakes up., A sternal rub may help you to establish that the person is indeed unresponsive. You don't want to do CPR on someone who is just poorly responsive but still breathing and circulating blood. Make a fist and rub your knuckles hard on the person’s breastbone.


You can also try a ""trap squeeze,"" which is when you grasp the muscles of the shoulder by your thumb and fingers and squeeze into the hollow of the collarbone. Bend low as you do this and listen for sounds or signs of breathing.
Anyone who is simply sedated but breathing should rouse from the pain.Note the reaction, if any, to tell to EMS when they arrive.

, Before you can check the airway, the victim needs to be in the right position. If there is any exudate (vomit, blood, etc.) in or around the person's mouth, put on a glove and remove it to clear the airway before you roll her. Roll the person onto her back. This should be on a surface as flat as possible so her body can be straight and easy to work with. Make sure his hands are down by his sides and his back and legs are straight.Take a moment to push her shoulders down gently. This expands the width of the trachea and helps to keep the jaw lifted.

, To open the airway when he is laying on the ground, his head and breathing passages need to be aligned correctly. Place one hand behind his head and one hand under his chin. Tilt his head backward toward the sky.


The chin should end in a slightly lifted position, as if he were sniffing the air., There may be situations where the airway is obstructed. This may be from a foreign object, by the victim's tongue, or by vomit or other bodily fluids. If the airway is obviously obstructed by vomit or any removable matter, get it out of the mouth with a quick swipes with two or three fingers in her mouth. You can quickly turn the victim’s head to one side to assist in the removal.


Try to avoid pushing any matter further down the trachea by only sweeping as far as you can easily see inside the open mouth. Use sweeping motions rather than digging ones.
If the tongue is obstructing the airway, try the jaw thrust method. Crouch above her head, looking down toward the toes. Grasp the jaw gently but firmly with both hands, so that you can curve your fingers into the soft flesh of the chin. Gently lift the jaw to the sky without moving the rest of the head. This helps the tongue to fall to the floor of the jaw, rather than settling in the airway.

, There are a few obvious signs that the victim is breathing. Look for the rise and fall of the chest as he takes oxygen into his lungs. Also look for nose fluctuations as he breathes in through his nose and any opening and closing of his mouth as he breathes in and out.


If there is not a rise of the chest, try to re-position the airway a little in either direction. You may have gone too far or not far enough to open the airway.
If the patient is gasping for breath or breathing poorly, treat this as not breathing and check for circulation., You can check for breath through feel and sound if you can't see any obvious signs of breathing. Place your hand near her nose and mouth to see if you feel any breath. If you don't, lean your head down close to the patient’s mouth and feel for breath on your cheek and listen for any inhales or exhales.


If you hear normal breathing, there is no need for CPR. You should still call 911 if she does not wake up., Opening the airway may be enough to start the victim breathing again. If this happens, roll the victim onto his side so there is less pressure on his chest. This will help him breathe better., Once you find that she is not breathing, you need to check to see if her blood is still circulating. On the lifted area of the chin, place your index and middle fingers to the groove in the neck, just beneath the jaw and to the right or left of the voice box or Adam's apple. Slip your fingers into the groove there. This is the carotid artery and should provide a strong pulse if his blood is circulating well.


If the pulse is weak or if there is no pulse, the person is in trouble and you need to seek medical help., If the person is not breathing or has not pulse, you need to call 911. Emergency services can help treat the victim and find the underlying cause for the collapse once they arrive. If you are alone, call 911 first, then attend to the victim.


If you are with someone else, have them call 911 while you attend to the victim., If the victim is not breathing and his pulse is weak or nonexistent, you need to perform CPR. This will help get his blood pumping, his lungs working, and can help save his life as you wait for medical help. CPR is a life saving technique that can help prolong the life of the victim until professionals can treat the underlying cause of the victim's attack.


Make sure you follow the American Heart Associations guidelines for CPR when you administer it to the victim.Consider taking a CPR class to be fully trained on how to properly administer this life-saving procedure.
There are different methods of CPR for adults and children.

Check the person for neck and back injuries.,
Leave person on the ground to start.,
Put your bodies in the proper position.,
Pull the person to a sitting position.,
Assist the injured person to his feet.,
Wrap your hands around the injured person's waist.,
Place the injured person's arms over your shoulder.,
Move out with the injured person.",How to Carry an Injured Person Using Two People1," Do not attempt to move anyone who may have a neck or spinal injury. Assume a head or neck injury if:


The person complains of severe neck or back pain
The injury has exerted substantial force on the back or head
The person complains of weakness, numbness or paralysis or lacks control of his limbs, bladder or bowels
The person's neck or back is twisted or positioned oddly;
, While you put yourself and the other person in the proper positions to utilize the human crutch, leave the injured party on the ground. This can help ensure that you don’t drop or further injure the person while you shift yourselves into the proper technique., You and the other rescuer should stand on either side of the injured person's chest, facing each other.Making sure you are in the proper position can help minimize the risk of dropping the person or injuring him further.


Each rescuer should grab the wrist of the injured person with whichever hand is closest to the feet. Make sure to only do this on your side of the person.You and your partner’s remaining free hand should grab the person's clothing or nearest shoulder., Once you and your partner have a firm grasp of the injured person, pull her up into a sitting position. Make sure to do this slowly so that you don’t accidentally jostle or lose grasp of the person.Slowly lifting the person to a seated position can also give her circulatory system a chance to stabilize, especially if she’s been lying on the ground. This can help prevent dizziness that may cause the person to fall.
If she is conscious, you may want to verbally check in with the injured person to make sure that this doesn’t cause her any pain or confirm that she is feeling stable.Allow the person to sit at least for a couple of minutes before moving her to a standing position. At this point, instruct person you are going to move her to safety.

, Once the injured person is ready and able, help the person to stand up. If not, lift the person to his feet by grasping clothing items.Give the person as much time as he needs to stand up, as long as there isn’t any other immediate danger. As with sitting, this can help stabilize his blood pressure and help prevent unnecessary falls.If the person is not able to place either a foot or both his feet on the ground, you may need to offer a little bit more support. Remove as much of the weight from his leg or legs as possible in this case.

, Once the person is standing, place your hands around the waist of the injured person. As you begin to move out the person, this can add an extra measure of security while assisting the person.If the person is unconscious, grasp her belt or waistband. Pull on it slightly to lift the person's upper body., Squat down slightly and put the person's arms over your shoulder and that of your fellow rescuer. This should place you in the same direction as the injured person.


The rescuers should use their legs to stand up with the injured person. Make sure to do this slowly to maintain stability of the grasp.Considering asking the person if he is still ok and ready to move out.Don't rush the person — give him plenty of time to stand up.

, Once everyone is standing and facing the same direction, you are ready to move out with the injured person. Make sure to check that the person is secure either by asking her or checking with your fellow rescuer if the person is unconscious. This can not only help ensure that you don’t drop or jostle the person, but also help you more effectively remove the injured party from the situation.The person's legs should be dragging behind you and your fellow rescuer.Make sure to make slow and deliberate movements when dragging out the person to help ensure safety."

Wash your hands.,
Rinse the affected area with clean water to remove all dirt and debris from the wound and the surrounding skin.,
Control bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound.,
Apply a thin layer of topical antimicrobial ointment to the affected area.,
Place a bandage over the cut.,
Change the bandage a few times a day, especially if it becomes wet or dirty.",How to Care for Superficial Wounds1," Open wounds are a gateway for bacteria to enter your body so it is essential that your hands are clean before you start caring for the cut. Use warm water and soap and dry your hands after you are done.If the cut is severe and bleeding heavily, skip the hand washing step and apply pressure to the wound immediately. Once you are controlling the bleeding, seek medical attention.
If you do not have access to water, use wet wipes or alcoholic soap to clean your hands or wear medical gloves.;
, It may be necessary to scrub the wound gently to remove all debris.After you are done, carefully pat the wound dry.
You may also flush the wound with a sterile saline solution if available.

, Use a clean cloth or a towel. Continue applying pressure until the bleeding has stopped or mostly stopped. You may not be able to stop the bleeding entirely and this is fine.If possible, elevate the bleeding part above the level of the heart, such as lifting your arm above your heart or sitting on a chair and elevating your injured leg, to reduce blood flow.
Cool the affected area with a clean cloth dampened with cold water or ice pack wrapped in a towel if necessary (see Tips). The lowered temperature slows down blood flow to the area and reduces bleeding.

, Open wounds are a gateway for bacteria to enter your body. You can reduce the risk of infection by applying antibiotic ointment (such as Neosporin) to the skin around the cut.Only apply a thin layer and use the medication according to the label.
Do not use topical antimicrobial ointment for cuts that are deep and penetrate blood vessels without consulting your doctor first.

, Try to place the bandage so that you bring the edges of the cut together to help seal the cut.Use a non-stick bandage or a sterile pad and tubular bandage to hold the pad in place.

, Take care not to pull the wound apart when you remove the bandage. If the cut begins to bleed, apply pressure until the bleeding stops.


Re-apply antimicrobial ointment (if needed) when you apply a clean bandage.
Keep the cut moist and covered until the skin has had time to heal.
Leave the cut open to air once it has sealed and no longer susceptible to rip open.

You should always have the number to emergency services in your area memorized. After all, it is only three numbers. Look below for a list of some well-known emergency service numbers.


Dial 911(US/Canada)
Dial 999(UK); when using a mobile (cell) phone in UK use 112
Dial 000(Australia)
Dial 112 (Europe)

Other countries and continents have their own numbers, so look yours up if it is not listed here.

, The operator will want to know what type of help you need. In this case, make it clear that there has been a medical emergency and that you need an ambulance immediately. The operator will send the all necessary units to assist you.If the injury happened during the committing of a crime, you will also need police officers sent to your location.
If the injury occurred as the result of a fire or car accident, you will likely need firemen to come to the location as well.

, The operator will ask you a number of questions so that he can inform the proper parties about the situation. When asked, be prepared to provide the operator with the following information:Your location.
The number of the phone you are calling from, if you know it.
If you are in a public place- give the operator the nearest intersection or landmark (example First and Main street).
Tell them your name, the injured person's name and why you need an ambulance. Relate as much medical history as you know.

, The operator will stay on the phone with you until the first emergency responder arrives. The first responder will be followed by an ambulance.The phone operator may give you advice on how to help in the meantime. Follow this advice., The emergency responders may ask you to help them on the scene when they arrive. Stay calm and collected and follow any instructions the first responders give to you. You may be asked to back away from the scene of the injury and wait for further instructions. If this is the case, do not interfere with emergency responders.

, As a general rule, if someone is fully conscious and able to walk there's no need for an ambulance, though they may need to go to the hospital. Only call in scenarios that require on-the-spot medical attention.Minor scrapes, cuts, or bruises are not emergencies.
A broken bone, while it can be dangerous, is often not a “life-threatening” emergency.

, If you are ever unsure about how badly a person is injured, it is better to call emergency services. You are not a trained medical professional and likely do not know how to treat or tend to serious injuries. So let the experts handle it if you unsure what you are dealing with.

, It can be difficult to spot life-threatening emergencies in crisis scenarios. However, there are a few signs that you should be aware of, as they will let you know if emergency services are needed. They are:


The victim is not breathing
The victim is losing excessive amounts of blood
The victim is not moving
The victim is not responsive
The victim is experiencing dizziness, difficulty breathing, or seems to be in shock

, Your first instinct may be to help the injured person, but it is critical that you call for help first. Every second counts. You don’t want to waste valuable time trying to determine if you can help before calling medical professionals., After calling emergency services, there are often things you can do to assist the injured person. Analyze the situation to determine if you can do anything to help before the first responders arrive., If possible, do whatever you can to remove the injured person or persons from further danger. However, it is critically important that when doing this, you do not put yourself at risk of being injured. There is already one emergency, don’t make it two.


If the victim is bleeding a lot, apply direct pressure to the wound to stem the flow of blood. Tie a towel or shirt around the wound, then apply pressure. You can also use any available items around to create a makeshift tourniquet.A belt will do in a pinch, but is not ideal for this.
If the injury occurred in a car accident, you may need to assist by removing the injured individual from a car that is smoking or smoldering. If the injured person is in a dangerous area, like a busy roadway, move her to the side of the road so that she doesn't get hit by a car or other vehicle.Don’t ever approach a vehicle that is already on fire and, if the injured person has suffered a spinal injury, never try to move the person yourself. You could make her injury worse or get yourself blown up., If you are licensed and certified to perform CPR, you may need to do so. Check the injured person’s vital signs. If you don’t detect breathing, perform CPR. The steps are listed below. When performing CPR, begin with chest compressions. Place your fingers over the center of the chest, push down two inches, 30 times. Make sure you pump your hands hard and fast, achieving a rate of at least 100 pushes per minute. You will be pushing down faster than once per second.After pumping the chest 30 times, you will need to blow two breaths of air into the person’s lungs. To do this, gently tilt the injured individual’s head backwards and lift the chin upwards. Then, form a seal between your mouth and the victim’s mouth by pinching his nose and covering his mouth with yours. When providing air, blow until you have seen the injured person’s chest rise up. Blow in two breaths each time. Your breaths should take one second each. Repeat the process for as long as necessary, pumping the chest 30 times for each two breaths of air you give.If you are not familiar with CPR, it is better to allow someone else to administer it, as you could injure the victim in the process.

, You may not know CPR, but someone else around the scene of the injury might. Ask people around the scene to assist you in any way they can to help the victim. If you are attempting to move an individual (without a spinal injury) ask people around the scene for help.

, Even if you can’t provide medical assistance, you can provide moral support. The injured person is likely to be scared or anxious. Sit with her and provide support and comfort until the responders arrive.


Tell the person that help is on the way. Keep talking to her and keep her talking to you.Try to help the individual relax and let her know she is not alone. If she is already on the ground, keep her lying there. If she is upright, have her lie down.If she asks, hold the injured person’s hand or rest a hand on her shoulder to let her know you are still there and willing to help.Listen to the injured person’s requests. Never give food or drink to a victim with unknown injuries. It may hurt more than it helps., Once emergency services arrive, get out of their way and stay out of their way unless otherwise instructed. They are trained professionals who are prepared to respond to emergencies, but they do not need any distractions from you.


In the case of an injury you witnessed, police will likely pull you away from the scene of the injury to ask you questions about what you saw. Follow the officers’ instructions and answer any questions you can while paramedics deal with the injured person.

Identify the injured finger.,
Decide which fingers to tape together.,
Prepare your fingers for taping.,
Tape your fingers together.,
Follow up with a doctor for an evaluation.,
Change the tape regularly.,
Check for signs of infection.,
Be vigilant for signs of necrosis.,
Don't tape a severely fractured finger.",How to Buddy Tape Fingers," Fingers are very susceptible to injury and even breaking when exposed to blunt trauma, such as getting them caught in doors or jammed while playing contact sports. In most cases, it's obvious which finger is injured (the one that hurts the most), but sometimes you need to examine your hand and fingers closely to better understand the injury. Signs of mild-to-moderate musculoskeletal injuries include redness, swelling, inflammation, localized pain, bruising, reduced motion, and maybe some degree of crookedness if your finger is dislocated or fractured.Buddy taping can be used on most finger injuries, even some stress (hairline) fractures, although more serious displaced fractures usually need splinting, casting, or surgery.Small stress fractures, bone chips, contusions (bruises), and joint sprains are not considered serious issues, but severely crushed fingers (mangled and bleeding) or displaced compound fractures (bleeding with bone sticking out of the skin) require immediate medical care, especially if the thumb is involved.;
, Once you've established which finger is injured, you need to decide which adjacent finger to buddy tape it to. In general, try to tape fingers together that are closest in length. The index finger and second finger are usually paired for buddy taping and fingers three and four are usually best taped together.Your thumb, due to its location and range of motion, can't be buddy taped to the index finger, so it's often splinted or casted when severely sprained or broken. In addition, make sure the ""buddy"" finger is uninjured, because taping two injured fingers together may create more problems.


If your third finger (ring finger) is injured, you have the option of buddy taping it to the second or fourth finger. Choose the finger most equal in length, but for the most stability, the ring finger should be buddy-taped to the middle finger.

, Once you've decided on which two fingers to buddy tape together, prepare your finger for taping. Start by washing your hands with soap and water, and then specifically clean the fingers to be taped with alcohol wipes. The alcohol in the wipes (isopropyl alcohol) is not only a good antiseptic, but it also gets rid of any oily or greasy residues that might prevent the tape from sticking to your skin. Use a hypoallergenic or low-irritant wrap underneath the tape if you have especially sensitive skin.If alcohol wipes are not available, the next best alternative is simple soap and water.

, Once you've cleaned and prepared the fingers, take some non-stretch medical, surgical, or athletic tape (about an inch wide) and tape your injured finger to the uninjured one — perhaps using a figure-eight pattern for more stability. Be careful not to bind the fingers too tightly together, because you might create additional swelling and may even cut off the circulation, causing tissue death (necrosis). The taping should be secure enough that both of your fingers move together. Check that there is no numbness, throbbing, color change, or loss of sensation in either finger after the taping.Be cautious buddy taping fingers together if you have diabetes, circulation problems, or peripheral arterial disease, because any significant reduction in blood circulation (from taping too tight) increases the risk of necrosis.
Consider placing a thin strip of padding foam or cotton gauze between the fingers for comfort, protection and prevention of skin abrasions and/or blisters.
Keep in mind that your risk of bacterial infection significantly increases with blistering and abrasions on the surface of the skin.
Materials used for binding fingers include non-stretch medical/surgical paper tape, self-adherent wrap, electrical tape, small Velcro wraps and rubber bandages.
To provide more support (beneficial for dislocated fingers) use a wooden or metal splint along with the tape. Popsicle sticks also work pretty well, just make sure there are no sharp edges that can dig into your skin.

, If an injury is serious enough to warrant taping, it is serious enough to be evaluated. Once your finger is stabilized, you should see a health care provider for a more comprehensive examination. You will likely need an X-ray to make sure you do not have a severe fracture or other damage.


Use the buddy taping method in a pinch until you can seek medical care, but don't use it as a substitute for seeking medical attention.
If you are in pain, you can take an over-the-counter pain reliever to help. Try acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).

, If your fingers are initially taped by your doctor or another healthcare professional, then they likely used water-resistant tape so that it's safe to wash your hands and shower at least once. As a general guideline, however, be prepared to re-tape your fingers on a daily basis, particularly if you shower or wash your hands frequently. Wet or moist tape and dressings promote the growth of bacteria and mold, which gives off an unpleasant odor and increases the risk of a skin infection.


Care should be taken when removing tape to avoid injury aggravation or skin damage. Use blunt-nosed scissors to cut the tape and then remove it slowly.If your injured finger hurts more after re-taping it, remove the tape and start over, but make sure it's a little looser. This is also a sign that you should seek medical advice.
Your injured finger, depending on severity, may need to be buddy-taped for up to four weeks to properly heal, so you'll likely become very experienced at re-taping it., This step is very important. Before reapplying the tape on a regular basis, check your fingers and the rest of your hand for any signs of skin irritation or infection. Abrasions, blisters and calluses increase the likelihood of a skin infection, so clean and dry your fingers thoroughly before re-taping them. Use soap and water to cleanse your hands.


Signs of a localized skin infection include local swelling, redness, throbbing pain, and discharge of pus, which may emit an unpleasant odor.It's important to seek immediate medical attention if you suspect a skin infection.

, As mentioned above, necrosis is a type of tissue death caused by a lack of blood and oxygen. An injured finger, particularly a dislocation or fracture, may already involve damaged blood vessels, so you have to be extra careful when buddy taping not to cut off circulation to the fingers. If you unintentionally do, then your fingers will likely start to throb with achy pain and turn dark red, then dark blue.Most tissue can survive without oxygen for a couple of hours (at most), but it's important to carefully observe your fingers within 30 minutes or so of taping to make sure they are getting enough blood.


Diabetics often have less feeling in their hands (and feet) and tend to have poor circulation. Diabetics should avoid buddy taping and get evaluated by a doctor, as the risk of infection is significant.
If necrosis does occur in the fingers, then bacterial infection can occur quickly. Untreated bacterial infections may turn gangrenous and may require amputation surgery so the infections won't spread.
If you experienced an open compound finger fracture (bone protrudes through the skin), your doctor may recommend a two-week course of oral antibiotics to deter a bacterial infection.

, Although most finger injuries respond well to buddy taping, some are beyond its scope. For example, when fingers are crushed and completely shattered (termed a comminuted fracture) or fractured such that the bones radically misalign and stick out through the skin (termed an open compound fracture), then no amount of taping is helpful and it shouldn't even be considered. Instead, with serious and unstable fractures, you need to get to an emergency department quickly for more appropriate medical care (likely an invasive surgical procedure).On the other hand, small hairline (stress) fractures are stable and appropriate to tape until you can see a healthcare provider.


Common symptoms of a severely broken finger include: intense sharp pain, swelling, stiffness, and usually immediate bruising due to internal bleeding. Likely your finger will look somewhat crooked and it will very difficult to make a fist or grab something heavy without severe pain.
Broken fingers can be related to conditions that weaken bone, such as cancer (bone tumors), local infections, osteoporosis (brittle bones), or chronic diabetes.

Wash your hands with soap and water.,
Stop any bleeding.,
Wash your scrape or abrasion.,
Use an antibiotic ointment.,
Apply a bandage.,
Switch bandages regularly.,
Watch for infection.",How to Care for Minor Abrasions and Scratches," Before you start treating your or another person’s wound, clean your hands with warm water and soap. If you are treating another person, put on disposable gloves.Try to have non-latex gloves on hand because some people have latex allergies.


Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds and dry them on a clean towel.;
, If your scratch or abrasion is still bleeding, apply gentle pressure to it with a clean cloth or cotton swab. Elevate the injured body part to help stop bleeding.The bleeding should cease after a few minutes. If not, your scratch is likely more serious and you should visit a doctor.

, Clean your injury with fresh water and soap. You can use a clean cloth as well.Try to remove any visible dirt. Be gentle so that you do not cause further injury.


You might need to use sterilized tweezers to remove any ingrained dirt. If you cannot reach all the dirt or other objects, see your physician.You should not apply harsh substances like iodine or hydrogen peroxide. These products can hurt your skin.Avoid applying alcohol directly to wounds as well.

, After you have cleaned your wound, use a small amount of antibiotic cream on the the wound. Polysporin or Neosporin are good choices. These products work to fight infection and assist recovery.Quit applying antibiotic ointments if you develop a rash., To protect your scrape from infection, put on a sterile bandage. You do not need to do this if your scrape is minor. For example, if your skin is merely grazed, you likely do not need a bandage. In fact, keeping a wound uncovered can make the healing process go faster., If you apply a bandage to your wound, change it when it becomes wet or soiled. Minimally, apply a new bandage once daily. Once your scrape has scabbed or otherwise healed, apply no more bandages. Giving it access to fresh air will help it heal faster., If your wound appears to be infected, see a doctor. Signs of infection include swelling, redness, a warm wound, oozing of fluids, or escalating pain.Watch additionally for red lines around the scrape or a fever."

Improvise a stretcher to carry the injured person.,
Fashion a stretcher using four hands.,
Carry the person with a chair.,
Construct a chair with your hands.",How to Carry an Injured Person Using Two People2," If person is unconscious or unstable, make a stretcher to carry the person. You can use two poles or some blankets or improvise a stretcher out of whichever materials you have available.Find two sturdy poles, tree branches or other straight pole-like objects and place them parallel on the ground.Take a cloth roughly three times as big as the stretcher should be and lie it on the ground. Put a sturdy pole a third to half of the way along the cloth; fold the section over the pole.
Set the other pole on the two pieces of cloth, leaving enough room for the injured person and enough cloth to fold over this second pole.
Fold the cloth over the pole so that at least one foot of cloth encases the second pole. Take the rest of the cloth and fold it over your poles again.
If you don't have a large cloth or blanket, use blankets, shirts, sweatshirts, or any other cloth you may have available. Do not give up your clothing if this will in any way hamper your ability to assist the person.Check to make sure that the stretcher you’ve fashioned is as secure as possible so that you don’t drop the person., If you don’t have the materials to create a stretcher, you can also fashion one using the hands of yourself and your fellow rescuer.This can provide a more stable position to the person, especially if she is unconscious.The person should be on the ground and the rescuer with his hand closest to the the injured person's head should place his hand under her head for support.
Under the the injured person's chest, at about the level of the lower sternum, each rescuer should grasp for the hand of his fellow rescuer. The rescuers should then interlock their hands for a stable surface.The rescuer with a hand closest to the injured person's feet should place his hand under her legs.Squat down and gently lift the person and move her out.

, If it is available, use a chair to carry the injured person. This is an especially effective method if you and the other rescuer have to climb stairs or navigate narrow or uneven territory.Either pick up the person and place him in the chair or have him sit in the chair if he is able.The rescuer standing at the head of the chair should grasp the chair by the sides of the back with her palms facing in.From here, the rescuer at the head can tilt the chair on to its rear legs.The second rescuer should face the person and grasp the legs of the chair.If you have a longer distance to cover, you and your rescuer should separate the person's legs and pick up the chair by squatting down and lifting., If a chair is not readily available to help your carrying efforts, you and your fellow rescuer can make a chair using your hands. Whether a two- or four-handed seat, you can effectively move the injured person with these seats.A two-handed seat is most useful for carrying people longer distances or for supporting an unconscious person.Squat down on either side of the person. Slide one arm under her shoulders, resting your hand on the shoulder of your partner. Slide your other arm under the knees of the person and grasp the other rescuer’s wrists. Alternatively, you can both make a ""hook"" with your hands by curling your fingers in toward your palm, then hook your hands together.
Lift up from squatting, lifting from your legs and keeping your back straight, and begin moving forward.A four-handed seat is most useful for carrying those who are still conscious.You and your fellow rescuer should grasp each other's wrists — he should grasp your left wrist with his right hand, and you should grasp your right wrist with your left hand. Your right hand should grasp his left wrist, and his left hand should grasp his right wrist.Your hands should form a square shape when locked together in this configuration.
Lower this seat to a height that allows the injured person to sit. Make sure to lower the seat using your legs and not your back to minimize your risk of injury and ensure stability.Have the person drape her arms over your shoulders.
Stand using your legs, keeping your back straight.

Halt the burning process to stop the injury.,
Apply lotion to the burn.,
Take over-the-counter pain reliever if the burn is causing pain.,
Try to keep blisters intact.,
Watch the area for signs of infection.",How to Care for Superficial Wounds2," Even if you are no longer in contact with the cause of the burn (such as an open flame or the sun), tissue damage can continue. Thus, it is essential you reduce further damage first before attempting to clean the injured area.Place the affected part under cool running water for approximately 15-20 minutes.
If the burn is on your face, hands, over a joint, or is large, seek medical attention right away.
Use warm water for less harsh chemicals or when there is chemical exposure to the eyes.
It is also important that you call your doctor if you have a chemical exposure to your eyes or mouth as this can cause more serious complications.
In the case of a chemical burn, you must neutralize the burning chemical. If you are unsure how to do this, seek medical attention.
If you are not near water, apply a cool compress to the area such as an ice pack wrapped in a towel.

, Use aloe vera lotion or gel or a low-dose hydrocortisone cream to protect the skin and help the healing process.Be sure to pat dry the skin before applying any lotion if needed.
Reapply the aloe vera lotion throughout the day to ensure the affected area remains moist, but don't use hydrocortisone cream more than twice a day.

, Burn injuries can be painful and thus you may want to take an over-the-counter pain medication (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen).Use the medication according to the label and do not exceed the recommended dose. In case of severe or continuing pain, seek medical attention.

, Burn injuries often result in blisters -- fluid-filled pockets under your skin.If the blister breaks, rinse the area with water, apply antimicrobial ointment and cover the area with a non-stick bandage.

, If redness, tenderness, swelling or drainage develops, apply antimicrobial ointment and cover the burn with clean gauze to protect it while it heals.


Contact a physician if the burn gets worse, doesn't appear to ease, it looks infected and is not getting better quickly with home care, or develops severe blisters or discoloration of any kind.

"
"
Wash your hands before attempting to care for the wound.,
Rinse the affected area with clean water to remove dirt and debris.,
Apply pressure with a clean cloth to stop bleeding.,
Apply a thin layer of antimicrobial ointment over the area.,
Cover the wound with a clean dressing or a bandage.,
Watch the area for signs of infection (redness, pain, pus or swelling).",How to Care for Superficial Wounds3," Use warm water and soap and rinse at least for 30 seconds to ensure your hands are clean.Also, dry your hands well before touching the affected area to reduce the risk of infection.

, If washing does not remove all debris, use tweezers cleaned with alcohol to remove the particles. Also, remove the object that caused the puncture if still present.If the object that caused the puncture is still inside your skin and cannot be removed completely, or if you cannot remove the object without causing further damage, seek medical attention.

, If bleeding occurs, apply pressure to stop it. You can use a clean cloth to press the injury or, if available, an ice pack wrapped in a towel.Depending on the type and size of the injury, the puncture might not be bleeding at all., Do this ONLY for superficial wounds. If the wound is large, open and affects deep tissues, do not apply any topical medication and seek medical attention.

, This will help keep the wound clean and reduces the risk of infection and other complications.Change the bandage a few times a day and every time it gets wet or dirty.
Consult your doctor whether you should receive a tetanus booster shot within 48 hours. This is usually recommended if it's been more than 5 years since you've had a tetanus shot. Even minor puncture wounds can lead to infection.

, If the wound is not healing or you notice excessive pain, warmth, redness and/or drainage, seek medical attention immediately.

"
"
Wash your hands thoroughly.,
Rinse the wound with clean water to wash away dirt.,
Cover the wound with a bandage.",How to Care for Superficial Wounds4," Use warm water and hand soap to wash away visible dirt. Avoid touching the wound with dirty hands as this can lead to infection.If you do not have access to clean water, use gloves or a wet wipe to clean your hands.

, Be careful not to rip the loose piece of skin (if still attached) apart. Gently pat or air-dry the affected area afterward.

, If the loose piece of skin is still present, place it back over the wound to cover it before you apply the bandage. This will help seal the wound.


Optionally, you can also use a nonstick, non-adhesive sterile pad and a tubular bandage to hold the pad in place.
Change the bandage a few times a day, especially if it becomes wet. Carefully remove the old bandage, rinse the wound gently if needed, and apply a new bandage.

Allow time to heal.",How to Bandage Fingers or Toes," Seek medical attention if the injury involves protruding bones, deep cuts or lacerations, numbness, or if large areas of skin have been removed. In the worst cases, some parts of skin or even the finger or toe may have been partly or entirely cut off. If this happens, put the appendage on ice and take it with you to the emergency care facility., Apply pressure to the area using a sterile dressing or clean cloth until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding does not stop after five to 10 minutes of constant pressure, seek medical attention.

If available, use Telfa bandages, which do not leave fibers in the wounds or impede clotting and are best.

, Use fresh water, sterile dressing pads, or clean cloths. Wash your hands before you begin if you have time. Clean out any dirt or debris that may be located in the wound. Touching a fresh wound can be painful, but cleaning it thoroughly and carefully is important in order to prevent infection.

Clean the area surrounding the wound, using sterile dressings dampened with saline or clean water. Wipe away from, not toward or into, the injury in all directions.

, After the bleeding has stopped and the area has been cleaned, it is easier to see damage that was not clear at first, such as visible bone or bone fragments. Most injuries that occur to fingers and toes can be managed at home by using proper methods of cleaning, bandaging, and monitoring the injured area., For deep cuts and lacerations, stitches may be needed. Apply a butterfly band-aid, if available, to pull together the split areas of the skin until you can get to a medical facility. Use several butterfly band-aids for larger areas. This will help to prevent infection, control the bleeding, and help the doctor to assess the area for stitches.

If butterfly band-aids are not readily available, use regular band-aids and pull the skin together as tightly as possible. Avoid placing the adhesive part of the band-aid directly on the wound.

, Symptoms of a broken bone can include pain, swelling, stiffness, bruising, deformity, and difficulty moving the finger or toe. Experiencing pain when putting pressure on the area or trying to walk can mean a bone has been fractured., In many cases, even broken bones and sprains can be managed at home. However, if the area looks deformed, is cold, pale, or without a pulse, this indicates the broken parts of the bone have separated from each other. Prompt medical attention is needed to realign the separated sections of bone., Broken bones involving the big toe are harder to treat at home. Bone fragments can become dislodged, damage to ligaments or tendons may have occurred during the injury, and risks of infection and arthritis may be greater if the area does not heal properly. Consider seeking medical help if the big toe appears to be broken.Buddy taping the injured toe to to its neighbor with a turn or two of medical tape will help support the broken toe while you go to the hospital.

, Avoid applying ice directly to the skin. Ice can be placed in a baggie, then wrapped in a small towel or other material. Some finger and toe injuries do not involve cuts, scrapes, bleeding, or any areas of broken skin. The finger or toe may be sprained, or one of the bones may be broken, yet the skin is still intact. Apply the ice for 10 minutes at a time.

, For minor cuts and scrapes, the purpose of the bandage is to prevent infection and promote healing. For more serious injuries, the bandage can help to prevent infection and provide protection for the injury while it heals., A finger or a toe injury can involve damage to the skin, the nail, the nail bed, sprained ligaments and tendons, or broken bones. For injuries that only need protection from infection, simple dressings and regular band-aids will work fine., If the skin is broken, then properly dressing the area will prevent infection and control further bleeding. Use sterile pads, sterile gauze (Telfa works best), or very clean materials to cover the entire wound. Try not to touch the sterile part of the dressing that will be directly in contact with the wound., The risk of infection is increased with injuries that involve cuts, scrapes, or torn areas of the skin. Applying the antibiotic cream or ointment directly to the dressing is a good way to help prevent infection without directly touching the wound., Bandages are to be applied not too tightly, but tight enough to keep the dressing in place. Bandages that are too tight can interfere with blood flow., Be sure to cut or secure any loose ends from dressing material, bandages, or tape. This can cause pain, and possibly further damage, if the loose ends get caught or snagged on something., Unless the tip is part of the injury, leaving it exposed helps to watch for changes that might indicate problems in circulation. Plus, if medical attention is needed, leaving the ends of fingers and toes exposed helps doctors to evaluate for nerve damage., The fingers and toes can present challenges when they need to be bandaged. Gather materials that are larger than the area, so you can cut the large gauze, sterile dressing pads, and medical tape, in sizes suited to the area., Cutting the material this way helps to securely cover the tips of the injured finger or toe. The cut pieces should be designed to be twice the length of the finger or toe. Apply the bandage along the length of the finger or toe first, then down the other side. Wrap the other ends around the area., Use additional pieces of tape as need to secure the bandage in place. Also take care to cover all areas of broken skin with dressing materials, before applying the final bandage, in order to prevent infection., The bandage you apply may need to provide protection, prevent infection, promote healing, act like a splint, and prevent further damage to the injured area. , A splint helps to immobilize the injury and prevent further, accidental injury. Select a splint that is the proper size for the injured digit. In some cases, a regular popsicle stick can be used as a splint.Try to immobilize the joint above and below the injury site with the splint. If the injury is to the first joint of the finger, this means try to immobilize the wrist and joints above the injury. This keeps the surrounding muscles and tendons from straining the injury or becoming damaged themselves.

, Carefully folded pieces of dressing material can be used between the injured digit and the splint to provide some cushion and prevent irritation., Use medical or paper tape to secure the splint, taking care not to wrap the area too tightly. Apply the medical or paper tape lengthwise first, with the digit on one side and the splint on the other, then wrap around the injured digit and the splint to keep it in place. Take caution not to wrap the area too tightly, but tight enough so the splint does not slide off., An adjacent finger or toe works just as well as a splint in most cases. Buddy taping helps to prevent free movement of the injured digit to allow the area to heal properly.Most commonly, fingers and toes 1 and 2, or 3 and 4, are paired or taped together. Always place small sections of gauze between the digits being paired to prevent irritation., Cut or tear 2 sections of non-stretch, white, medical tape. Wrap each piece around the areas just above and below the injured joint or break in the bone, including the buddy digit in the wrapping. Be careful to wrap securely but not too tightly., Once the digits are anchored to each other, proceed with wrapping additional sections of tape around both digits to secure them to each other. This method allows for the digits to bend together, but side to side movement will be restricted., In some cases, blood can accumulate under the nail of the injured finger or toe, and can cause unwanted, added pressure and possible further damage to the injury. A medical procedure can be done to relieve the pressure., Even minor cuts or scrapes may require a tetanus booster shot to prevent serious infections. Adults should get a tetanus booster every 5 to 10 years., Developing a fever, chills, sudden numbness or tingling, or a sudden increase in pain or swelling warrants seeking medical help sooner, rather than later., It usually takes about 8 weeks for a broken bone to heal. Sprains and joint injuries may heal more quickly. If problems linger, see a doctor. If symptoms get worse, such as pain and swelling, beyond the first 2 to 3 days, medical attention may be warranted."

Do not move someone if you think she has a spinal injury.,
Stabilize someone with a spinal injury.,
Roll the person onto her side if necessary.",How to Carry an Injured Person by Yourself During First Aid1," Moving her could increase the damage and even cause her to be paralyzed. If you are unsure if the person has a spinal injury, then you should proceed as if she does. Signs of a spinal injury include:Having a head injury, particularly one that involved a blow to the head or neck.
Showing changes in the state of consciousness, for example, being unconscious or confused.
Experiencing pain in the neck or back.
Not moving the neck.
Experiencing weakness, numbness, or paralysis in the limbs.
Losing control of the bladder or bowels.
The head or neck is twisted in a strange position.
Reacts to painful stimulus (trapezius pinch or sternal rub) by flexing all her limbs inward or by extending all her limbs out (referred to as posturing).;
, If the person’s head or body moves, it may increase the damage to the spine. You can prevent this by:Putting towels or pillows on both sides of the person’s head to prevent it from rolling or slipping.
Providing first aid, like CPR, without moving the head. This means that you should not tilt the person’s head back to open the airway. Instead, use the jaw-thrust method.
Not taking the person’s helmet off if he was wearing one. For example if he had a bike or motorcycle helmet on, leave it so you don’t move the spine.

, This should only be done if the person is in immediate danger, for example if she is vomiting or choking on blood. Under these circumstances, you may have to roll the person onto her side. It is important to do this with at least one other person so that you can prevent the person’s body from twisting.One person should be positioned at the head and the other at the injured person’s side. The two of you must coordinate so that the spine remains aligned while the person is rolled. Twisting can cause additional damage to the spine.
While rolling, wait for the lead person's cue. Roll by grabbing the opposite shoulder and hip, rolling the patient toward you. While the person is in this position, check her back and neck quickly for obvious injuries.

Know when the wound needs immediate medical attention.,
Control the bleeding.,
Remove any visible debris.,
Remove or cut clothing away from the wound.,
Rinse the wound thoroughly.,
Clean the wound with a washcloth or other soft cloth.,
Find an appropriate bandage.,
Secure the dressing and cover it.,
Change the dressing daily.,
Keep an eye out for signs of infection.",How to Bandage a Wound During First Aid," Although most minor wounds can be bandaged with a Band-Aid and most moderate skin wounds with dressings and medical tape, some are too serious for home care. For example, skin wounds that also involve seriously broken bones need immediate medical attention, as do major injuries to blood vessels that won't stop gushing blood.Wounds to the arms and legs that cause numbness or loss of sensation below the injury may indicate nerve damage, which is also an indication to seek medical care.


Severe loss of blood will quickly make you feel weak and tired (and maybe pass out), so tell someone around you of the seriousness of your injury right away, or call 9-1-1 for assistance.
If you have a deep skin wound to your abdomen, your organs may be injured and bleeding internally, so try to get to an emergency medical facility as quick as you can — but get someone to drive you because you might lose consciousness, or call an ambulance.;
, Before you clean and bandage a wound, try to get any bleeding under control. Using a clean, dry bandage (or any clean absorbent cloth), apply very gentle pressure over the wound to control the bleeding. In most cases, the pressure on the wound will promote blood clotting and the bleeding should stop within 20 minutes, although it may continue to ooze a little for up to 45 minutes.The bandage or cloth will also help prevent bacteria from entering the wound and causing infection. In severe cases, a tourniquet can be made by using a neck tie or long piece of cloth to tie a tight knot just above the wound.


If significant bleeding continues even after you apply pressure for 15-20 minutes, the wound may need immediate medical attention. Continue applying pressure and get to a doctor's office, emergency room, or urgent care center.
If the bleeding is difficult to control, the person may be on blood thinners or have underlying clotting issues. In these cases, the person should be brought to the attention of a medical professional.
Before coming in contact with the wound, put on sanitized medical gloves if available. If gloves aren't available, wrap your hands in some sort of clean barrier such as a plastic bag or multiple layers of clean cloth. Use your bare hands to apply direct pressure to the wound only as a last resort because contact with blood can spread infectious diseases.
Furthermore, use soap and water to disinfect your hands before contacting the wound, if possible. Doing so will minimize the possibility of transferring bacteria from your hands to the exposed injury.

, If there are large pieces of dirt, glass, or other objects embedded in the wound, try to remove them with a clean set of tweezers. Rinsing the tweezers in rubbing alcohol first will help to prevent the transfer of bacteria and other microbes.Take care not to cause further damage by pushing the tweezers into the wound itself.


If you're dealing with a gunshot injury, don't probe around the wound and try to pull out the bullet — leave that for medical professionals.
If you are struggling to remove large pieces of debris from the injury site, consider leaving it for healthcare professionals rather than trying to handle it yourself. Pulling out large debris that is entangled with blood vessels may trigger more bleeding.
Some first-aid experts recommend waiting to remove all debris until after you’ve rinsed the wound. If you see only small bits of dirt or grime, this might be the better way to approach the situation, since rinsing will likely wash away the small stuff.

, To get better access to the wound once the bleeding is under control, remove any clothing and jewelry from the general area of the injury. This should be done so that if the wounded area swells, the tight clothing or jewelry won't affect blood flow.For example, if you're dealing with a bleeding hand wound, remove the wrist watch above the wound. In terms of clothing, if you can't remove it from around the wound, then consider cutting it away with blunt-nosed safety scissors (ideally). For example, if you're dealing with a thigh injury, remove the pants or cut them away from the wound before trying to clean and bandage it.


If you can't get the bleeding under control, you may have to use the ripped clothes or belt to make a tourniquet, which puts pressure on the arteries above the wound. However, tourniquets should only be used in emergency life-threatening situations and for short-periods of time because tissue starts to die within a few hours of not getting any blood.
Once clothes are removed to clean and bandage the wound, they may need to be used as a makeshift blanket to cover the injured person and keep them warm.

, In the best case scenario, wash out the wound thoroughly with saline solution for at least a few minutes until it looks free of dirt and debris. Saline solution is ideal because it decreases the bacterial load by rinsing it away and is typically sterile when bought packaged. If you don't have access to saline solution, then use clean drinking water or tap water, but make sure you let it run over the wound for a few minutes. Squeezing it out of a water bottle works well for this, or hold the wound under the tap if possible. Don't use hot water; instead use lukewarm or cool water.


Saline solution can be purchased commercially.
Some experts recommend using a mild soap, such as Ivory dish-washing liquid, to get the wound as clean as possible, but sometimes soap can irritate injured tissue.If you're cleaning a wound near the eye, be careful not to get soap in the eye.

, Using very gentle pressure, pat the wound with a clean cloth to make sure that it is completely clean after you've flushed it out with saline solution or regular running water. Do not push too hard or scrub too vigorously, but make sure you’ve removed any remaining debris. Keep in mind that gentle scrubbing may cause a bit more bleeding to occur, so reapply pressure to the wound after the cleaning.


Apply an antibacterial cream to the wound at this stage prior to bandaging, if available. Antibacterial creams or ointments, such as Neosporin or Polysporin, help prevent infection. The cream will also keep the dressing from sticking to the wound.
Alternatively, you may wish to add natural sanitizer to the wound, such as iodine solution, hydrogen peroxide, or colloidal silver (which is the only one that won't sting).Evaluate the wound after cleaning. Some wounds need stitches to heal properly. If you notice any of the following signs, seek medical attention rather than trying to bandage the wound yourself: the wound appears to be quite deep, it has jagged edges and/or it won't stop bleeding., Pick out a sanitized (still in its wrapper) and appropriately sized bandage for the wound. If it's a smaller cut, then a bandage with self adhesive (such as a Band-Aid) is likely best for the job. However, if it's a larger cut not appropriate for a Band-Aid, the you'll need to use a larger piece of dressing. You may have to fold or cut the dressing so it just covers the wound. Be careful not to touch the underside of the dressing (the side that will lay against the wound) in order to reduce the risk of infection. If you don't have an adhesive bandage and plan on taping the dressing in place, leave a little extra material on the edges so the tape doesn't stick directly to the wound.


If you don’t have actual dressings and bandages available, you can improvise using any clean cloth or piece of clothing.
Lightly smearing the wound with antibiotic cream is beneficial not only to deter infection, but it will prevent the bandage or dressing from sticking directly to the wound.A bandage or dressing that sticks is likely to cause more bleeding when it's removed.
Butterfly bandages are helpful for holding the edges of a wound together. If you have a butterfly bandage, place it across the cut (rather than lengthwise) and pull the edges of the wound closer together., Use non-stretch, water-resistant medical tape to attach the dressing to the skin on all sides. Make sure the tape contacts healthy, uninjured skin. Avoid using industrial tape like duct tape or electrician's tape, which may tear the skin when you remove it. Once the dressing is taped over the wound, completely cover the dressing with a clean elastic wrap or stretchy bandage for further protection. Make sure that you don't wrap the bandage too tightly and cut off circulation to the wound or any part of the wounded person's body.


Secure the elastic outer bandage with metal clips, safety pins, or tape.
Consider placing a layer of plastic between the dressing and the outer bandage if there is strong likelihood that the wounded area will get wet. The extra layer of plastic will also provide additional protection from bacteria and other infectious agents.
If the wound is located on your head or face, you may have to wrap the bandage around like a bandana and tie it tightly enough to keep it in place, Replacing the old dressing with a fresh one each day keeps the wound clean and promotes healing. If the outer elastic wrap bandage remains clean and dry, then you can reuse it. If your cut was small enough to use a Band-Aid, then change that daily as well. Over the course of a day, if your dressing and/or bandage gets wet, then change it immediately and don't wait for the following day. Wet dressings and bandages promote infection, so always try to keep them clean and dry. If a dressing or Band-Aid is stuck to a newly formed scab, then soak it in warm water to soften the scab and make the dressing or bandage easier to remove.To prevent this problem, use a nonstick bandage if available.


Signs of healing include reduced inflammation and swelling, less or no more pain and the formation of a scab.
Healing of most skin wounds occurs within a few weeks, but deeper cuts can take up to a month to fully heal., Despite efforts to keep your skin wound clean and dry, sometimes it can become infected. This is common if you were cut deeply by something rusty or dirty, or if you were bitten by an animal or person. Signs that indicate that your skin wound is infected include: increased swelling and pain, discharge or yellowish or greenish pus, the skin turns red and is very warm to the touch, high fever, and/or a feeling of malaise.If you notice any of these signs within a few days of your injury, see a doctor right away. They will likely prescribe antibiotics or other treatments to fight the infection.


Any red streaking of the skin around the wound may indicate an infection in the lymph system (system that drains fluid from tissues).This infection (lymphangitis) can be life threatening, so prompt medical care should be sought.
Consider a tetanus shot. Tetanus is a serious bacterial infection that can develop from an infected wound, especially if you were punctured by a dirty object. If you have not received a tetanus booster within the past 10 years, you should see a doctor and get caught up on your shots.

Use the human crutch method.,
Drag the person to safety.,
Carry a child using the cradle method.,
Carry a larger person like a backpack.",How to Carry an Injured Person by Yourself During First Aid2," If the person is conscious and can move on his own, this method might be the most effective. It can be used if the person has an injury to only one leg.Crouch with your knees bent and back straight next to the injured person on the side of the injury. Have the person sit up and wrap his arm over your shoulder. Slowly stand, allowing the injured person to support himself with his good leg. You will support his weight on the side with the injury. Hold his hand around your shoulders with the hand furthest from him. Put your other hand around his waist.
Help him balance as he hops to safety. This enables him to minimize the amount of weight that must go on the injured leg.

, The drag method is safer than lifting the person, for both you and the injured person. Lifting increases the amount of weight that you must support and it puts the person at risk of falling. Always pull slowly and steadily, moving the person in as straight a line as possible. You want to keep the person’s spine aligned so that it does not twist or bend unnaturally. Which type of drag you use will depend on the injures that the person has.Leg drag —This method is used when the person has no leg injuries, but cannot walk. Bend at your knees so that your back remains straight, but you can hold the person’s ankles. Lean back and slowly and steadily use your weight to drag the person to safety. Be careful not to drag the person over surfaces or objects that may injure her. If you are sure that the person has not suffered a spinal injury, you can lift the head and put something underneath to protect it. If you think the person might have a spinal injury, you should move the head as little as possible.

Arm drag — This method is necessary when the person has leg injuries. Bend your legs and keep your back straight. This will protect your own back. Lift the person’s arms above the head and grasp the person by the elbows. Squeeze the elbows against the sides of the head so that it remains supported and does not drag on the ground. Use your own weight to lean back and slowly drag the person to safety.

Clothing drag — If the person has injuries on both the arms and legs, it may be necessary to drag her by her clothing. If you use this method, pay attention to the clothing to make sure that it doesn’t suddenly tear and cause the person’s head to bang on the ground. Bend your knees and grip the clothing under the armpits. Lean back and use your weight to drag the person.

, This method is quick and easy but it can only be used for children and people who are much smaller than the rescuer. Because the person’s entire weight hangs on your arms, you will tire quickly.Scoop the child up so that you are carrying him in front of you with one hand around his back and the other under his knees.
Bend at the knees and keep your back straight when lifting. If you injure your back in the process of lifting the person, you won’t be able to help as effectively.

, This method can be used if the person is too large for you to carry in the cradle position or the person must be carried too far for you to maintain the cradle position. It can be used for people who are unconscious.Start with the injured person on her back. Bend her legs and stand with your feet on her toes. Pull her up by her wrists to a standing position.
As you put the person into a standing position, rotate so that the person’s chest is against your back and her arms are over your shoulders. This allows you to hold the person’s arms, tip forward slightly at the waist, and carry the person like a backpack.

Learn to do compressions.,
Understand how to clear an airway.,
Focus on breathing.,
Put people in recovery position.",How to Become CPR Certified2," This is designed to restore blood flow. In a CPR course, your trainer will teach you to properly do chest compressions on adults and infants. You will learn:


Put the victim on his back.Kneel at the victim’s side.
Put the heel of your hand in the proper position on the victim’s chest (between the nipples). Stack you hands on top of one another. Keep your elbows straight and your shoulders squared and directly above your hands.
Use your upper body weight and press straight down. Push hard at about 100 compressions per minute.

, After chest compressions, you should learn how to clear a person’s airway. Generally, you do this by the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver. To do this:


Gently lift the victim’s forehead with your palm. Then, gently tilt the head back.
With your other hand, tilt the chin forward.
Check for normal breathing and look for chest motion.
Begin mouth-to-mouth breathing if the victim is gasping or not breathing normally.

, In your CPR course, you will learn how to properly give mouth-to-mouth breathing. To do this:


After the victim’s airway is clear (using the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver), pinch his nostrils closed.
Cover the victim’s mouth with your own to create a seal.
Prepare to give two rescue breaths. Give a one-second breath and watch to see if the chest rises. If it does, give the second breath.
If the chest doesn’t rise, repeat the airway clearing maneuver (head-tilt and chin lift) and try again.
After giving rescue breaths, give thirty chest compressions.
Continue CPR movements until there are signs of movement or medical personnel arrive.

, A recovery position is designed to keep the victim’s airway open.This will also ensure that the victim will not choke from fluids or vomit. In a CPR class, you will learn to:


Get down on the ground near the victim.
Place the victim’s arm, the one nearest to you, at a right angle toward his head.
Tuck the victim’s other arm up toward his head so that the back of his hand is touching his cheek.
Bend his knee, the one furthest from you, in a right angle.
Carefully roll him on his side by pulling his bent knee. At this point, his arm should be cushioning his head.
Tilt his head back slightly; this will ensure his airway is open.
Stay with the person and monitor his condition.

Expect the course to take a few hours.,
Prepare to take a written exam, in some cases.,
Prepare to take a skills check.,,You will be required to demonstrate that you are able to perform CPR and other lifesaving duties.,
Remember to recertify.",How to Become CPR Certified3," In general, a basic CPR course takes around three hours to complete. These courses might run longer or shorter depending on the audience of the class.For example, if you are just renewing your CPR certification, it might take less time than a classroom full of new students.

, Some certifications, such as the AHA’s BLS course, has a 25 question test that you must get a 84% or higher on to pass.These questions cover the material covered in your class including how to respond in emergency situations. You can take a pretest on the AHA’s website that might help you prepare., This may include:


Checking patient for response.
Activating emergency response signal.
Opening airway using chin-tilt method.
Checking breathing.
Checking carotid pulse.
Locating CPR hand position.
Delivering appropriate CPR compressions.

, Certifications generally last around two years. You will need to retake the course to renew.


Expiration dates appear at the bottom of your CPR certification card."

Identify accredited programs.,
Avoid scams.,
Pay the fee.",How to Become CPR Certified4," You want to make sure that you will be receiving a certification from an accredited source.It is always best to go through a known organization (example: AHA, Red Cross) that specializes in health and safety.Their websites have detailed information about their programs and certificates.
Some online programs may try and sell certificates that are not associated with national institutions. Do not pay for programs that promise certifications with no skill checks, or does not provide certificates through the mail.Sometimes, online programs will promise an instant electronic course card upon completion of a course. Most often, these are fraudulent and should be avoided.

, A legitimate company will never try and sell you a product. National organizations warn users about scams that try and sell insurance or other products.Avoid and be wary of anyone who asks you to:


Provide financial or personal information such as personal identification numbers, social security numbers, or passwords
Buy insurance on behalf of the AHA or other national organizations
Purchase exam answers for certification programs

, To become certified, you must pay the fee to take the course. The prices vary. A basic CPR course is about $30."

Make sure victim is comfortable.",How to Backboard a Spinal Injury Victim in the Water," Let others know about the situation so they can assist in the rescue.


Blow your whistle and clear the pool.
Have another lifeguard or a person nearby call 911.
Have another lifeguard or person grab the Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) and bring it to you.
Have a secondary lifeguard bring you a backboard.;
, After activating the EAP, carefully slide into the water and walk towards the victim. Avoid making a large splash and making waves in the water. They could jostle the victim and hurt them more.

, Carefully raise the victim's arms above his/her head, bringing them to a point. Firmly hold the victim's arms in that position, bracing them against his/her head in order to immobilize the head and neck. Be sure to keep their body in a straight line parallel to the surface of the water so to not bed their spine.


Once you establish stabilization of the head and neck, do not break that stabilization. It could cause paralysis of the victim. You can change the method of stabilization, but do not break it.

, While you are holding the victims arms against his/her head, have your secondary lifeguard approach you with the backboard.


Instruct them to come up to the side of your body in which you are holding the victim.
Have them tilt the backboard all the way on its side and swiftly dunk it straight down into the water.
As the board begins to rise back to the surface and lay flat again, instruct your secondary guard to position it beneath the victim so that his/her head will be within the head restraint box.

, Once the backboard is placed, you must begin preparation to secure the victim to the board by first changing the head-splint technique being used and then the position of the backboard in the water.


Have your secondary guard firmly grasp the victims chin with one hand while resting their forearm down the middle of the victim's chest. Have them place their other hand on the bottom of the board to stabilize it.
After your secondary guard has taken control of immobilizing your victim's head and neck, gently walk the backboard over to a pool wall. Stand behind the board with your back against the wall. Lower the victim's arms down to his/her sides and regain control of the immobilization of the head and neck by placing one hand on either side of the victim's head over each of his/her ears.

, When you position yourself at the wall, you will need additional support for the backboard. Your secondary lifeguard can do this by placing rescue tubes beneath the back board.


Have your secondary lifeguard dunk one rescue tube beneath the water and slide it underneath the head of the board by where you are standing.
Have them then do the same thing, but place the tube under the foot of the board.

, To ensure the victim's safety when being removed from the pool and also for added immobilization, he/she must be secured with the straps attached to the backboard. Your secondary guard will preform this task while you maintain control of the victim's head and neck.


Starting at the top of one side of the board, place the first strap under the victim's arm, but over his/her chest. Placing this first strap underneath the victim's arm before it goes over his/her chest secures the victim so they will not slip down and off the board when it is removed from the water. It holds them in place.
Place the next strap over both the arm and chest. Since the first strap secures the victim from slipping down, the remaining straps can just go over everything.
Continue down that side of the backboard until all of the strap on that side have been placed.

, Repeat the previous process on the opposite side of the board. Do not reach over the board to do this as that may further harm the victim. Make sure, once again, that the first strap goes under the arm and over the chest, while the remaining straps go over everything. Once you have positioned each strap correctly, connect it to the coordinating strap by whatever means provided (Velcro, buckle, etc.).

, Once the victim's body is strapped into the backboard, his/her head must also be restrained using the head restraints provided with the board.


Have your secondary lifeguard approach one side of the victim's head
Instruct them to line the head restraint up with your hand and the victim's head
On your count, have them slowly slide the restraint down along the side of the victim's head as you slowly pull your hand away
Once the restraint it in place, replace your hand on the restraint as if you were still holding the victim's head.
Repeat this procedure on the other side of the victim's head.

, Once both of the restraints are in place, use the head restraint strap attached to the head restraint portion of the board to completely immobilize the victim's head.


Place the strap so that it lies across the victim's forehead.
Secure the strap on the opposite side of the board.

, After finishing securing the victim to the board, grab one side of the board as you move from behind the head of the board to standing next to it. With the help of your secondary guard, place the top edge of the board on the gutter of the pool.

, After placing part of the backboard on to the gutter of the pool, hold the board as your secondary guard climbs out of the pool. Once out, instruct your secondary guard grab the top of the board as you move to the foot of the board.

, Once in place, instruct your secondary guard to pull the backboard towards them and away from the water as you push. Make sure your secondary guard keeps the board low to the ground to prevent dropping it and causing further harm to the victim.

, If the victim has any other injuries such as a cut or bump, treat accordingly. This might include applying a Band-Aid, icepack, or gauze patch.

, While waiting for EMS to arrive, make sure victim is comfortable. For example, if they are cold, cover them with a towel/ emergency blanket.

Power tools and machines.

Saws, drills, and other woodworking tools.

Keep all guards and safety features in good condition. Many experienced craftsmen end up at the hospital when they circumvent or disable safety features to speed a job up, or make a task easier. Blocking guards, removing safety switches, and crowding workpieces is not worth the risk.
Check the machine's condition. Tag out defective tools, replace damaged power cords, and inspect blades before use.
Use recommended safety equipment, such as eye and hearing protection, gloves, and boots.
Avoid jewelry and loose fitting clothes, and keep long hair tied back or tucked under a cap.


Garden equipment.

Avoid obstacles when using a mower, weed-eater, or tiller.
Use the correct techniques for each piece of equipment. Read the owner's or operator's manual for specific instructions.
Keep the machine in good working condition, including sharpening or replacing dull blades, replacing loose belts, and cleaning the machine after each use.


Household appliances.

Never use electrical appliances near water. An exception may be made when using a Ground Fault Receptacle, but this is not a guarantee of your safety, as these devices can be subject to failure.
Plug appliances into the correct type of receptacle. Do not remove a grounding prong from a three prong plug to adapt it for use in a two prong receptacle.
Never use excessive extension cords. The length of extension cord you may use is determined by the amperage of the appliance, and the gauge (size) of wire. A good rule of thumb is:

15 Amps 100 feet (30.5 m) using 12 ga. conductors, 10 Amps or less, 100 feet (30.5 m) using 14 ga. conductors.





;
, You should be aware of basic home safety methods and issues. Some of these include:


Smoke and/or fire alarms. If you use battery powered units, replace the batteries annually.
Carbon Monoxide detectors. Again, replace batteries annually.

, Injuries associated with tripping a falling in the home are common.

,, If you have difficulty or limited mobility, have grab bars installed in your bathtub. Also use an anti-slip bath mat in your tub or shower, and avoid products in the for bathing in glass containers.

,


Do not drop sharp knives or other objects in dirty dishwater.
Cover stove burners with burner covers when they are cooling after use.
Keep the floor and countertops clean.
Avoid or cleanup spills immediately to prevent slipping.

, These can result in serious medical conditions such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome requiring surgery to correct.

,


Use proper techniques when using a ladder. Basically, this means leaning the ladder away from the structure 1 foot (0.3 m) for each 4 feet (1.2 m) up you are going.
Never climb on an ice or snow covered roof.
Use the correct extension cords for outdoor lighting. They should be marked ""outdoor use"", and you should never overload them.
Keep extension cords out of walkways.

,, Here are a few examples, but basically, follow the rules, and stay within your physical limits.


Wear a helmet and other protective gear when required, whether cycling, playing football, or skateboarding. Make sure your helmet is designed for the sport you are participating in.
When cycling, always wear high visibility colors such as yellow. When cycling with limited sunlight, always wear reflective clothing.
Warm up prior to strenuous exercise, and cool down afterwards, to prevent muscle strain and tendon and ligament damage.
Use the correct footwear for each sporting activity.
Wear eye protection where appropriate.
Do not overdo it. When beginning a new exercise program, or starting a new sport, begin slowly.

, Never dive in shallow water, never swim alone, and use caution on slippery surfaces.

, Remember, even if you are going out for a moment, you may be sidetracked and end up staying out for hours, so if the sun is bright, put on a hat and use sunscreen or sunblock.

,


Buckle your seat belt.
Never drink and drive, or ride with someone who is or has been drinking.
Drive only when you have had sufficient rest.
Avoid driving in hazardous weather conditions, including snow, sleet, flooding rain, or fog.
Keep your car well maintained, with good brakes, safe tires, and a clean windshield.

, Because jobs encompass limitless hazards and conditions, this article will not attempt to cover them all.

Survey the scene and confirm the scene is safe.,
Approach and ask the victim permission for you to help them.

,
Determine the severity of the wound.

,
Take appropriate measures to avoid direct contact with bodily fluids.

,
Immediately cover the wound with a clean piece of gauze.,
Have the victim place their hand directly over the wound putting pressure on the gauze and holding it in place and elevate the wound above their heart.

,
Right after determining the presence of an emergency, call the Emergency Services.,
Continue to wrap gauze around the wound tightly and keep pressure directly over the wound if the wound has not stopped bleeding.

,
Do not remove any layers of gauze even if they become bled through-this could cause any formed clotting material to be destroyed.,
Do not remove any foreign objects.,
Know that if the bleeding continues, elevate the wound above the level of the heart and continue with direct pressure.

,
Stay with the victim until EMS arrives or a professional can take over.",How to Assist a Bleeding Victim in the Absence of EMS,";
,,,, If gauze is not available, use the next available clean material. A shirt or towel can work in this situation.

,, It is alright to leave the victim briefly in order to do so unless they are in immediate danger.

,, Place an additional layer of gauze or other material over the soaked dressing. If dressings become excessively bulky, remove a portion of the dressings, but DO NOT remove the ones closest to the skin.

, Wrap the gauze around the foreign objects.

,,


If ice is available, and the wound is life threatening, it can reduce bleeding. Ice will cause frostbite as well, so only use when pressure and elevation aren't enough.

Don't fall in!,
Swim with friends.,
Remain aware of your surroundings.,
Provide adult supervision to any children when around water.,
Be aware of your abilities, and the abilities of those you are swimming with.,
Avoid consumption of alcohol.,
Know the risk factors related to the environment you are swimming in.",How to Avoid Drowning1," Any body of water can have hazards associated with it, and it is important to keep track of your surroundings. If you do accidentally enter an aquatic environment keep these things in mind.


Stay calm. Suddenly falling into water will be a bit jarring, make sure you stay calm. Panicking will work against you restoring yourself to dry land.
Ask for assistance. Have someone throw you a float, a rope, or any assistive device available.
Tread water until you make it to the edge of the pool. (If you are not sure how to tread water try the instructions below.) When you reach the edge pull yourself out, or ask for assistance. If you fell into a lake or river tread water until you can stand in the shallows. Barring that, have someone throw you a float, and then assist you in recovering your position on the dock or boat.;
, One of the best ways to avoid getting into trouble is to swim with other people. This applies to all environments, either at home or in natural bodies of water. Swimming with companions allows for a much faster response rate if anyone gets into trouble.

, Be sure to keep track of everyone you are swimming with. If someone disappears they may need assistance; you should be ready to help as effectively as possible.

, Children can easily get into a situation they cannot get out of, so be sure to keep close watch over children when near water., Make sure that weak swimmers are provided with flotation devices. It is also important to know if any of your companions have a seizure disorder. A seizure while in the water can be very dangerous, and greatly increase the possibility of drowning.

, Be sure that anyone swimming is sober as the consumption of alcohol is a major risk factor in drownings. If you plan on consuming alcohol near a body of water take precautions to ensure safety such as wearing a life jacket or other appropriate flotation devices.

, Never dive into unfamiliar water. Light refracting through water can distort the location or appearance of rocks or shallow areas which can be serious hazards while diving. Always check on local conditions, high running water, riptides, and cold temperatures can be hazardous to the strongest swimmers."

See if you can determine what caused the injury to the person and if it is safe for you to approach. t doesn't help anyone to rush into a situation before the hazard has completely ended — you can't help the person if you fall victim to the same emergency, and emergency medical services (EMS) does not need to rescue two people instead of one.;
, These include: Slurred speech
A rapid heartbeat
Confusion
Dizziness
Lightheadedness
Suddenly being unable to respond coherently, or unable to respond at all

, A series of questions will immediately give you a lot of information regarding the person’s state. The questions should be easy while still requiring a level of basic cognition. Begin by asking the person if he’s all right to see if he’s responsive at all. If the person responds or even groans to show that he’s not unconscious, try asking:Can you tell me what year it is?
Can you tell me what month it is?
What day is it?
Who is the president?
Do you know where you are?
Do you know what happened?
If the person answers clearly and coherently, then he is displaying a high level of consciousness.
If the person responds but answers incorrectly to several of the first questions, then he’s conscious but showing signs of what is called an altered or changed mental state, which includes confusion and disorientation., If the person is conscious but showing signs of an altered mental state (such as being unable to clearly answer simple questions), then you should call 911 immediately. When you call 911, inform them of the patient's score on an AVPU scale:


A — Alert and oriented

V — Responds to Verbal stimuli

P — Responds to Painful stimuli

U — Unconscious/no response


Even if the person responds coherently to all of your questions and shows no signs of an altered mental state, you should still call 911 if the person:Has other injuries from the traumatic event
Feels chest pain or discomfort
Has a pounding or irregular heartbeat
Reports impairment to vision
Cannot move her arms or legs



, This is useful to see if you can gather any clues as to what caused the person to either pass out or have a diminishing level of consciousness. The person may or may not be able to answer any of these, depending upon his level of consciousness and how responsive he is. Try asking: Can you tell me what happened?
Are you on any medications?
Do you have diabetes? Have you ever experienced a diabetic coma?
Are you on any drugs or have you been drinking? (You may want to look around for any signs of needle marks on arms/feet or bottles of medication of alcohol nearby.)
Do you have a seizure disorder?
Do you have have a heart condition or have you ever had a heart attack?
Did you have chest pain or any other symptoms prior to going down?

, The person’s answers—whether logical or nonsense—will help the emergency responders determine the best course of action. Write everything down if you need to in order to pass along the information just as the person communicated it.


For instance, if the person has given incoherent answers to most of your questions but also communicated that she has a seizure disorder, then she may continue answering questions incorrectly for five to ten minutes in the post-seizure phase of the disorder, yet she may require little more than a brief period of observation from paramedics.
As another example, if the person has confirmed that she is diabetic, then the emergency responder will know to immediately check her glucose levels when you pass along that information.

, If the person has provided incoherent answers to all of your questions—or if he’s given logical answers but seems on the verge of nodding off—then do what you can to keep the person talking to you. Emergency responders will have a much easier time assessing the situation if the person is conscious when they arrive. Ask the person if he can keep his eyes open for you, and ask him additional questions that encourage him to keep talking.

, If you know the person or witnessed her ""pass out,"" you may be able to provide emergency medical staff with clues as to the diagnosis or ""cause"" of unconsciousness. Common causes of diminished consciousness or loss of consciousness include: Severe blood loss
Severe injury to the head or chest
Drug overdose
Alcohol intoxication
A car accident or other major injury
Blood sugar problems (as in diabetics)
Heart problems
Low blood pressure (common in the elderly, but they usually regain consciousness shortly thereafter)
Dehydration
Seizure
Stroke
Hyperventilating

, In the event of many medical conditions—such as diabetes—the person may wear something like this to inform the condition to responders.If you find one, report it immediately to emergency medical personnel when they arrive.

, It is important to have someone watching over the patient at all times. If he remains semi-conscious and appears to be breathing and not in any distress, continue to watch him until medical staff arrive.
If the person becomes totally unresponsive, the situation is much more serious and you will need to assess him further and proceed with the steps below.

, Try yelling, ""Are you okay?"" and shake the person gently. This may be all it takes to bring the person back to consciousness.

, If the person is unresponsive to your questions, but you are not sure whether she is ""unconscious"" to the degree that requires CPR, then you should administer a painful stimulus to see if it produces a conscious reaction.The most common form of this is a ""sternal rub,"" which entails making a fist and using your knuckles to rub vigorously into the person's sternum or breastbone. If the person responds to ""pain"" — to this sensation — you can continue to monitor her without CPR as this is a sign that she is okay for the moment. (If she does not respond to pain, however, you will likely need to proceed to CPR.)
If you fear the person otherwise has a chest injury from the trauma, other methods of testing her pain response include pinching the person’s fingernail or nail bed or pinching the person’s trapezius muscle (back of the neck). The pinch should be very hard and directly to the muscle.If the person responds to the pain by either curling all her limbs in or out, this is referred to as posturing and could be indicative of spinal injury.

, You likely have already done this, but especially if the person is unresponsive to pain, you need to make sure that an ambulance is on the way. Remain on the line with the operator, or if someone else is there, hand the phone to him so he can receive further instruction.

, If the person is unconscious but breathing, then you may not have to perform CPR, especially if no one around is certified in the practice. Be sure to keep a constant watch on the rise and fall of the person’s chest to ensure that he’s still breathing.
If you cannot tell by watching alone, you can place your ear near his mouth or nose and listen for breath sounds. When you listen at someone's mouth, point your head down his body to the chest and watch his chest rise and fall at the same time. This is the easiest way to see breathing.
Note that if you have any reason to suspect a spinal injury but the person is breathing, then do not try to reposition him unless he vomits. In this case, roll his entire body to the side while supporting his neck and back to keep them in the same position.If you have no reason to suspect a spinal injury, then roll the person onto his side, position his top leg so that both his hip and knee are at a 90° angle (to stabilize him on his side), and then softly tilt his head back to help keep his airway open.This is called the ""recovery position"" and is the safest for the patient to be in, in case he vomits at any point.

, You can check the person's pulse on the underside of her wrist on the thumb side — called the ""radial pulse,"" or by gently feeling one side of her neck about an inch below her ear — called the ""carotid pulse."" Always check the carotid pulse on the same side of the body on which you are sitting. Reaching across the neck of a patient for her pulse can cause panic if she wakes up.


If a pulse is absent at any point, and especially if there is no breathing, now is the time to start CPR if you are trained; if not, follow instructions of emergency medical personnel over the telephone. If you accidentally hung up after initially calling them, you can call back at this point for further instructions. They are trained to provide instructions for laypeople over the phone.

, Cardiac arrest is one of the most common reasons for a person to collapse and become unresponsive for no other obvious reason, such as due to a car accident. Providing CPR (if necessary) while waiting for the arrival of paramedics can double or even triple a person’s chance of survival in the event of cardiac arrest.Find out if anyone in the immediate vicinity is CPR certified.

, If the person isn’t breathing or has stopped breathing, then the first step is to check his airway. Place one hand on his forehead and the other underneath his jaw. With the forehead hand, slide his head backward and tilt his jaw with the other. Watch for any signs of his chest beginning to rise and fall. Place your ear over his mouth and feel for any breath on your face.


If you can easily see something in his airway when you look into his mouth, then try to remove it, but only if the object is loose. If the object is clearly lodged, then do not try to remove it from his throat since you may inadvertently push the object farther down his airway.The reason we check the airway first is that if there is a blockage (or an obstruction, such as often happens in choking victims), and if we can easily remove it, our problem is solved.
However, if there is not, check for a pulse and, if there is no pulse (or if you cannot find one and are in doubt), immediately begin chest compressions.
Head-tilt chin-lifts should not be done on skull, spine, neck injuries. Instead, use the jaw-thrust method, in which you kneel above the person's head and place your hands on either side of his head. Place your middle and index finger along his jaw bone and gently push it upward so that the jaw is jutting forward, as though he has an underbite.

, Current CPR standards place the emphasis on chest compressions with a ratio of thirty compressions for every two rescue breaths.Begin chest compressions by:Placing the heel of your hand on the person’s breastbone directly between his nipples
Placing the heel of your opposite hand over the top of the first
Positioning your body mass directly over your positioned hands
Compressing hard and fast downward approximately two inches into his chest
Allowing his chest to rise completely
Repeating to a count of thirty
At this point, add in the two rescue breaths if you are trained in CPR. If you are not, continue with compressions and ignore the breaths as they are much less important.

, You can stop performing CPR as soon as the person shows signs of breathing on his own.Watch for the rise and fall of the person’s chest and place your ear near his mouth to check if he’s breathing on his own.

, If the person continues to show no signs of consciousness or breathing on his own, then keep performing CPR at a rate of two rescue breaths to every thirty chest compressions until emergency responders arrive."

Keep your hands and arms in the water.,
Move your cupped hands through the water to push you toward the surface.,
Keeping your legs at a normal gait, and move them in a scissor motion.,
Breath in easy regular breaths.,
Continue this pattern of arm and feet movement until assistance is provided.",How to Avoid Drowning2," Do not raise your hands and do not flail. Keeping your arms in the water displaces more liquid, and makes you more buoyant.

, Cupping your hands allows you to deliver more force in each stroke. Pushing downward with your cupped hands will move your shoulders and head above the surface of the water.

, This pushes water underneath you, and will keep you on the surface. The closer your legs are together the more water they will displace, but you want to keep them just far enough to not knock into each other. Think about a typical walking motion, and that will provide a good gauge. Kicking will also prevent your arms from tiring.


Ideally you will use your hands and arms together, but that will take some coordination and practice. You can alternate between the two while you get used to the motions. Alternating kicking and pushing with your arms will allow you to stay buoyant for a longer period.

, Keeping air in your lungs will make you more buoyant and less likely to slip beneath the surface. Feeling like you could drown is a frightening experience, and can make you want to breath rapidly or hold your breath, but it is important to remain calm. Avoiding hyperventilation and loss of oxygen will help you get back out of the water.

, Let someone know you are in trouble, but stay calm as you wait for assistance."

Install barriers around your pool.,
Remove all toys from the pool area.,
Learn to swim.,
Provide flotation devices for any inexperienced or weak swimmers.,
Maintain all drain covers on your pool.",How to Avoid Drowning3," This will prevent children from entering the water without supervision. Children are at an increased risk around home pools, and it is important that they are not allowed easy or unsupervised access.

, Anything that might tempt a child to enter the water without supervision is dangerous. Toys can be especially alluring to kids, and need to be put away after use., Most local branches of the Red Cross or YMCA will offer a variety of swimming lessons for all ages, and levels of ability. This can be a very important safeguard before installing or moving into a home with a pool. , A bit of prevention is worth much more than a dramatic rescue. If you have young children, or are expecting young children to be using your pool provide age appropriate flotation devices.

, Improperly maintained covers can create suction that will hold a swimmer or child under the water. "

Know your environment.,
Swim in front of a lifeguard.,
Watch out for riptides.,
Enter fresh water lakes and rivers feet first.,
Never swim in a high running current.",How to Avoid Drowning4," Swimming in natural bodies of water can be fun, but present their own risks.Know what the greatest risks are for the area you are swimming in.

, If it is available always swim with a lifeguard present. They are trained to look for danger and provide assistance.

, If you are swimming in the ocean these can be very serious threats. Riptides form when part of the sandbar gives way and water rushes out into the ocean. If you are caught in a riptide swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the pull of the riptide, and then swim diagonally to shore.

, It will prevent head injuries due to unseen rocks or hazards. You should also test the water's temperature before entering. Even on a warm day a deep lake can be cold enough to induce hypothermia., Moving water has a remarkable ability to overwhelm even the strongest swimmer. If a river appears to be running quickly you need to be very cautious about entering as the current could easily present a hazard.


If you find yourself in a fast moving current, float on your back with your feet pointing downstream, and your head pointing up stream. Your feet will absorb any impacts from unexpected obstacles. When the current slows down , swim diagonally to shore."

Prepare for car repairs


Include foam sealant or a battery-powered air compressor in your desert roadside kit.,
Stay hydrated


The temperature of the desert will be one of your worst enemies if you get stranded in a roadside emergency.,
Make mylar a must

Carry extra clothes


Keep a hat, extra shirts and long, loose-fitting pants in your desert kit.,
Include a compass


Store a compass in your emergency roadside kit and make sure you know how to use it.",How to Assemble an Emergency Roadside Kit for a Desert Climate," These will aid in a quick repair in case of a flat tire. Also store an extra jug of coolant in case your car overheats. Carry jumper cables and a tire jack in your car trunk at all times.;
, Make sure your desert roadside emergency kit includes several bottles of water. Pack enough water to provide yourself with a gallon of water per day in the event that you get stranded for a long period or have to walk to get help. Consider investing in a large jerrycan to carry water; this will be more convenient than carrying several small water bottles if you have to leave your vehicle.

, This blanket will work with your body's temperature and help you stay cool. If you can find any other shade nearby to help you stay out of the sun, you can use the blanket to utilize the shade under your car to avoid overheating or sunstroke.

, Make sure yours includes first aid basics like bandages, gauze, alcohol, burn ointment, latex or vinyl gloves, scissors, tweezers, medical tape, splints, and antiseptic liquid or swabs. Your desert-specific kit should also include glucose tablets to help regulate blood sugar and a snakebite treatment kit.

, It's important to keep your body covered, especially your head and neck, to prevent sunburn, sun poisoning, heatstroke and dehydration. These pieces of clothing will keep you covered from the sun, but still as cool as possible.

, It will help you navigate in case you need to walk for help. Don't rely on a cell phone or GPS unit; they might not work in a desert emergency, because there might not be a local signal. A compass and some basic orienteering skills will be much more useful in the desert.

Talk to your doctor.,
Obtain a prescription for lower doses.,
Follow a schedule.,
Take other medication.,
Let it go.,
Prepare for withdrawal.,
Look out for side effects.",How to Get off Fentanyl Patches1," Fentanyl is a powerful drug, and coming off of it takes time and support. If you have been using fentanyl regularly, do not attempt to get off fentanyl on your own, as you may experience serious withdrawal side effects.Your doctor will come up with a schedule for you to gradually decrease your dosage.;
, Your doctor will prescribe you patches in lower doses than the patches you have. Use these patches. Do not attempt to lower your dose by cutting your patches in halves or quarters. Fentanyl patches may release their medicine faster when cut, which could cause overdose and heart failure.Almost all fentanyl patches are ""reservoir"" patches, meaning the medication is pooled inside and will release quickly when the patch is cut.
Do not cut matrix system patches. Some users believe it can be done, but the manufacturer warns against it, and no studies recommend it.Cutting a patch may also damage its sticking power, which could cause it to come off while you sleep and interfere with its effectiveness.

, Your doctor will likely give you a schedule that cuts your dosage over time. This may take weeks or months, depending on the nature of your pain and the length of your fentanyl usage. For example, if you take a 50mcg patch, you might switch to a 25mcg after two weeks, then a 12mcg two weeks later.

, Your doctor may prescribe you other medication to help you come down from fentanyl. This might be pain medication to help with breakout pain, such as Vicodin. You might also be prescribed anti-anxiety medication to help control shaking and other withdrawal symptoms. Use these as prescribed.

, When you apply your last 12mcg patch, leave it on until it falls off. Even if you've been changing them every 72 hours, leave the very last patch on until it comes off on its own. Because the medicine is weakest when your patch is oldest, it will let you down more gently than if you were to suddenly remove the patch.

, Fentanyl is physically addictive, and can become psychologically addictive. Prepare for serious withdrawal symptoms as you reduce your dose. Take time off from work if you are employed. The first 48 hours after the fentanyl leaves your system are the worst, and that after that time the withdrawal will have peaked and symptoms will begin to subside. Make sure you have your doctor's number on hand so you can consult with her if any symptoms begin to worry you.


Prepare a comfortable nest for yourself for the worst of it. Launder your softest clothing, rent movies, and prepare the foods that you can eat even when you are nauseated from pain.
Have friends and family around for support if possible.
Go online and join a forum for current and former fentanyl patients. Forums with users across the globe are a great resource for sleepless nights brought on by withdrawal.
As the withdrawal symptoms lessen, light exercise will help keep you centered. Take a walk around the block. Do yoga exercises or stretch at home, or in class if you feel up to it.

, If you experience worrisome side effects after you are off fentanyl, contact your doctor immediately. Hallucinations, chest pain, fainting, mood swings, difficulty walking, speaking, or urinating, rapid weight gain, and spitting blood are all considered worrisome symptoms. If you think you may have had a seizure, call an ambulance and go immediately to urgent care.Other side effects may include increased sweating, increased heart rate, anxiety, restlessness, and stomach pain.

Programs are still controversial, and marijuana is still classified federally as a Class 1 Drug. If you're interested in using marijuana to treat your condition, find out the laws in your state regarding use by clicking here. States with medical marijuana programs in place include:


West Coast: Arizona, Colorado, California, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington
East Coast: Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maine, and Maryland
Midwest: Michigan, Minnesota, and Illinois
Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia;
, You won’t qualify for medical marijuana because you want to use it recreationally, even if recreational use is one of your goals. In most states, medical marijuana is only available to patients with pre-approved conditions, while other states, including California, make medical marijuana more widely available for a variety of conditions.In general, universal pre-approved conditions include:


Chronic and severe pain, including pain from arthritis, migraine headaches, and Crohn’s disease
AIDS
Chemo-related nausea
Hepatitis C
Multiple Sclerosis
Asthma
Epilepsy
Alzheimer’s Disease
Any terminal illness

, Without a severe illness, most general practitioners will not recommend the use of medical marijuana, unprompted. Talk to your doctor about whether or not using marijuana might be right for your conditions and concerns and discuss your specific conditions that you think might be aided by medical marijuana.


Often, medical marijuana will be recommended as an alternative to more traditional forms of medication. If you've been on other medicines and they haven't helped, this can be a good in-road to talking about medical marijuana with your doctor.
Likewise, if you're feeling frustrated with nausea, sleeplessness, or other side-effects as a result of any medications that you're taking, medical marijuana can be an appropriate supplement to other prescriptions that you might be taking.

, Your general practitioner is the best doctor to talk to about any prescription, but many are hesitant to recommend the use of medical marijuana. Often called “420 doctors” or “pot docs,” entrepreneurial doctors in many states with medical programs are available for a consultation fee and few questions asked. If you’re interested in using medical marijuana to relieve things like writers’ cramp and insomnia, say, a 420 doctor is probably the place to go.

, Make an appointment with your doctor or with a doctor who specializes in medical marijuana, and discuss your ailments and your desire to explore medical marijuana. You should walk out with a prescription in hand, which you can use to register as a user with the state and make your purchase from the dispensary.


Prescriptions and recommendations are legally protected under patient confidentiality laws. This doctor's recommendation will not be available to potential employers, law enforcement, and other inquiries., Depending on what state you live in, registering as a medical marijuana user with the state may be mandatory or voluntary, but it’s important to understand the difference and the way in which registration can protect you legally. The purpose of the card is to identify you to vendors and law enforcement as a registered and legal user of medical marijuana.


In California and Maine, patient ID cards are voluntary, meaning that you can take your prescription directly from your doctor to a dispensary, provided you've got a valid state ID. Without a Patient ID card, however, police have no indication that you’re a ""legal"" user, making arrests (if not convictions) somewhat more likely.
Nevada, New Hampshire, Maine, Michigan, and Rhode Island will also allow you to purchase medicine if you’ve got a state-issued card from any state, meaning that you’ll also have the option of procuring medicine in multiple states, if you go through the registration process in your own state.

, Many users are concerned that registering as a marijuana user with the state will open them up to prosecution by the DEA, or will affect future employment in other states. Most states have privacy safeguards in place, retaining nothing in the database but a randomized ID number and a photo of the registrant. The DEA has announced publicly that it has no interest in pursuing individual users of medical marijuana.For the most part, passing drug tests will be more important to your ability to secure future employment. While the legality of medicinal marijuana is in a complicated gray area, registration should in no way affect your future employment.

, In most states, you'll register for your medical marijuana ID card at the office of the department of public health in your county, and you'll need to register and fill out the paperwork in person. You'll need to bring a state-issued form of identification, like a driver's license, as well as your doctor's recommendation.


To apply, you'll need to be able to prove that you're a resident in the state and county in which you're applying. If you don't have a valid state-issued ID, you can still apply, provided you've got some form of identification that's up-to-date and legal in another state. You can use bills, leases, or other documents to prove your residency in the state.

, Fill out the paperwork in person and submit it to the department of public health. In most states, there should be a waiting period and a fee associated with the application, usually somewhere in the neighborhood of $50. More specifically, you can find out the requirements for your state by visiting the website of the department of public health or visiting in person.

, When you visit a dispensary, when you talk to your doctor, and anytime you’re talking about your purchases, it’s a good idea to get in the habit of referring to it as medicine, not “weed” or “pot” or other slang terms. This is the approved dispensary term.


Medical marijuana activists have done lots of work to change the vocabulary and the connotations with marijuana. The more you work to refer to it as medicine, the more it will be accepted as medicine. Calling it ""pot"" reinforces the stigma that you're using recreational drugs, not legal medicine.

, Most dispensaries are cooperative organizations registered with the state to provide high-quality plants and medicine to registered patients. After receiving a doctor's recommendation and a state-issued ID card, you can visit the dispensary closest to you to become a member and make your purchases. Often, dispensaries will also provide you with a membership card, making it easy to recognize you as a registered patient.

, There are many ways of consuming medical marijuana, and some may be more appropriate than others, depending on your needs and your conditions. Getting informed about the different products and techniques will help make the dispensary less intimidating.Combustible flowers, oils, and concentrates are consumed in the traditional way, by smoking. Many dispensaries will offer pre-rolled cigarettes and different strains of loose marijuana flowers at a variety of price-points.
Non-combustible hardware like vaporizers are also available at many dispensaries, for patients interested in healthier smoking options. Non-combustible consumption means that the THC–the active ingredient in marijuana–is vaporized and inhaled, without the harmful carcinogens from the smoke.
Edibles, tinctures, and drinks are extremely user-friendly. You can buy cookies, brownies, and drinkable THC-infused products to medicate your condition. If you're not a fan of smoking marijuana, this is the best option for most users.
Topical sprays, creams, and analgesics are also available in some dispensaries. These localize THC that can be absorbed through the skin for topical pain-relief treatments.

, Many dispensaries also sell plant-starts and seeds for use in home cultivation. Registering as a patient also allows you to grow a small amount of marijuana for your own consumption, so if you live in a rural area without easy access to a dispensary, this option may be better for you. Depending on what state you live in, the amount of plants you’re able to grow will vary, but it’s usually considerable.

, Medical marijuana users are in a somewhat strange position of being permitted to do something in the state that's illegal at the federal level, so it's especially important to know your rights and your responsibilities when it comes to using medicine.


Your records as a registered user of medical marijuana fall under patient confidentiality and customer confidentiality laws in most states, and it's illegal for employees to consult the data found in your ""file."" There should be no connection between your driver's license and your SSN and your medical marijuana registration.If you're pulled over, you do not need to present your medical marijuana ID card preemptively, unless you're being cited for a marijuana-related offense. You do not need to permit a search without probable cause.
Patient-confidentiality laws guarantee that doctor's recommendations will be kept private from all law enforcement inquiries. The fact that you've been recommended to use a legal drug by a medical professional is no one's business but your own.

, Even if it's legal, strictly speaking, you still need to take a lot of responsibility to keep yourself safe. Use your medicine in private, never smoke in areas where smoking is prohibited, and


Don't take medical marijuana across state lines, especially into states without medical marijuana programs in place. Any time you're transporting cannabis, keep your medical ID card handy and never ever smoke while you're driving. Keep medical marijuana in airtight containers and in the trunk. The smell of marijuana counts as probable cause for search.
THC stays in your system for days after use, meaning that other traffic infractions can carry with it an added ""operating while intoxicated"" charge, even if you're no longer ""high."" Never drive after smoking marijuana. Treat your medical marijuana use the same as you might treat the consumption of alcohol or other prescription drugs. Do it in the safety of your own home."

Talk to your doctor.,
Wait till the medicine is in your home.,
Remove the patch.,
Phase in your new medication.,
Follow up.",How to Get off Fentanyl Patches2," If you do not like your patch and would like to use a different method of pain management, talk to your doctor about switching you to a different pain medication. If you would like to switch to a lower dose, your doctor might choose to switch you to an equivalent amount of a new opioid, then wean you off of that.


Depending on the type of pain you are in, the side effects you want to avoid, and the medications covered by your insurance, your doctor will advise you on the right alternative and devise a conversion plan.
Your doctor might want to switch you to oral morphine, oxycodone, or methadone.
Do not switch medications or stop taking your medication before consulting your doctor.

, When your doctor prescribes a new medicine, he may advise you to start cutting your dose of fentanyl. Make sure you do not begin decreasing your dose until your replacement medication has arrived in your home. A prescription does not guarantee delivery. You will put yourself at risk of pain if you cut your fentanyl dosage and your new medicine does not arrive on time., When the medicine is in your home, and your doctor has given you the order, remove your patch. Dispose of it safely as you always do. Your doctor may advise you to wait until you have worn through your current patch and it comes off. She may also advise you not to wait. Follow your doctor's orders as to timing.

, When you remove the patch, the fentanyl will still be in your system, so you won't need as much of your new medication at first. Your doctor will prescribe you a ""rescue"" opioid for the first 12 hours after your patch is removed. After this 12 hours, you will likely be told to begin taking 50% of your new dose. After 24 hours, you will start taking 100% of your new dose.


After the first 12 hours, you can still take your ""rescue"" opioid if you experience a pain crisis.

, Schedule a follow up appointment with your doctor before you have been off of your patch for a week. Your new medication may take a while to start working, or it may work well at first and then cease to be effective. Ensure that you have a means to get to the hospital if you experience a crisis your rescue opioid cannot cover.


If you find you have become addicted to your fentanyl patch, consider entering a rehabilitation program.
Prepare for withdrawal. Even using new medication, you may experience withdrawal symptoms. Take time off to get used to your new medication, and rally family and friend support.

Recognize an addiction.,
Get inpatient care.,
Get outpatient care.,
Take methadone or buprenorphine.,
Find affordable rehab.",How to Get off Fentanyl Patches3," Fentanyl is highly addictive. If you are using your prescription after your doctor has recommended you stop, or making the unsupported decision to increase your dosage, ask yourself if you are addicted. If you find yourself concealing your fentanyl use or otherwise acting surreptitiously or dishonestly to be able to obtain or use fentanyl, you may be addicted. If you are consuming fentanyl that you obtain from someone other than your doctor, you are likely addicted.


Fentanyl is often stolen from hospitals, pharmacies, and nursing homes.On the street, fentanyl is known as ""rizzle,"" ""gems,"" ""china,"" ""dance fever,"" ""goodfella,"" ""china girl,"" ""TNT,"" ""tango,"" ""apache"" and other names. It is sold by itself or mixed with other drugs.
If you find yourself buying fentanyl from dealers, consider visiting a detox center.

, Check into an inpatient facility for an immersive rehabilitation experience. In an inpatient facility, you will be in the company of other patients. You will have access to therapists and round-the-clock care. Your length of stay depends on your needs. After your detoxification, which may last a week, you can stay for anywhere from three weeks to three months.Supervised detoxification is safer than unsupervised detoxification, and your doctor may recommend it.
Inpatient care is a great option for patients whose home life is either unstable or distracting.
Consider joining a meet-up group or checking into an outpatient program to prevent relapse after completing inpatient therapy.

, There are several kinds of outpatient programs to choose from. ""Intensive programs"" meet several times a week for several hours a session and focus on preventing relapse. ""Partial hospitalization"" will have you visiting a hospital for several hours a day three to five days a week. Therapy and 12-step programs such as Narcotics Anonymous are also considered outpatient treatment.If you cannot afford inpatient care or to take time off work, consider outpatient care.
If you need continuing care after kicking an addiction, consider outpatient care.
If your home life is stable and supportive, and you feel you need the continuing support of your friends and family to commit to rehabilitation, consider outpatient care.

, Talk to your doctor or a rehabilitation specialist about taking methadone or buprenorphine to ease your addiction. Locate a methadone or buprenorphine center near you and ask for a clinical evaluation. If you have been using opioids such as fentanyl for a long time, methadone might be more effective than buprenorphine., Many rehabilitation centers are government funded or nonprofit. They may offer their services for free, or charge on a sliding scale based on your income. Almost all rehabilitation centers offer some amount of financial assistance. Outpatient care and methadone or buprenorphine treatments may be more affordable than inpatient programs.To find free or low-cost rehabilitation in the United States, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.


You can also look up local treatment centers with the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator on their website.
You can also use their website to locate centers near you that dispense methadone and buprenorphine.

Check the CSM (Color, Sensation, and Movement) of an injured person before and after splinting.,
Get creative to find supplies.,
Move the injured limb as little as possible.,
Place the splint to minimize movement of the injured area.,
Pad the area between the injured limb and the splint.,
Apply the splint to one side of the injury.Use your rigid object to brace the injured limb.,
Tie the splint to keep it in place.,
Use a SAM splint, if available.",How to Apply Splints1," When dealing with emergency injuries, such as a broken leg, you can prevent complications by checking for “CSM” before splinting and regularly afterwards until you get the injured person to a hospital.Watch for changes that happen after the splint is applied – that’s one way to know the splint is too tight, or is otherwise causing problems. Checking the CSM before splinting gives you a baseline, and information to tell emergency services.



Color: Watch for reddening or paling of the injured extremity. If fingers or toes turn white, it means blood flow is restricted. Loosen or remove splinting right away to prevent serious complications.

Sensation: Check the injured person’s ability to feel sensations to make sure they’re not having nerve problems. Have them close their eyes or look away, and touch each toe or finger of the affected limb. Use firm pressure with your thumb and ask them to tell you when you’re touching them. Then check for sharp sensation by applying pressure to each digit with a pin or sharp stick.

Movement: A splint should immobilize a limb, but not prevent movement entirely. If the person loses ability to move a limb once a splint is applied, it could mean that swelling is causing the splint and wrap to be too tight. Remove the splint quickly.;
, You can splint a limb with any strong, straight object you can find. Find a stick, plank, or small log, or roll up a newspaper or towel to use as a splint. Shoelaces, ropes, belts, strips of clothing, or even vines can be used to hold the splint in place. Use excess clothing for padding.If you’re using anything from nature that can splinter, wrap it in clothing first.

, Moving an injured limb can cause further damage. Move the limb as little – and as gently – as possible to get it into a position in which you can splint it. Preferably, do not move it at all and apply the splint the best you can in the limb’s current position., In an emergency, you do not have to know the exact right way to splint an injured joint. Try to minimize movement of the affected joint or limb. The best way to do this is to apply a splint to the joint both above and below the injury.For instance, if the forearm is injured, apply a splint that extends from above the elbow to below the wrist. Secure the splint just below the wrist and above the elbow for best support.


If the elbow or shoulder is injured, tuck the arm close to the body and wrap the whole torso, immobilizing the limb against the body.
If one leg is severely injured and you will be able to carry the victim, splint the injured leg to the uninjured leg.

, Use something for padding such as clothes. Gently wrap the injured area in padding, but do not pull the wrap too tight. Provide cushioning between the person’s skin and the splint without interfering with blood circulation., If there is an open wound or if bone is protruding from the skin, put the splint on the uninjured side of the limb, if possible.

, Tie or tape the splint in place on both ends of the splint. Brace the splint on the outsides of the two joints surrounding the injury.This provides the best support. For instance, tie the splint below the ankle and above the knee for leg injuries.


If using tape, try to tape over the padding and not directly on the person’s skin.
Try not to tie or tape something directly over the injury.

, A good outdoors first-aid kit can include a SAM splint, a moldable aluminum strip between two layers of padding that hardens once put into position. They are small, inexpensive, and light-weight, and can be a good temporizing measure in an emergency; though they do not provide much support. If using a SAM splint, follow these general guidelines:Mold the splint on someone of similar size and shape to the injured person, not directly on the injured person. Once the splint is shaped, apply it to the injured person and hold it in place with anything you have: a sock, torn shirt, tape, cling film, or elastic bandages.
Do not wrap the splint too tightly; it should be snug, but allow room for swelling.

Do not quit Suboxone cold turkey.,
Talk to a doctor about how to best taper off Suboxone.,
Prepare for withdrawal symptoms.",How to Get off Suboxone1," Suboxone has a long half life. A half-life is the amount of time it takes for a substance to deplete to half its value and Suboxone's half-life is 37 hours. This means some traces of the substance stays in your system for over two days after your last dose. Despite this, quitting cold turkey is not recommended. You could end up causing yourself unnecessary physical and emotional pain.


Quitting cold turkey may not be safe and the withdrawal symptoms, such as body aches and dizziness, will be much more severe if you simply stop using the drug suddenly. Relapse is far more likely if you attempt to quit cold turkey.Remember, you should not detox from Suboxone until you have the other opiate addiction for which Suboxone was recommended under control. You should also wait until you are in a stress-free environment. You do not want quitting Suboxone to lead to a relapse of heroin or another powerful narcotic.;
, Never stop taking Suboxone without consulting a physician first. You need to figure out a safe and effective method of detox that minimizes withdrawal and the likelihood of relapse.


Talk to a physician who knows your full medical history including your history of drug use. Only they can tell you what's safe for you. You can also check into a rehab or detox facility where on-staff physicians have experience treating addiction and can provide you medical support during the process of quitting.Most doctors recommend reducing your dosage by 20% to 25% every 24 to 48 hours. A medication to control heart rate and blood pressure will be prescribed. In addition, medications to treat the nausea, diarrhea, sleeplessness, and cramping will also be recommended., Withdrawal symptoms will not be as harsh for Suboxone as they might be for other narcotics like heroin; however, you should expect to experience some symptoms of withdrawal as you begin the process of quitting.


Common withdrawal symptoms include dizziness, confusion, headaches, nausea, stomach pain, sleep disturbances, and liver damage. You should regularly see a physician throughout the entire process of quitting to monitor your health during withdrawal.The severity of withdrawal symptoms depend on a number of things. The longer you've been taking Suboxone, the harsher the withdrawal process. If you were taking it in higher dosages, you will also probably have harder symptoms.An individual's personal physiology also plays a big role. Some people simply tolerate symptoms better than others and may experience less pain. Also, some people have higher tolerance for pain than others.Support is important during the withdrawal period. If you're really struggling, it is strongly recommended you check into a rehabilitation facility so you can be safely monitored by doctors and therapists to help you throughout your journey."

Size up the scene.,
Obtain consent before providing care.,
Evaluate vital functions.,
Check the airway.,
Assess breathing.,
Assess circulation.,
Call for help.",How to Apply First Aid without Bandages1," While you may be eager to help the injured person, you will be of no help if you, too, become injured. Before approaching the person, make sure there are no hazards, such as traffic, unstable structures, downed electrical lines, swift-moving water, violence, explosions or toxic gas exposure.If the hazards are still present and it is too dangerous for you to reach the person, call for help and keep yourself out of harm's way.If the hazard is not a threat to your safety, then you should approach the injured person.


Another way you need to protect yourself is to wear any personal protective equipment you may have access to, such as gloves to protect you from bloodborne disease if the person is bleeding.;
, You must attempt to get the injured person's consent before you can begin first aid. The person must give verbal consent or consent with a gesture. You should identify yourself, indicate your level of training, and ask the person if you may provide first aid.If the person is unconscious, confused, mentally impaired, seriously injured or seriously ill, then consent is implied and you may assist the person.If the injured person is a minor, you must obtain consent from his parent or guardian. If this person is not available and the situation is life-threatening then consent is implied and you may assist the child.If the person refuses aid, you must respect this. Even if the person is seriously injured and the situation is life-threatening, if he refuses care you cannot attempt first aid., These include assessing the victim's ABCs: Airway, Breathing and Circulation. Lie the person on his back and put yourself close to his head and neck so you can better evaluate his vital functions.If the person is conscious, begin working but also talk with him to keep him calm and help slow his heart rate. If possible, try to keep the victim's eyes averted so he cannot see the wound.

, If the person is unconscious and there is no possibility of neck or spine injury, place one hand on the person's forehead and another underneath his chin. Put gentle pressure on the forehead with one hand and gently tilt his chin up toward the sky with the other hand to open the airway. Make sure the person's airway remains open;check inside the mouth for obstructions.


If the person is conscious, he may be able to indicate to you whether their airway is blocked.
If you suspect a neck or spine injury, use the jaw-thrust method, in which you grab the patient's jaw on either side and pull it forward, opening the airway without compromising the neck or spine.

, Look for a rise in the chest area; listen for the sound of air coming in and out of the lungs; feel for air by hovering the side of your face just above the person's mouth.If your casualty is unconscious but breathing normally, he should be placed in the recovery position, on his side with the head tilted back and the hand further away from the ground under the head and the arm closet to the ground either bent or straight out. The leg further away from the ground (the top leg) should be bent for stability and to keep the victim from rolling forward. Do not put someone in the recovery position if you suspect he has a spinal injury. Monitor the person's breathing.Check for signs of a pulse. You do not need to measure the pulse, only detect it. You can quickly feel for a pulse by placing two fingers on the person's throat, in the hollow area just beside the windpipe.Apply gentle pressure.
If the victim is not breathing, do CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Note that the recommended method for performing CPR has changed in recent years; research suggests that compression-only CPR (no mouth-to-mouth breathing) is as effective as the traditional approach (which had included mouth-to-mouth breathing).To prepare for an emergency, it is strongly recommended you attend a CPR training class to learn the proper procedure to administer CPR and get some practice.
Be aware that CPR is not pretty. The chest compressions often break ribs. Prepare yourself for this possibility.

, Look for signs of severe bleeding once the other vitals have been evaluated. Once you know the person is breathing, you can then move onto treating any open wounds by applying pressure and raising the affected area above heart level. See Part 3 on this.Watch for signs of shock. Keep the victim warm and comfortable. Both shock and loss of blood can cause the victim to suffer from lowered body temperature. Throw a blanket, coat, or some other warm item over the victim to keep him warm.Keep the victim as still as possible. Whether lying or sitting down, the person should be kept still and calm.

, Once the person is stabilized, call for emergency help immediately. If the person is bleeding out , get someone else to call emergency services while you help the victim.For this to be effective, you must ask one person specifically to call emergency services. Do not shout this at a crowd of people — select one person and say, ""You! Man in the Hawaiian shirt! Call 911!""


If you are the only person around, use your phone to call for assistance. If you don't have a phone with you, look for a passersby or a place that may have a phone.

Get a second opinion when necessary.",How to Get Antidepressants1," A psychiatrist or family physician can perform an examination and speak with you about why you feel you might need antidepressants to treat your health condition. In most cases, meeting with a psychiatrist is considered ideal since psychiatrists specialize in mental health disorders, have more experience working with antidepressants, and can prescribe the antidepressants that will work best for you.Research local psychiatrists who are covered under your insurance plan and set up an appointment by phone or online.
Find a psychiatrist using a site like ZocDoc or Thero.org.;
, Providing as many details as possible can give your doctor the insight needed to correctly diagnose your disorder and prescribe the right type of antidepressant. For example, those diagnosed with bipolar disorder may need two different medications to manage manic and depressive phases, but someone with anxiety disorder may need one specific type.

Mention physical symptoms of depression such as insomnia and lack of energy, as well as mental symptoms such as sadness or feelings of helplessness.

, Identifying the cause of your stress and depression can help your doctor properly diagnose and treat your condition and prescribe the right type of medication. Be honest with your doctor when asked if there are any stressors in your life.

For instance, perhaps you are in a toxic relationship currently that has caused you to become depressed. Mention this to your doctor.

, In most cases, individuals who’ve been experiencing long-term stress are the best candidates for antidepressants. Those experiencing short-term stress or depression due to being separated from a partner or laid off from work may not be considered ideal candidates.

, Let them know of any medications that you’re currently on, including vitamins and birth control. This can help your doctor better understand which treatments may or may not work to help improve your condition. For example, inform your doctor of any drugs or medications you’ve taken in an attempt to treat depression, and whether you’ve been exercising more frequently or eating healthier foods to improve your condition.


Some of the drugs you are currently on might also be causing your depression or anxiety and your doctor might prescribe you a new kind to alleviate the symptoms.

, After having done some research on different forms of antidepressants, come with some suggestions and questions for your doctor. Tell them what medication you’re interested in and why and ask questions about the side effects of the drug.Find out what antidepressants they typically prescribe and which ones their patients have had the best experiences with.

, Most antidepressant medications are only available via prescription and can be obtained from a licensed pharmacist. Before you leave the doctor’s office, make sure your doctor provides you with a prescription for the antidepressant or that someone from the office calls the prescription in for you.

Find out more about the cost of your medication and whether it will be covered by your health insurance provider, if applicable. Certain antidepressants may be more costly than most other types of prescription drugs and many offer generic forms that are much cheaper.

, Many commercial drugstore and pharmacy chains are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week so you can fill your prescription and begin treatment immediately. You will likely have to wait a few hours before it is filled.

, After you get your prescription, you might have questions for your doctor. Or perhaps you have started taking the medication and something doesn’t feel right. In any of these cases, contact your doctor to ask questions or set up a new appointment if necessary.If they are not in, you can ask to leave a message or email them.

, Some doctors are hesitant to write a prescription for an antidepressant, believing that the patient may be able to improve their symptoms through other lifestyle changes. However, if you feel that your depression, anxiety, or other disorder is debilitating, then you can seek a second opinion. Make an appointment with another doctor or psychiatrist in your area to get their medical opinion."

Assess the injury for range of motion and nerve damage.,
Decide what type of splint to use.,
Protect the patient’s clothing.",How to Apply Splints2," Before splinting, check the injured limb and document any damage to the patient’s skin or surrounding area. Most importantly, check their nerves and blood vessels for injury – you will need to compare this after splinting to make sure the splint is not compromising blood flow, nerve conduction, or swelling.This assessment will also help you to determine whether a splint vs. a cast is appropriate.Let the patient know that they should seek immediate medical attention if they experience any tingling, loss of sensation, increased pain, delayed capillary refill, dusky appearance to skin, or severe swelling.

, Different splint methods are used for different injuries. This is not a comprehensive list, so be sure to study or consult a trained professional to establish the correct type and posture for splinting. Generally, consider these guidelines:


Use an ulnar gutter splint for Boxer’s fractures (fracture of the distal 5th metacarpal) and other injuries to the 4th and 5th fingers and metacarpals.Use a sugar tong splint for fractures of the humerus.Use a long-arm posterior splint for elbow injuries.
Short-arm splints may suffice for distal forearm and wrist injuries.Use a thumb spica splint for thumb injuries.Splinting and taping one finger to another, one leg to another, or an arm to the torso can effectively immobilize a limb.

, Plaster splint material can produce dust, and water may drip from the material onto the patient. If time and urgency allow, drape the patient’s clothes with a sheet, towel, or cloth to protect their clothing."

Gather your splinting materials.,
Apply the stockinette.,
Ensure the limb is in the appropriate position.,
Wrap padding around the limb over the stockinette.,
Measure your splinting material.,
Decide on the splint thickness.,
Soak your splint material in water.,
”Squeegee” the splint material so it’s moist and flat.,
Apply the splinting material.,
Fold back the edges of the stockinette and padding.,
Let the splint dry and apply an elastic wrap.,
Provide other necessary equipment to your patient.",How to Apply Splints3," To do a proper, professional splint you will require certain medical materials. Gather all of your materials before beginning your splint. You will need:Splinting material, usually made of dry plaster (though sometimes fiberglass material is used).
Scissors.
A bucket or large pot of cool water.
A roll of soft cast padding.
A stockinette.
A roll of elastic bandage.
Medical tape or clips to secure bandage.
Sheets to protect the patient’s clothing.
Sling or crutches, optionally.
Casting gloves, if you’re using fiberglass splinting material.

, Stockinette is applied as the first layer of splinting to protect the patient’s skin from direct contact with splinting material. Measure the stockinette so that it extends 10cm on both sides of the intended splint range. Gently pull the stockinette over the affected limb. Cut small holes for fingers and toes, as needed – especially for the thumb.Use 4 inch wide stockinette for lower extremities, and 2-3 inch wide stockinette for upper extremities.
Make sure the stockinette fits snuggly, and smooth out any wrinkles. If it’s too tight and constricts blood flow at all, use a wider stockinette.
If a lot of swelling is expected, skip using the stockinette or any circumferential materials. In this case, thicker, wider padding material should be used.

, Injuries heal best, and complications are avoided, when the limb is splinted into the appropriate position. Specific injuries require specific posturing, so be sure to learn or consult a professional before splinting. Follow these basic guidelines:Place the wrist in slight extension and ulnar deviation. Let the hand rest in position as if holding a can of soda.
When using a thumb spica splint, place the wrist at about 20° of extension and flex the thumb slightly.Place the ankle into 90° of flexion.
For long-leg casts, allow the knee to flex slightly.

, Splint padding is applied between the stockinette and splinting material to allow the limb to swell. Take your roll of padding material and wrap it around the limb circumferentially – snugly, but not so tight that it impairs blood flow. Roll from one end of the limb to the other end. Each roll should overlap the previous roll by 50%. Apply 2-3 layers of wrapping. Allow for 2-3cm of extra padding on both sides of where the splint will end.As you wrap the limb, apply extra padding to the edges of where the splint will be, between the fingers or toes, and over bony areas such as the heel, malleolus, elbow, and ulnar styloid. This helps prevent pressure sores.
Keep the padding flat and wrinkle-free. If it creases, remove and reapply it.

, Measure the amount of splint material you need – lay dry plaster splint material next to the injured body part to judge the length. The width should be a little wider than the diameter of the body part being splinted, and 1-2cm longer than you want the end product to be. Cut or tear the appropriate length of dry splint material you need.The splint should end up being slightly shorter than the padding.

, A splint generally ranges from 8-15 layers of dry splinting material. On average, use 6-10 layers for upper extremities and 12-15 layers for lower extremities. The necessary thickness depends on which body part needs splinting, the patient's size, and how strong the splint needs to be. Use the minimal number of layers necessary to get the right splint strength.Use fewer layers for petite patients or non-weight bearing injuries.
Use more layers if the splint needs to support weight, the patient is large, or the injury is to a joint (and requires more immobilization).

, Place your dry splint material in a deep bucket of cool water. Try to lay it flat into the water, if possible, to avoid wrinkling or creasing the material. Wait for the splint material to stop bubbling before removing it.


Do NOT use warm water. Splinting material sets faster when warm water is used, and the faster the material sets the more heat it produces as a byproduct. Using cool water will greatly reduce the risk of burns to the patient as the splint sets.Fiberglass splinting material sets more quickly. If you’re using room-temperature water or fiberglass material, you’ll have to work quickly. Remember to wear gloves if working with fiberglass.

, Take out the wet splint material and squeeze it gently to remove excess water. Do not wad or ball up the material – hold the material up with one hand and clamp the material with your first two fingers of the other hand. Apply gentle pressure as you “squeegee” your fingers down the strip, squeezing out extra water and keeping the material as flat and smooth as possible. Plaster will still be wet and messy, but should not be dripping water; fiberglass will feel damp.Lay the material on a flat surface and smooth any wrinkles out of the splint layers. Make sure all the layers are flat. Wrinkled and bumpy material will put pressure on parts of the body when it dries, which can cause pressure sores, nerve injury, and pain.

, Ensure the limb is in its proper posturing. Place the wet splinting material over the padding, and use the palm of your hand to smooth the material into position. When you reach the end of the splint, fold the next layer back on itself to create the following layer. Repeat this until the splint has the appropriate number of layers.


Do not use your fingers to mold the splint; this can create dimpling and cause pressure sores and nerve problems. It’s very important to keep the splint material as smooth as possible.
Splints are applied to only one or at most two sides of an extremity; they are NOT circumferential. Full, circumferential casts can be applied to an injured limb once all swelling has gone down.

, Once your splint is applied, fold back the extra length of padding and stockinette over the edge of the splint. This should create a smooth edge.Check for any discomfort, pressure points, or vascular problems before finishing the splint. Re-perform neurovascular tests at this time to ensure the splint is comfortable and not compromising blood flow or nerve conduction or applying more pressure to certain areas. It’s better to re-do an ill-fitting splint now than before it dries, and much better to fix a splint than cause medical problems later.

, Ensure that the limb is postured correctly. Wait for the splint material to dry completely. Then apply an elastic wrap around the splinted limb, from farther from the body to closer to the body. This should keep the splint in place and provide some support, but should not be constricting. Be very careful to avoid wrinkles, and to keep the wrap evenly layered throughout.Secure the wrap with medical tape or clips. Do not tape around the splint in a circle when finishing it. Tape along the sides of the splint to allow room for swelling.

, If the splint covers the elbow, it may benefit the patient to use a sling. Provide crutches for any lower extremity injuries that require non-weight bearing. Ice packs can help reduce pain and swelling.

Change your diet.,
Exercise.,
Talk to your loved ones.",How to Get off Suboxone2," A diet designed to boost endorphins and other mood enhancing chemicals can help the withdrawal process in addition to the emotional effects of ending an addiction.


High-quality proteins are important. You should aim to get in 20 – 30 grams of protein three times a day. Opt for lean proteins like chicken, fish, and turkey.Consume a variety of fruits and vegetables as well as heart healthy fats that are found in olive oils, canola oils, avocados, and nuts.The consumption of sugar and processed foods should be limited, if not cut out altogether.Make sure to drink a lot of water. The rule of thumb is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water (1.9 liters) a day, but if you're detoxing from Suboxone you might need to drink a bit more., Daily exercise can boost endorphins, causing a more positive mood overall. This can lessen the psychological symptoms of withdrawal and help you stay focused on your commitment to a healthier, happier existence.


Exercise boosts mood, improves sleep, reduces pain and promotes good overall well-being. Strive for 30 to 60 minutes of vigorous exercise a day.How you choose to exercise is up to you, but know that people generally stick to exercise routines if they engage in behaviors they enjoy. If you enjoy long walks at night, incorporate a brisk daily walk into your routine. If there's a sport you enjoy, like tennis or softball, try to join a league in your area or find a friend to join you for a tennis match a few times a week.

, Talk to friends and family members whom you trust and explain your situation to them. Ask for their support during your recovery and have a few good friends you can rely on when you're having rough days.


Community is incredibly important to an addict's recovery. In a study on rats, researchers placed some rats in groups and some rats alone in a cage. The rats were presented with a choice of two different water bottles. One was laced with cocaine and the other was normal water. In both groups, rats tried both kinds of water; however, it was only the rats who were left alone who became addicted to the cocaine-laced water. Scientist believe this demonstrates that socialization and support are powerful tools in combating addiction.In people, this has proven true as well. During the Vietnam War, many soldiers were functionally addicted to heroin overseas. When they returned to their homes, 95% of soldiers simply stopped heroin use without rehab or treatment. Comparisons have been drawn between this and the rat study. Both rats and humans had an easier time combating addiction when placed in a happier environment.During your recovery process, reach out to friends. Try to see people on a regular basis. Have a weekly game night or book club. Go to a community center in your area and enroll in an art or cooking class. Try to meet people and form a comforting, happy environment for yourself.

Try detox supplements.,
Join a support group.,
See a therapist.",How to Get off Suboxone3," Detox supplements can be effective at minimizing symptoms of withdrawal and help with the process of detoxing.


Calm Support is an opiate withdrawal formula made from all-natural substances. It has a high rate of easing withdrawal symptoms for many people and can be ordered online.DL-Phenylalanine is another supplement, available at drug stores and online, that can help with detox symptoms.As always, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before trying any new medications. Make sure supplements won't react poorly with any existing medications you're taking and won't adversely affect any of your current health problems.

, As support is so important in the recovery process, finding a support group in your area can help greatly with the recovery process.


Narcotics Anonymous is a national organization that provides support for people recovering from addiction. You can browse their website to find support groups in your area. They also provide support groups for friends and family of addicts, if anyone you know is struggling with your issues.If you can't find a support group close by, there are many of online forums where you can talk to other people detoxing from Suboxone; however, be careful. Never rely on information from an online forum for medical advice.

, Addiction is usually driven by underlying psychological issues. If you're in the detox process, see a therapist.


Your insurance provider should have a list of psychiatrists and clinics who take your plan on their website. You can also call and ask if you're confused about coverage. If you're a student, many colleges and universities offer free counseling on campus.
If you're on a budget, most big cities have therapy clinics that offer free and reduced counseling to people in need.

Cleanse the wound.,
Flush out the wound.,
Pat the area dry.,
Brush away debris from the wound.",How to Apply First Aid without Bandages2," Cleanse and irrigate the wound with anything that you have available. Obviously potable water, also known as drinking water, is first choice because it is suitable for drinking and thus suitable for other human uses. If fresh water is unavailable, you can also use a carbonated beverage, such as cola. If you happen to have a small hand sanitizer available, cleanse the wound with this.Do not introduce anything that would increase the chances of infection such as juice, grease or milk. The same goes for scummy-looking pond or creek water sources. If you are near a beach, rinse in the ocean. Salty ocean water can act as a stand-in saline solution for your wound.

, Flushing out the wound with a flowing water source that has some pressure to it is recommended as one of the best measures you can take to prevent infection.If fresh, potable water is available to you, try to running that over the wound for several minutes. You'll want to use about 2 liters of water, an amount roughly the size of a large soda bottle.

, Find something that you can dry the wound with, such as a piece of cloth, towel or other soft material. Avoid using anything fluffy that could leave fragments in or get stuck to the wound., If you don't have any water or fluid available or if you're in a desert area, use a portion of your clothing to brush away any debris from the wound. Try to find the cleanest portion of your shirt or pant leg to use."

Inspect the wound.,
Stop the bleeding.,
Reposition the victim so the wound is above the heart.,
Cover the dressing.,
Fasten the dressing in place.",How to Apply First Aid without Bandages3," You want to get an idea of the how much blood loss you are dealing with. Immediately after cleaning the wound, inspect it for depth and any signs of damaged blood vessels, such as squirting or pulsatile blood flow. The average person has approximately eight liters of circulating blood; a loss of 10 percent of this blood volume can have serious consequences, including loss of consciousness and lack of blood supply to vital organs.Take this opportunity to evaluate for wound depth, as a wound of one centimeter or greater will usually require sutures once you can get some medical care.
Do not remove an object if it is embedded in the wound. Leave it in the wound; it is helping to stem the blood flow. Removing the object will actually increase blood flow. Medical professionals will be better able to remove the object without damaging any internal organs or causing massive blood loss in the process., Since you don't have gauze or bandages, apply firm pressure on the wound with a clean and absorbent material, like a shirt, towel or sock. If the item becomes soaked with blood, don't remove it as this can disturb any blood clots that may be starting to form. Instead, place another piece of material on top of the soaked one and keep applying direct pressure.If there is an object is still in the wound, press firmly around it. Applying pressure to the wound will help to slow the flow of blood.If the wound is gaping and bleeding profusely, try stuffing the wound with a towel or blanket, or with tampons if they are available, and then applying pressure. Right now it is more important to stop the person from bleeding out than worry about possible infection.
Some first aid training suggests using the edge of a credit card to ""seal"" the wound, an item that's handy because so many people have one on them. Not only does this stem blood flow, but it may also prevent lung collapse (by keeping air out of the wound) if the wound is in the chest.If the wound is bleeding profusely, apply pressure to the major artery leading to the area with your hand, while your other hand continues to apply pressure on the wound. These areas are called ""pressure points"". For example, to slow bleeding in the arm, press the inside of the arm just above the elbow or just below the armpit. If the wound is on the leg, press just behind the knee or in the groin.In certain situations, it may be necessary to use a tourniquet. A tourniquet should only be used on a limb and if the person is experiencing a life-threatening limb hemorrhage that is not controlled with the application of pressure or if there is a life-threatening injury to the limb, such as an amputated or mangled limb., This will help reduce blood loss. If the victim can sit, get him to move himself into an upright position; if not, then help the victim if possible.Make sure the patient doesn't walk. Walking, and especially running, can act like a second pump to the circulatory system and can cause as much trouble as the heart.

, Since you don't have gauze or bandages, use a piece of your clothing (shirt, coat, socks, etc.) or other material (from a tent, raft, etc.) to cover the wound once the bleeding slows or stops. Alternately, you can also use plant life to cover the wound to stop any bleeding. Look for plants that have leaves large enough to cover the wound. Depending on the regional flora and fauna, you may even find some plants or leaves with medicinal purpose, such as the Comfrey or Ki plants.Avoid using tissue paper or toilet tissue as these are quite fragile and may actually contaminate your wound with fragments and debris. Any fabric that absorbs the blood effectively can be used to apply pressure.
Do not lift or remove the dressing as this will disrupt clot formation and re-start the bleeding. If the dressing becomes soaked with blood, add more cloth material on top of it.
For a chest wound, be careful. Cover the wound with something like kitchen foil, a plastic bag or cling-film and only cover three sides of the wound and leave one un-taped or bandaged down. Air needs to be able to escape from one side of the bandage to prevent it from entering the pleural cavity in the chest. If air enters the pleural cavity, the lungs can collapse.

, Use string, tape, rope, or torn strips of clothing to tie the dressing in place. Do not tie so tightly that blood flow to the affected area is cut off.


If you don't have any materials to fasten the dressing in place, simply continue to apply pressure. This will help the blood clot."

Be cautious about moving anyone.,
Create a sling.,
Splint a broken arm or leg to give it support.,
Pad the splint.,
Minimize swelling.",How to Apply First Aid without Bandages4," Only move someone if there is imminent danger, such as a fire, car accident, or other potential surrounding hazards. If there has been a fall and the person is having neck pain or cannot move his legs or arms, do not move him at all. For a suspected spinal cord injury, leave the patient until emergency services arrive with backboards and cervical collars. Immobilize them in the position in which you find them and call for emergency help immediately.Any movement could cause paralysis, so providing reassurance to the person while you await help is the best course of action.For other fractures, such as an arm or limb, only provide first aid if emergency medical treatment is not expected soon because moving and tending to the fracture can do more harm than good. However, if treatment in a medical facility is not immediately available, you can help to stabilize the bone and relieve the pain using the following guidelines.

, If the affected limb is an upper extremity, like arm, you can create a ready-made shoulder sling easily with your shirt or sweatshirt. Carefully maneuver the uninjured arm out of the sleeve while keeping the shirt around your neck. Pull the fabric up where your elbow is bent at 90 degrees and rest your elbow in the lip of the uplifted shirt. This will safely immobilize any fracture in your shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist.


You can also cut a more traditional sling out of your shirt or other fabric, like a pillowcase if you have scissors or the cutting utensils. Cut the cloth into a big square (about 40 inches square) and then fold the square diagonally into a triangle. One end of the sling should go under your arm and over the shoulder. The other end should go over the other shoulder. Tie the two ends together behind the neck.A sling will not only provide significant pain relief but also keep bone fragments from moving around.

, Do not try to realign the bone.To make a splint you can use material you have on hand or can find nearby. Look for rigid material to make the splint, such as a board, stick, rolled up newspaper, and so on.Extend the splint to beyond the joint above and below the break. For instance, if the lower leg is broken, the splint should go above the knee and lower than the ankle.A cardboard box makes an excellent device to immobilize a lower extremity, like a leg. You will have to fashion it by tearing or cutting the sides, to fit the affected area. You want to place the box flush with the ground and slide it under the leg, encircling the leg with the cardboard. Secure the cardboard with tape, rope or torn cloth strips from what you are wearing. Be sure to fold an edge of the box at the bottom to support the ankle joint so that it is not freely, flopping this can extremely painful. Do not attempt to maneuver the extremity, leave it in the position of most comfort to the victim.

, Use clothing, towels, blankets, pillows or anything else that is soft that you have with you. Secure the splint to the area. You can use a belt, rope, shoelaces, anything that is handy that will keep the splint in place. Be careful when you apply the splint not to cause further injury to the body. Pad the splint well so it doesn’t add pressure to the injured area but only immobilizes it., If ice is available, such as from an ice chest or an ice pack, apply to the area to minimize swelling. In a pinch, you could really use anything cold, such as cold cans of soda."

Adhere to your doctor’s instructions when taking your medication.,
Stay on your medication.,
Know the side effects of your drug.,
Get therapy, as well.",How to Get Antidepressants2," Taking less or more than the recommended dosage can increase your risk for side effects and other health problems. If at any point you feel the need to increase your dosage to better treat your depression, consult with your doctor first to receive approval or to discuss alternate treatments.

Don’t take any medications that will interact negatively with the antidepressant.

, Most medications take weeks to begin working, so keep taking them as your doctor has prescribed. Set an alarm on your phone to help you remember to take your meds.

If after a few months of regular doses you still feel that the meds aren’t working, consult your doctor.

, The side effects will vary based upon the drug that you are prescribed, but learn more about them before you begin treatment. In addition to consulting with your doctor, do your own research. Find out what you can do to prevent or lessen the occurrence of these side effects, such as making dietary changes., Antidepressants may work well for you, but they tend to work better in conjunction with therapy. If you are able to afford it, seek professional counseling to help you work through your issues."

Get enough sleep.",How to Get Antidepressants3," Meditation has been shown to reduce anxiety, stress and to improve the mood. Some report that it is as or more helpful than antidepressants in treating mental illness. Spend ten undisturbed minutes or more each day in a quiet space focusing on your body and your breathing. There are several apps that you can download to assist with meditation, including Headspace and Calm., Exercise is also beneficial in improving your overall physical and mental health. It provides time each day to give your mind a break while you focus more on your body. Take a walk around the neighborhood, go for a run, or join a local gym., The diet has also been shown to be highly connected to mood. Foods high in sugar or fat tend to cause more symptoms of depression or anxiety than do foods high in protein or vitamins, like vegetables and lean meat.Cut out fast food and sweets for one month and assess if your mood improves.

, Assess any areas in your life that are causing you undue stress and determine how you can manage or cut them. For instance, if you are often rushed every morning getting your child to school, send them on the bus or have your partner take them some mornings. Small changes can drastically improve your overall mood., Try your best to avoid secluding yourself during this difficult time for you. Connect with your friends and make plans to hang out at least once per week. Go see a movie, have dinner, or just spend time chatting.Avoid hanging out with negative friends.

, Sleep is also critical in maintaining emotional stability. Be sure to get a minimum of seven hours of sleep per night. Start a relaxing nighttime regimen that will help soothe you to sleep like taking a warm bath or having some hot tea.Try to go to bed at the same time every night.

Acquire crutches from your hospital or doctor.,
Borrow crutches.,
Find crutches online.,
Purchase crutches at a drug store or pharmacy.,
Get crutches from a medical supply company.",How to Find Crutches1," If you have had surgery or visited an orthopedist with an injury or complaint, your hospital or doctor will usually issue you a pair of crutches – typically underarm crutches in the U.S. and forearm crutches elsewhere. Before accepting them, or indeed before your surgery, ask how much they cost and how much of the cost will be covered by insurance. Some hospitals, in particular, overcharge for crutches.You can save by purchasing your own.


The advantage of getting crutches from your hospital or doctor is that your healthcare professional will help you ensure that the crutches fit properly. If you buy them on your own, you may not buy ones that fit correctly.;
, If you know someone who has had knee or ankle surgery or suffered a broken bone and recovered, they may still have their crutches. Especially if they had a nicer pair than the standard underarm crutches, this is a great way to get a good pair of crutches for free. Just make sure the crutches fit you and that they are in good repair.


Pay particular attention to the rubber tips on the bottoms of the crutches. They wear out quickly, but can be replaced cheaply.

, Particularly if you are looking to buy spring-loaded or articulated crutches, you will usually need to go online. Large vendors like amazon.com, drug stores, and medical supply companies such as Allegro Medical and the Medical Supply Group all offer crutches for sale online, making the internet a great place to comparison shop and get the best price. However, there are two drawbacks:


Medicare rarely reimburses online purchases. If you have private insurance, you will need to request an invoice in order to file a claim, and your insurance company may not reimburse you.
It is important to try out crutches to ensure comfort and fit. If you are buying online, consider ordering several pairs of crutches and returning all but the ones you prefer. Check the store's return policy first to ensure that you can get your money back without paying high return fees.

, Most drug stores sell crutches, but be aware that your choice will be limited. Many stores offer only one type of underarm and one type of forearm crutch. Be sure to make sure the store participates in Medicaid or to contact your insurance company to make sure the crutches are covered by your insurance.

, Like drug stores, local medical supply companies typically only offer one type of underarm and one type of forearm crutch. However, particularly if you are borrowing a pair of crutches that needs repair, medical supply stores can be a good place to get replacement crutch tips or handles.

Ask your doctor whether crutches are appropriate.,
Choose the style of crutches that is right for you.,
Check out the tip of the crutches.,
Pay special attention to the handles.,
Make sure your crutches fit.",How to Find Crutches2," Crutches require significant arm and upper body strength. In some cases, crutches may not be appropriate for you. If you do not have good arm and upper body strength, or if you have a hand or wrist injury as well as a leg injury, crutches may not work for you.Ask your doctor what she recommends.


For people who have had total knee or hip replacement surgery, or have significant balance problems, walkers offer more stability than crutches do.Walkers or wheelchairs may be more appropriate for the elderly.If you have nerve damage or visual impairment, crutches may not be the best choice for you.
Using crutches requires learning new gait patterns, or how to walk. If you have cognitive impairment, your doctor may recommend a walker or wheelchair instead.

, Underarm crutches have a pad that is held under the arm. These are commonly prescribed, but they are usually meant for temporary use rather than long-term. Long-term use of underarm crutches can cause nerve damage or shoulder tendinitis. In addition, there are several other less-often prescribed crutches that might fit your particular needs:


Forearm/elbow crutches – Crutches with an open cuff that grips the user’s forearm. They are more difficult to master and require more strength, but also offer more control over your movement and are preferred for active patients or long-term users who will have time to build the necessary strength. They are also more comfortable as the cuff takes pressure off the wrist. People with cerebral palsy commonly use this type of crutch.
Strutter crutches – These are a patented type of crutch similar to underarm crutches, but with a larger base to provide greater stability. They may make it more comfortable and easy to walk.Platform crutches – For users with a weak grip. These crutches allow uses to strap their arm to the crutches in a position that keeps their hand resting on the handle.
Hands free crutch – This crutch is for people with injuries below the knee. It straps to your knee when your leg is bent and acts as a peg-leg, allowing you to walk with your hands free. These crutches are usually not covered by insurance unless your doctor indicates you cannot use traditional crutches.

, Most crutches have a rubber tip that takes your weight and prevents slipping. Always make sure the tip is unbroken. If you will be using the crutches for a long time or plan to be very active with them, consider crutches with a flexible tip or a spring-loaded tip that makes walking easier., The handle is where you will put all your weight when you walk, so it needs to be comfortable. Padded ones are generally preferable. If you will be using crutches for a long time, consider purchasing ones with ergonomically shaped handles that fit your left and right hands., Only purchase crutches that are adjustable.Your crutches should be the correct height to ensure you can walk with upright posture and not put too much pressure on your wrists.Underarm crutches – When wearing shoes, the pad at the top of the crutch should be an inch or two below your armpit when the tip of the crutch is resting on the floor about 2 inches in front of your toes. The handgrip should allow for a slight bend (about 15°) of your elbow when standing normally.
Forearm crutches – When wearing shoes, place your arm in the crutch. When correctly adjusted, the tip of the crutch should rest on the floor when you bend your elbow (about 30 degrees) so that the crease of your wrist is level with your hips.

Buy crutches without health insurance.,
Use health insurance.,
Acquire crutches through Medicare.",How to Find Crutches3," Basic underarm crutches typically cost $15 to $40. Forearm crutches run from about $40 to $100. Spring-loaded and articulated crutches start at $119 for the Millennialand go up to as much as $1000 for deluxe models., Most health insurance covers both underarm and forearm crutches. However, upgrades that are considered a convenience, and which do not “significantly enhance the functionality” of the crutches are typically not covered. This means that spring-loaded or articulated crutches are usually not covered.


Call your insurance company to see what they cover before purchasing crutches.

, All people with Medicare Part B or Part C (medical insurance) are covered for the purchase of crutches. You will pay 20% of the Medicare approved amount ($78.57 per pair for forearm crutches and $42.12 for underarm crutches), and the Part B or C deductible applies. To acquire crutches through Medicare:The crutches must be prescribed by a medical provider participating in Medicare.
You must acquire the crutches from a supplier who participates in Medicare.
If you go to a non-Medicare doctor of supplier, Medicare will not pay the claim they submit and you will be responsible for the cost.
Articulated and spring-loaded crutches are not covered by Medicare.

Recognize a general loss of appetite.",How to Determine the Side Effects of an MMR Vaccination1," When receiving a shot, most people experience some immediate redness and swelling around the injection site. This is a common occurrence and should go away with in a day or two.Place a clean cold cloth on the injection site for 5 to 10 minutes if it is flushed, sore, or swollen.Avoid rubbing or touching the point of injection. This will only lead to more soreness and inflammation.;
, Because the vaccine may make your child feel ill, it is likely that they will be more fussy or lethargic. This may be result of a mild fever or other discomfort. In most instances the fever will go away after one or two days, but it can last longer.Comfort your baby with cuddling or take them for walk in fresh air in order to help them feel better. If your baby seems very uncomfortable, try a dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil). Your doctor should provide proper dosing information for these medicines.

, One in six people who receive an MMR vaccine will experience fevers. These fevers can occur at different times after receiving the vaccine because each begins working at different intervals. Typically, fevers become less common two weeks after receiving the injection. Treat the fever with pain and fever relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil), and keep hydrated, but remember that you should never give aspirin to children under 16.The measles vaccine begins working after six to ten days and may cause a fever at that time.
After two to three weeks the mumps vaccine may cause a mild fever.
The rubella vaccine may cause a slightly raised temperature around 12 to 14 days.

, One in twenty people who receive an MMR vaccine will experience a mild rash. Again this is the result of the various vaccinations and can occur at varying times following the injection. There is not treatment for the rash and it should go away after one or two days.If the rash appears immediately or within four to eight hours, visit your doctor right away because this may a sign of an allergic reaction.If the rash persists for more than a few days consult your doctor. Your child may be experiencing another skin condition.The measles vaccine may cause a rash to appear after six to ten days.
The rubella vaccine may cause a brief rash around 12 to 14 days.

, One in seventy-five people who receive an MMR shot will experience some swelling of the glands in the cheeks and neck. This is a mild form of the mumps and is a common side-effect of the vaccine. Children and infants may have some difficulty eating or nursing due to tenderness from the swelling. These symptoms can appear two to four weeks after the injection and generally only last for a few days., Because a raised temperature can cause nausea, a decreased appetite is a common symptom of the MMR vaccine. Nausea is typically the result of the measles vaccine and can last for two to three days.A loss of appetite may also be the result of sore or swollen glands in the face and neck.It is important to drink some extra fluids during this time, and watch for signs of dehydration, which may include decreased or concentrated urine, fatigue, or feeling weak or dizzy.

Report any seizures.,
Look for bruise-like spots.,
Recognize pain and stiffness in the joints.",How to Determine the Side Effects of an MMR Vaccination2," Due to high fever, infants sometimes experience convulsions or febrile seizures. During a seizure, the child’s body may stiffen, they might lose consciousness and their arms and legs will twitch. These typically occur in children between the ages of six months to three years.Take your child to the doctor after they have a fit to ensure that it is the vaccine causing the seizure, and not another disease.Febrile seizures are extremely rare, only occurring in one in every 1,000 to 3,000 doses of the vaccine. While febrile seizures are scary to watch, they aren't usually dangerous or long-lasting. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or if the baby seems very ill.
Children who receive the combined MMR vaccine are twice as likely to have febrile seizures as those who get the separate shots., In very rare causes a child may develop a small rash of bruise-like spots known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The spots may also look like tiny bright-red dots, which are called petechiae. This is a side-effect of the rubella vaccine and develops in one in every 24,000 to 30,000 doses.There is a greater risk of developing ITP from a measles or rubella infection than from receiving a vaccine.
The rash typically gets better on its but you should still consult your physician as soon as possible.

, The rubella vaccination can cause temporary arthritis in adults. One in four adult women who receive the MMR vaccine will experience joint discomfort following. This side-effect mostly impacts teenage and adult women. Take a common pain reliever to treat symptoms.These symptoms generally begin one to three weeks after receiving the injection and can last for about two days. These symptoms are rarely long term."

Report allergic reactions.,
Be aware that brain swelling is an extremely rare side-effect.,
Understand that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.",How to Determine the Side Effects of an MMR Vaccination3," A very small minority of people may experience anaphylactic shock as a result of an allergic reaction to the MMR vaccine. Those experiencing anaphylactic shock will likely have a rash, body swelling, nausea and vomiting, and difficulty breathing. If you or your child experience any of these symptoms after receiving the vaccination see your doctor immediately.Call 911 in the United States (or emergency services in your country) if the person if having difficulty breathing, wheezing, or swelling of the lips or tongue.


Fewer than one in a million doses of the MMR vaccine are known to have resulted in a serious allergic reaction., Measles inclusion body encephalitis is a severe swelling of the brain that is the result of infection by the measles virus. It is a rare disorder that usually develops within a year of being exposed to the wild measles infection. There have only been three reported cases of this complication happening to people with the MMR vaccine, and only one of those identified the MMR vaccine as the cause.Nausea, severe headaches, and blurred vision are symptoms of brain swelling.
Visit your doctor immediately if you believe that you are experiencing encephalitis.

, Because the signs of autism are usually noticed at the same time that children are recommended to take the MMR vaccine, many people attribute the onset of autism with the vaccination. However, safety experts agree that the MMR vaccine does not cause non-autistic children to become autistic.Many research studies have shown that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.
There are likely many causes of autism, including various genetic and environmental factors.The source of the MMR vaccine controversy stemmed from Andrew Wakefield.Wakefield's evidence of the vaccine causing autism was falsified, and his medical license was revoked."

Review their data sheets so you know you are using only the best components., If the chosen component does not match up to the requirements, keep an alternative ready so that you don’t lose any time in the PCB design process., Just as you did with the original components, check the alternate components as well. Take a look at their performance history as well as the data sheets. This needs to be done to determine their success and failure ratings. Treat the alternate components with the same care and attention that you gave to the original components so that you will be prepared, should you have to use them., As the design and layout phase is coming to a close, the designer has to also create an assembly drawing. This drawing is used to avoid any guesses or mistakes during the fabrication and assembly processes. Also, jot down detailed notes about all the revision levels or REV if there are any changes in the original design., Identify the various points in your design that can be assigned on the board for testing purposes. The more number of test points provided, the better the chances are of reducing errors during the testing phase."

You may also need to clean the area of the skin where the injection will be administered.
The bandage and cotton ball are used to cover the area of the skin where you injected the medication to reduce bleeding.
The sharps container is the thick plastic bin that holds the used supplies, including the syringes and needles. When you use a lancet, syringe, or needle, these items are called sharps. Proper storage of used sharps is a safety measure. When the containers are full, they can be transferred to a place that destroys biohazard equipment.Each state and/or city may have their own protocol for disposing biohazard material/sharps disposal sites. Contact local health department for specific instructions on how to dispose of hazardous materials.;
, If the injection you are giving is something other than insulin, the product literature that comes with the medication provides precise instructions on preparing the drug for administration. However, this literature should be considered a refresher and not the sole source of information — it is very important that a qualified medical professional trains you on preparation and how to administer the medication. If you have not received this training, you should not try to give someone an injection.


Not all medications are packaged the same way. Some medications need to be reconstituted with water before administration, while others may require using only the syringe and needle that comes with the product. Be thoroughly familiar with the steps you need to take that are specific to the medication.
Most injections given at home, other than insulin, will be done using a single dose vial. The label will say either single dose vial, or will contain the abbreviation, SDV.
This means that that only one dose can be given from that vial, regardless of the amount remaining after you have withdrawn the amount of medication you need.
In some cases, you may be administering a medication that is packaged in a vial called a multi-dose-vial. The package label will have the words multi-dose vial or the abbreviation MDV. Insulin vials are considered a multi-dose vial.However, this is rare for medication intended for home use.
If you are using a multi-dose vial, write the date, using a marker that will not wipe off, when the container is first opened.
This type of product usually contains small amounts of preservatives, but still should not be used at all once 30 days after the first date of opening has passed, unless your doctor advises you differently. Keep these products in the refrigerator, but not frozen, between uses.

, In order to maintain your safety, check the medication vial for several elements:Be sure you have the right medicine, and it is the right strength.Be sure the expiration date has not passed.Be sure the product has been stored according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. For example, some products can be stored at room temperature, while others may need refrigeration.
Check the integrity of the packaging. Make sure there are no cracks or dents in the vial that holds the medication.
Look for particulate matter. This means you must examine the medication in the vial to be sure nothing unusual is floating inside the container.
Examine the seal. Make sure there are no cracks or dents in the seal around the top of the vial.

, Be sure the syringe and needle have not deteriorated or been damaged.


Visible cracks in the barrel, or discoloration of any part of the syringe, including the rubber top on the plunger, indicates the syringe should not be used.
Examine the needle for damage. Check the needle to be sure it is not broken or bent. Do not use any product that appears to have been damaged.
While some packaged syringes have a visible expiration date, many do not. If you are not sure, contact the manufacturer. Have any lot numbers available when you call.
Discard damaged or deteriorated syringes safely in a sharps container.

, Do not interchange syringe types. Using the wrong type of syringe can easily result in giving the wrong amount of medication.Insulin syringes are intended for insulin administration only. The markings along the barrel are in units, and are specific for insulin dosing.
Your syringe should be able to hold a little more than the required amount for the dose. The needle should be the correct length for the type of injection you are going to administer.Your doctor or pharmacist should have trained you on proper administration of the drug, including the type of syringe and needle recommended. You can use the product literature as a reference as well, but only once you have received adequate training.
If you have any questions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. They can help you to be sure you have the correct syringe-needle unit for the medication you are giving.

, Safety syringes have a patented way to safely recap the needle once the medication has been drawn up. Practice this method prior to drawing up the actual dose of medication. This helps you to be prepared to re-cap the needle in situations where you do not give the prepared dose immediately.Discard the practice syringe safely in a sharps container.
It is generally not recommended to re-cap syringes, as this can result in accidental needle sticks.

, Thoroughly clean your hands using soap and water. Include washing your nail area, and between your fingers., Some medication, like insulin that appears cloudy, need to be gently mixed before drawing it up. Roll the medication between your hands gently. Do not shake it, as this will create bubbles. The product literature will advise you on products that should be gently mixed., Wipe the rubber seal with an alcohol pad. Allow the alcohol to air-dry. Do not fan it with your hand or blow on it. Doing this may contaminate the cleaned area., Your target is the line, or mark on the barrel, that is equal to the amount of medication you need to draw up., Use caution not to touch the needle.

, Use a straight motion as you push the needle into the top of the medicine bottle., This forces the air from the syringe into the bottle. You are inserting the amount of air that equals the amount of medication you will be removing., Do this carefully so as not to dislodge the needle from the bottle. Hold the neck of the bottle between your thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand. Support the syringe with your other hand. Do not allow the needle to bend., Use your dominant hand to pull the plunger back to the line marked on the barrel of the syringe indicating the prescribed amount of medication. Do not remove the needle from the medication vial yet, Gently tap the barrel of the syringe. This will move any air bubbles trapped in the medication toward the needle., Once the air bubbles are at the top of the syringe, push the plunger until the air bubbles are removed. A small amount of medication may squirt out as you remove the air bubbles., Once you have removed the air bubbles, check the amount of medication remaining in the syringe to be sure you have the exact dose you need.

, Avoid touching the needle once you have drawn the medication into the syringe. If you do not plan to give the injection immediately, then place a safety cover, as practiced, back on the needle.If you do not have a safety re-cap feature, carefully use the needle to scoop up the original needle covering. Then you can secure it in place with your fingers., Injection techniques vary depending on the type of injection being given.

, According to the World Health Organization, there are 4 areas of focus in giving injections safely. Those 4 areas include:


Avoid giving unnecessary injections.
Always use sterile equipment, including the needles.
Avoid contaminating the injection as it is prepared.
Properly dispose of the used syringes and needles., Once the injection has been given, discard of the needle in a sharps container.


A needle that has pierced the skin of someone is not only dulled, but contaminated with possibly serious and contagious diseases.

, Sharps containers are designed to be a safe way to dispose of syringes and needles. Sharps containers are available for purchase at your local pharmacy, or online.Never put syringes or needles in the regular trash., Many states have specific recommendations and programs that can help you develop a regular system for disposing of biohazardous waste. Sharps, including used needles and syringes, are considered to be biohazardous waste since they came in direct contact with someone's skin or blood., Some companies offer to supply you with the appropriate sizes of sharps containers, and agree to set up an arrangement for you to safely mail those containers back to them when they are full. The company will dispose of the biohazard materials appropriately, according to EPA, FDA, and state requirements., Some states have specific guidelines regarding the disposal of unused medications.


In many cases, you may able to place the opened vials of medication directly into the sharps containers. Your pharmacy, physician, mailback company, or state agency, can advise you on the proper disposal of unused medication., Syringes are categorized by how their parts work and how they are designed to function., Common syringes most recently used in clinical practice are called luer-lok syringes. Luer-lok describes the type of locking mechanism built into the tip of the syringe. The mechanism works by securely holding luer-lok needles once they are twisted in place.


Using this type of syringe requires an added step in assembly. The added step is to secure the needle to the syringe, prior to drawing up the medication., Examples of syringe types that are designed for a certain purpose or function include an insulin syringe, tuberculin syringe, and safety syringe.


Insulin syringes are intended only for giving insulin. The barrel is graduated in units instead of mls.
Tuberculin syringes are used when you need to give a very small dose of a medication, such as 0.5mls., A safety syringe is an all-in-one unit. That means that the syringe has a pre-attached needle, so the added step of attaching the needle by hand is not needed.


A safety syringe also has a built-in mechanism that either covers, or retracts, the needle once the medication has been administered to the patient.Due to the increasing number of healthcare accidents involving needle sticks, regulatory agencies are mandating the use of safety syringes in healthcare facilities. Safety syringes are recommended by health organizations including the CDC and the World Health Organization., A syringe is made of 3 basic parts. Those parts include the barrel, the plunger, and the tip., The barrel is the clear part in the middle that holds the medication. The barrel is marked with numbers and lines in a graduated manner. These help to guide you as you fill the syringe. The inside of the barrel is considered to be a sterile environment.The numbers indicate the amount of medication you are putting in the syringe in mls, or ccs. The abbreviation “mls” stands for milliliters. The abbreviation “ccs” stands for cubic centimeters.
ONE ml is the same as ONE cc.
The numbers and lines on an insulin syringe indicate the units of insulin being drawn into the syringe. Insulin syringes usually have a graduated measurement in mls also, but this is in smaller or lighter type. The focus of an insulin syringe is to provide clarity regarding the number of insulin units being drawn up.

, The plunger is the part of the syringe that you manipulate as you fill the syringe. The end of the plunger extends out from the bottom of the syringe, and gently glides inside the barrel. This action helps you to accurately draw up the correct amount of medication.The rubber tip of the plunger that slides inside the barrel is considered sterile. The lower part of the plunger extends from the bottom of the syringe. This is the also the part you push to deliver the medication when you give the injection.

, The tip of the syringe is where the needle is attached. For reasons of safety and convenience, safety syringes, or all-in-one syringes, are available with the needle already attached.Using a luer-lok syringe requires attaching the needle. This type of syringe, and the separate needle, have grooves that allow for the needle to be securely attached to the tip of the syringe with a simple twisting motion.

, The needle attaches to the tip of the syringe and has 3 parts. Those parts include the hub, shaft, and bevel.The hub is the part closest to the barrel where the needle connects to the syringe.
The shaft is the longest part of the needle.
The bevel is the very tip of the needle that comes in direct contact with the skin of the person receiving the injection. Needles are designed to have a slight slant, or bevel, on the very tip.

, Many drugs that must be administered by injection are now being packaged by the manufacturers in kits that contain everything you would need, including the syringe and needle.If you need to purchase the syringe-needle combo unit separately from the medication, try to find safety syringes that will work for the medication and delivery site needed.
Syringes can be purchased separately from needles, but for safety reasons this is not recommended. Even hospitals are being mandated to use safety syringe-needle combo units to avoid complications that include a greater risk of infections for the patients and needle stick injuries that may occur to the staff.

, In order to select the correct syringe, it is important that you understand what you need to properly fill the syringe and give the injection. An all-in-one syringe needle unit will have 3 distinct numbers on the package labeling.


One of the numbers indicates the size of the syringe barrel, such as 3cc. A second number will give the length of the needle, such as 1 inch. The third number indicates the gauge of the needle, such as 23g.
Always select a syringe that holds more than you need to inject. If your medication requires that you inject 2cc, same as 2mls, for each dose, then you will want to choose a syringe that is larger, say a 3cc, or 3ml, syringe.
The needle length is specific to the place where the medication needs to be delivered. Something that needs to just go under the skin would require a shorter needle, such as ½ to ¾ inch. If you need to get the medication delivered into a muscle, you will need to select a longer needle size.
The size of the person receiving the injection is also something to consider. Obese people may need a longer needle to reach a muscle than people with less body fat.
The gauge of the needle tells you how fat the needle is. It is actually a measure of the diameter of the hole inside the needle. Some medications are thicker and need a fatter needle to properly pass the medication through it and into the skin. Other medications can be given using a skinnier needle.
The numbers that tell you the gauge of the needle are backwards. The larger numbers indicate the smaller actual diameter of the needle.
Using an 18 gauge needle would allow for a thicker medication to pass through easily, but it also might hurt a little more. A 23 gauge needle has a smaller diameter for the medication to pass through.
Try to select the smallest thickness, or diameter, of the needle, meaning a higher number, that will work with the medication you need to inject. Remember, the larger the number, the smaller the thickness or diameter.

, Syringes hold medications that are intended to be given by injection. Injections can be given by 3 primary routes.Subcutaneous injections are a common type of injection administered at home. Insulin is administered in a subcutaneous manner.
IM, or intramuscular injections, are more complicated than giving a subcutaneous injection. This is the type of injection that requires getting the medication delivered into muscle tissue.
The final route is called intravenous. This is not a common route of administration, unless someone has an indwelling venous catheter, or they are in a hospital setting. IV medication should never be administered at home unless through a port-a-cath and patient's have been trained sufficiently. This is very dangerous and if done incorrectly, can introduce bacteria into blood stream, thus causing systemic deadly infection.

Strategize plans for anxiety management during the procedure.",How to Endure an MRI Scan," Although you may be limited in how the specialist places you in the machine, be sure to position yourself in a way that is comfortable. Take any prescribed medications before your procedure, unless told otherwise by your physician, in order to avoid any discomfort. , Depending on your triggers, a darker or lighter room may make you feel more at ease. The correct ambience will put you at ease and make the time appear to go by quicker. Talk with the specialist/technologist and your physician about means to improve the environment in which the MRI imaging is taking place. , Maintaining a comfortable temperature will limit your anxiety. Most hospitals or imaging centers should have blankets available if the room is too cold. A soft blanket will also add an extra layer of comfort. , Depending on the procedure, an MRI scan can take anywhere from 15 to 90 minutes, so you will want to have on clothes that you can lay around in for a while. Do not wear tight or restrictive clothes, which may intensify your feelings of discomfort and possibly feelings of claustrophobia. Instead, wear clothes that are loose-fitting and allow for lots of air movement. If you are unsure what to wear, talk to the MRI specialist or your physician about appropriate clothing for your procedure. Avoid wearing clothes with any metal. You maybe asked to change into a hospital gown, which can increase anxiety, if your clothing is incompatible with the machine.

, Because you have to be positioned a certain way during the MRI scan, there are a variety of different pillows created specifically for MRI procedures that will help you stay comfortable while you are in the imaging machine. Typically, the hospital or imaging center should have pillows available for you to use. However, if these pillows are unavailable, or you find them uncomfortable, talk with your physician or the imaging specialist about buying your own MRI pillow to bring to the procedure.

, Familiar and relaxing media can sooth your fears and distract you from the noises of the MRI machine. The MRI machine can be noisy, increasing your anxiety, but soothing sounds and peaceful images can help you feel more relaxed and comfortable during the procedure. Ask ahead of time if the MRI suite has music you can listen to, or if you can bring a favorite CD and the staff can provide headphones. You will not be able to bring your own media device or headphones, as they contain metal that can interfere with the process.
Some MRI machines have built in video screens that play relaxing images. Consult your doctor or imaging specialist to see if a machine with a video monitor is available.

, The MRI scanner will make loud sounds during the procedure, which can be unsettling and anxiety inducing. Ask the MRI specialist if you can use a pair of earplugs or noise canceling headphones to wear during the procedure. , This practice helps promote relaxation through mental self-regulation. Meditation can take many forms and include different objects, such as prayer beads. Many practitioners repeat a “mantra” that helps them their mind, while others emphasize a prayer of other utterance. , Inhale and exhale slowly. Focus your mind on each breath.

, Repeat as many times as necessary. Count to 20 if ten is too short.

, Visualize yourself in that space, emphasizing its details in your mind. This practice will help you mentally distance yourself from the MRI procedure and its accompanying anxiety.

, Ask for a wet washcloth or an eye mask to set over your eyes before you begin. This prevents you from seeing your surroundings, which may trigger your claustrophobia or anxiety. , It is important to maintain as many of your daily habits as possible the day of your procedure. This will help limit your anxiety going into your MRI scan. Eat your normal foods. Unless your physician tells you otherwise, you can eat normally the day of your scan. However, keep in mind that you cannot move during the scan so be sure to avoid foods that might cause gastronomic discomfort.
Drink plenty of water; however, remember that you cannot take bathroom breaks during the scan and some procedures take as long as 90 minutes, so be sure to go to the bathroom before getting into the machine.

, Being tired amplifies anxious feelings so it is important to get a good night’s rest before your MRI scan. Adults between the ages of 26 and 64 need seven to nine hours of sleep a night to ensure proper mental and physical health.Talk to your physician about taking a sleep aid the night before your procedure to ensure you are well-rested. However, keep in mind that many sleep aids may make you groggy and might not be compatible with other medications. Always talk with your doctor before taking new medications.

, They will help soothe you during the procedure by maintaining physical contact (holding your hand or touching foot). Be sure to bring someone who does not have a medical condition (pregnancy or metal implants in their body such as a pacemaker or aneurysm clip) that would prevent them from being in the imaging room. If friends or family members are unavailable, the hospital or imaging facility may supply a staff member to stay in the scan room with you. Communicate with the your friend/family member and the support staff during the procedure. This will help you feel more at ease and distract you during the procedure. There are speakers in the machine, as well as a call button or squeeze ball you can press or squeeze to communicate with the staff.

, With your health provider, discuss the possibility of taking a mild sedative before the procedure. Patients often find these types of medications relaxing and helpful in limiting anxiety. A prescription for the sedative will be required before the date of the appointment. Be sure to talk with your pharmacist about the medication and its side effects before the appointment.
Because sedatives can make you tired or groggy, be sure to get a friend or family member to drive you to your appointment. Some imaging centers offer free transportation so be sure to make arrangements with the facility before your visit.
Complete any important paperwork ahead of time due to the limiting effects of sedatives.

, Consulting with a mental health professional may help alleviate your fears by addressing the underlying feelings and emotions. Your mental health provider may recommend practices or techniques designed to target the root causes of your anxiety. , Talk with the hospital or imaging center staff about the procedure before the day of your appointment. Understanding what type of MRI machine you will be using, and the techniques associated with it, and visiting the hospital or imaging facility before your appointment can help you avoid any surprises on the day of your scan and make it a stress-free experience., Discuss your medical history with your doctor to ensure that you do not have a condition that would prevent you from getting an MRI. Those who are pregnant or have a metal implant, such as a pacemaker, cannot receive an MRI. , If available at your location, ask the receptionist to schedule you in the open MRI. There are different imaging machines that are less restrictive, creating an environment less likely to induce claustrophobia. An Open High Field MRI has open sides and nothing holding you down. In an Open Upright MRI the patient sits or stands in the machine and there is nothing in front of their face. However, this machine produces less detailed scans and is less common. , Be sure to inquire about the length of the procedure and the steps involved in the MRI imaging process. Depending on the body part being imaged, you may not need to fully enter the MRI machine. For example, to acquire images of the knee, leg, or foot the patient only needs to insert their leg into the scanner tube - not their entire body. , Patients generally experienced less anxiety if they met a staff member before their appointment. Calling for information may also be helpful if visiting the center is impractical. , Discussing the hospital or imaging center’s resources for making the experience more pleasant may alleviate your fears. The doctors and technologists may have tips and strategies that will help you feel more at ease. "

Wait for emergency services.",How to Decide to Use a Tourniquet (Home Remedy)," Your job is to stabilize the victim and keep him from bleeding out. Whenever you find yourself in an emergency situation where someone is bleeding profusely, pouring (or even spurting), always try pressure first to stop the bleeding. If pressure does not work, you can quickly consider whether you could use a homemade tourniquet. You should only make and use a tourniquet if the bleeding refuses to stop despite pressure (and never for the neck, torso/abdomen)., If you are alone with the bleeding victim, try to get the bleeding under control before you spend time phoning for help.


If there is someone else present at the scene, ask one person specifically to to call 911 while you assess and deal with the wound.If you are in a group, do not simply say, ""Someone call 911!"" Look at someone directly and say, ""You! In the green jacket! Call 911!""

, To decide exactly what to do to a wound, you need to figure out what kind of wound it is. If you can’t see the extent of the wound because of blood, waste no time. Find a clean cloth and wipe off the blood to see the wound instantly. Remove/or cut away any clothing or jewelry covering the wound, only as necessary. However, if there is debris stuck in the wound, do not remove it. Leave anything jabbed or forced into the wound alone for emergency services to handle.If you have time and there are the proper resources, wash your hands or grab medical gloves to help prevent infection or the spread of bloodborne diseases.

, Once you get a good look at the wound, elevate the victim’s injury as much as possible. Keep the part of her body that’s wounded above the heart so the blood will not flow as quickly. Then, using a clean towel, gauze, t-shirt, or any cloth you have handy, make a compress to place over the bleeding wound. Lay the compress over the wound and press down extremely hard.


If the wound is a shallow cut, then simple pressure can be applied.
If there is a puncture wound, a fracture that has resulted in bone breaking out of the skin, a gunshot, or other, more traumatic injury, you may need to do more than apply pressure. However, applying pressure should always be your first step.

, When you initially apply the compress, you need to hold the pressure on the wound for a minimum of 15 minutes. If the wound continues to bleed, keep applying pressure as long as you can.


If the compress becomes soiled with blood, do not remove it. Simply apply an additional compress on top of the soaked one. If you remove the compress, you run the risk of disturbing the blood clots that might have developed over the wound.
If the cloth is not soaked and it looks as though the bleeding has stopped on a wound that is not serious, you can lift up the cloth to assess the state of the wound., If the wound is bad, the victim may go into shock. Take note of any changes in his behavior or state of consciousness. If you notice signs of shock, make sure you call emergency services if you haven’t already. These include:Passing out or losing consciousness
Dizziness or lightheadedness
Weakness or difficulty standing up
Enlarged pupils
Pale, clammy, and cool skin
Rapid pulse or breathing
Acting less alert or less aware, a change in how the person responds to questions, or an increase in confusion, fear, or restlessness

, If pressure doesn’t stop the bleeding, if you are in the wilderness, if you are unable to call emergency services for some reason, if there are too many injuries to treat with pressure, or you are in some other emergency circumstance, you may need to apply a tourniquet to stop the bleeding of a victim’s wound. You should only ever use a tourniquet as a last tool during an emergency situation.This is because there are a number of serious problems associated with tourniquet use.

, If you find you absolutely need to use a tourniquet to save someone’s life, there are some complications that can arise that should be taken into account before tourniquets are used. Factor that should be kept in mind are:Tourniquets that are applied too loosely can cause the bleeding to get worse. Arterial blood is under higher pressure than the other blood, so if the tourniquet is too loose, it may let arterial blood through while blocking other blood.
Tourniquets that are released too soon can cause damage to the compressed blood vessels and the bleeding will resume.
Tourniquets that are left on too long can damage the nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. As a general rule of thumb, permanent damage can result if the tourniquet is left on for more than one to two hours.
Placing tourniquets on the wrong area, such as too far from the wound or on a joint, can be ineffective.
Tourniquets, if applied correctly, can be very painful.

, If you are going to make a proper tourniquet, you need to find the right material for the area that you are using it on. Tourniquets should be at least one to two inches wide (2.5-5 cm). Smaller tourniquets should be used on the arm and thicker ones should be used on legs. Rip or cut strips of cloth from a shirt, towel, or bed sheet to make your tourniquet fabric.


Tourniquets that are too narrow or thin can cut into the skin while very wide tourniquets need to be tied very tightly to be effective.
Make sure the fabric is not elastic or slippery so it doesn’t move around.
You can also use readymade tourniquets, such as a belt or robe tie., For the tourniquet to be effective, it must be in the right place. The tourniquet should be two inches above the wound on the part of the limb closest to the heart. It also must be applied with enough pressure to completely stop arterial blood flow.


Do not apply the tourniquet on a joint such as an elbow or a knee. The blood flow through joints is protected so that it isn’t interrupted when the joint is bent. Also do not apply it over clothing so it won’t slip once tightened.
Arterial blood flow is the blood that will spurt because of the action of the heart pumping.
Never tie a tourniquet on any part of the body that isn’t an arm or leg. , Tie the tourniquet using a regular square knot. Make sure the knot is tight. If you plan to use an object to help along the tightening process, you will need to tie two knots. Tie the first knot to place the fabric on the limb. Then, place the five to eight inch long piece of wood or smooth metal, called a winch, above that and tie another knot on top of it.


Make sure the winch is smooth so that it doesn’t cut the person or the tourniquet. It can be a stick, smooth metal utensil, pencil, pen, or other long object. , If you are using a belt, tighten the belt as much as possible to stop the bleeding. If using the winch, tighten the tourniquet as much as you can to stop the bleeding by twisting the winch around so the fabric gets pulled tight around the limb.


Tourniquets on leg wounds need to be tighter than those on the arms because the blood vessels in the legs are larger., Once you have applied the tourniquet, wait for emergency services. Make sure to record the time the tourniquet was applied. When emergency services arrives, they will need this information. If EMS is delayed, cooling the injured limb with ice or cold packs may help reduce tissue damage while the tourniquet is on.



Do not remove the tourniquet unless you can apply direct pressure to the wound. If you can, remove the tourniquet carefully, watching for bleeding and signs of shock.
If blood is still seeping around the wound, do not remove the tourniquet. "

See your doctor.,

Check the FDA to see if the product is harmful.,
Beware of other harmful side effects.,
Beware of people looking to make money.",How to Determine if a Sexual Enhancement Product Is Legitimate1," You can sidestep the possibility of illegitimate sexual-enhancement products altogether by starting with a visit to your doctor. Most of these products do nothing at best and are potentially harmful to your health at worst. Legitimate prescription medications exist for many issues related to sexual performance, including erectile dysfunction. See your doctor to determine if any clinically proven medications backed by verifiable medical research are available for your issue.Make sure that you tell your doctor about any medications or supplements you are taking. Some medications may interact negatively with each other.;
, Go to clinicaltrials.gov and search by product name. This website—run by the U.S. National Institutes of Health—contains the results of all official testing of medical products.Any product on the market should have the research data to prove its efficacy, and any manufacturer of a product should want to make this information publicly available to prove to consumers that it works.No published clinical trials mean that the product either proved ineffective in a trial and the data wasn’t published or the company simply hasn’t performed any trials—both of which mean the product’s claims are probably illegitimate.
Moreover, don’t automatically believe advertising for a product that mentions clinical trials. Do your own research (such as with the NIH link above) to verify the trials. Companies can easily run trials of their product that fall short under the scrutiny of actual scientific rigor, or they can simply claim to have run trials. Again, if they actually ran an authentic trial that proved the efficacy of their product, they’d rush to publish it in reputable locations.

, Claims from individuals about a product are easy to make up and don’t require being held up to scrutiny. Never let testimonials for a drug or anecdotes about its effectiveness stand in place of hard scientific data in the form of published research and clinical trials.By ignoring this baseless support of a product, you’ll immediately notice that it’s just meant to fill the void of legitimate medical information.

, Any company can purchase an online photo of an actor in a lab coat and claim the product is ""doctor recommended.” Google the name of the physician and determine if the person is a real doctor with a specialization in the area of sexual medicine. Is the physician associated with a prominent hospital? Has the physician completed research and published papers in medical journals?


Additionally, if no name appears next to the alleged doctor, then this makes it even less likely that the person is a legitimate medical professional.

, Clinical trials might not be the only information published about a product. PubMed is another site run by the National Institutes of Health, and it includes over twenty-four million citations related to credible medical research, including information of medications, herbs, and other supposedly performance-enhancing chemicals., If the product is a pill, lotion, spray, or cream, do a search on the ingredients to determine if it is medically viable for the claimed use. PubMed is a reliable source for conducting this research.Many products may also claim to have discovered a group of well-known ingredients, combined in just the right ratio, to unlock the desired performance. If this were true, the company would file for, and receive, a patent on the invention in order to obtain the maximum financial return. Search the U.S. government patent database for any such claims, filed by company and inventor name.

, Many sexual-enhancement products illegally add quantities of prescription drug ingredients, unstudied ingredients, and even controlled substances in order to boost claims.These products are often categorized as “dietary supplements” since such supplements do not require approval by the Food and Drug Administration.The hidden ingredients of these products make them potentially dangerous or liable to negatively interact with other medications you may be taking.


You can find a complete list of the products known to contain hidden ingredients on the FDA website here.These are just the products that have been identified to contain such ingredients and likely represent only a small percentage of sexual-enhancement products that do contain them.

, Pills aren’t the only potentially harmful sexual-enhancement products. A number of pumps claiming to increase penis size are also on the market, for instance. Even products like this that can appear to have temporary effects on appearance can do long-term damage by damaging the elastic tissue of the penis and ultimately leading to erectile issues later on., Legitimate self-help ideas spread quickly. People love to help others and not make money from it. And the internet is a great way to do that. Be extra careful of those who claim a method, exercise, thought process or ""trick"" that can help improve your sexual performance - but only if you buy their book, DVD or newsletter. Don't you think that people who have had such great success with this idea would share it on a blog or website?

Communicate with your partner.,
Exercise to lose belly fat.,
Learn what constitutes “normal”.,
Trim your pubic hair.,
Practice Kegel exercises.,
See your doctor.,
Consider seeing a counselor.",How to Determine if a Sexual Enhancement Product Is Legitimate2," Many sexual enhancement products for both men and women promise to increase libido. However, decreased libido relates more to stress, comfortable habits in relationships, and poor communication. Though it may be awkward at first, have a frank discussion with your partner about your sex habits. Discuss your fantasies and listen carefully to your partner’s as well. Simply communicating openly about each other’s desires can help break old routines and breathe new life into your sex life.This is guaranteed to be healthier for your relationship and much healthier for you than an unregulated “miracle” drug.


Not only will an honest talk about sex likely reignite your libido, but if pleasing your partner is your concern, then honest communication can help you learn more about what your partner likes and wants out of sexual interactions. Ensure that you stay open to the feedback instead of becoming frustrated or defensive.

, Regular exercise to get in shape can improve your sexual performance for a number of reasons. Regular cardio will increase your stamina and endurance, including between the sheets.Additionally, shedding some excess pounds will make you feel sexier. Nothing can kill your libido like not feeling very sexy, and getting in shape goes a long way for self-confidence.


For men seeking enhancement products for penis size, a “beer gut” hanging down can also make your penis appear shorter than it actually is.In addition to the reasons above, exercising to lose some belly fat can also offer a more flattering appearance to your penis.

, Much of the perceived need for sexual-enhancement products related to penis size stems from a misperception regarding the average penis size. Actors in adult films can especially skew that perception for those who watch them. By realizing the actual average size, you can assuage some of the anxiety related to feeling improperly equipped. The actual average size of an adult male penis is:Between three and five inches (eight to thirteen centimeters) when flaccid
Between five and seven inches (thirteen to eighteen centimeters) when erect

, For men who worry about penis size, bushy pubic hair around the base of your penis can make it appear smaller than it is.Try trimming down the pubic hair around the base of your penis, which will increase the visible amount of natural length.

, Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic floor and can help with delaying orgasm. If premature ejaculation is the issue for which you’ve been seeking an enhancement product, then try these exercises instead. A 2012 study showed that twelve weeks of regular Kegel exercises more than quadrupled ejaculation response time.The easiest version of this exercises is simply to squeeze the muscles that allow you to stop urinating midstream. Once you isolate how flexing these muscles feels, you can do it discreetly at home or work even without urinating.

, While most sexual enhancement products are bunk, several clinically proven medications are available by prescription for problems such as erectile dysfunction (ED). See your doctor, discuss any problems you’ve had with regard to getting or maintaining an erection, and see if he or she thinks that a prescription medication is appropriate for your situation., Often the root cause of issues related to sexual performance is mental. Stress, anxiety, and depression can all affect both your libido and you ability to perform sexually. See a certified counselor who can help you sort through what’s weighing you down and negatively affecting your sex life.A number of licensed counselors specialize in the field of sex therapy and may have specific recommendations to assist you with building and maintaining confidence with regard to your sexual performance. A sex therapist can help with issues ranging from ED to premature ejaculation and much more."

Be aware of how a tourniquet works.,
Only use a CAT if there is heavy bleeding from a wound or life threatening injuries.,
For slight injuries or bleeding, apply pressure to the wound and a bandage before using a tourniquet.,
Always remove the tourniquet if it has been on the wound for more than two hours.,
Understand that CATs are painful to apply.,
Use cheaper, alternative material if you don’t have access or can’t afford a CAT.,
Practice using a CAT on yourself.",How to Correctly Use a CAT Tourniquet," These are areas where bleeding from the wound cannot be controlled by direct pressure.A tourniquet does not work on the wounds on the head, neck, chest or abdomen; never apply a tourniquet on these areas as it can lead to further injury such as nerve damage.;
, Call the person at the scene by their full name, if you know the person, and instruct them to call EMS immediately while you apply the CAT on the injured person or on yourself.


If you don’t know anyone at the scene, point at someone close by and instruct them to call EMS. For example, “You in the black, please call EMS immediately”.

, This will prevent the transmission of harmful microorganisms into the wound., You’ll need:


Combat Application Tourniquet - you can purchase one online or at your nearest medical supply store. If you do not have one readily available, you can use alternative material like a rope, belt, or elastic bandage.
Two or three sterile dressings or a clean cloth.
Sterile gloves.
Medical tape.
Scissors.

, Do this by holding the upper two edges of the package and pulling it sideways to easily open it.


Do not touch its content as this can make it unsterile.

, Speak clearly to them and be honest by explaining the procedure will be quite painful. This will prepare them, and let them know what to expect. It will also establish trust and cooperation., Doing this will prevent the transmission of harmful microorganisms by creating a physical barrier between your hands and the surface or any fluids it comes in contact with., You want to make sure you can see all of the wound so you know the extent of their injury.

, Applying direct firm pressure into the wound without interruption stops bleeding by compressing the sides of the torn blood vessel, thus reducing blood flow.If the sterile dressing or clean cloth is already soaked, get another one and put it on top of the first sterile dressing or clean cloth. Doing this will help to absorb more blood from the wound.

, If bleeding has stopped, get a new sterile dressing or clean cloth and apply it on top of the wound. Secure the edges with medical tape and use the scissors to cut the tape.


If the bleeding has stopped or appears under control, you do not need to apply a tourniquet.

, Keep in mind the use of a CAT should only be used as a last resort because it is a painful and prolonged application that can result in nerve damage.

, As the procedure will be a painful one, slow, deep breathing will then slow down their sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for pain perception. This will block pain signals travelling to their brain.You can also talk to the person to distract them as you apply the tourniquet.

, The constriction caused by the CAT prevents blood from flowing into the wound, thus stopping the bleeding.


Do not place the tourniquet below the injured area since it will not stop the bleeding and may even make it worse.

, This should be done the same way you would secure a belt around your waist.

, You can twist it counterclockwise or clockwise.

, If bleeding from the wound still continues, get another CAT tourniquet and place it 2 inches above the first CAT tourniquet.

, The faster help arrives the sooner medical treatment can be given and the less blood from the wound will be lost.


When a tourniquet is in place, it will likely be uncomfortable since the area under pressure. There may be a heavy grip or tightening feeling around the wound. This is normal as the tourniquet is trying to prevent further blood loss.

, If the injured person cannot take it anymore and is screaming in pain, this may be a sign of compartment syndrome, where increased pressure builds up in the person’s muscles.Adjust the tourniquet slowly while checking to see if there is still any bleeding from the wound. If there is no bleeding you may loosen the tourniquet but do not remove it. This is a precautionary measure in case bleeding starts again.

, When the self-adhering band on a tourniquet is tightened, pressure is placed at the site of bleeding, specifically in the artery that was injured. The pressure on the artery stops blood flow and blood loss from the wound., Do not place the tourniquet on minor injuries as it may cause more harm than good due to the lack of blood supply to the lower area of the wound.Heavy bleeding is characterized as excessive and continuous bleeding. Applying pressure to this injury may have no effect, so you’re only resort is a tourniquet.
Heavy bleeding usually occurs from injured arteries located in the wrist, neck, upper arms and the thighs.
There may also be heavy bleeding from large wounds on a person’s extremities.

, If the bleeding does not stop, place a bandage on the wound.


If it still does not stop, then you may use a tourniquet.

, Prolonged use of a CAT can lead to nerve damage.If the injured person’s leg or arm was amputated, do not remove or loosen the tourniquet. Amputation in the legs or arms may cause massive bleeding, so the tourniquet should remain in place., While pain may vary from individual to individual, tourniquets will cause a level pain in the area. This could be a sharp, dull, throbbing or excruciating pain. As well, the longer the tourniquet is on, the more intense the pain becomes.

, Though tourniquets are easy to use and reusable, they are not cheap. The estimated cost of a CAT is about $25.So if you don’t want to spend money on a CAT or are in a situation where a CAT is not readily available, you can use alternative or cheaper material like a rope, a cloth, or an elastic bandage.

, The most effective way to learn how to correctly apply a tourniquet is to try it on yourself first.


Studies have shown that the incorrect use of the Combat Application Tourniquet can cause death. So, proper placement and use of the tourniquet is essential to prevent blood loss and death.Take precautions when practicing since this procedure will cut the blood to your extremities. Do not keep the tourniquet in place for a long time. If you feel any numbness on the practice area, remove the tourniquet.

Prepare the cannabis.,
Heat the oven.,
Put the cannabis in the oven.,
Allow it to cool.,
Know what decarboxylation is.,
Recognise why to do it.,
Act responsibly.",How to Decarboxylate Cannabis," If you have cannabis that you want to use in cooking, decarboxylation is a vital part of the process. Start by breaking up the cannabis into small pieces. Then put the cannabis onto a baking tray, and spread it across the tray as you would whatever you were cooking., To decarboxylate cannabis, you need to heat it to around 240 degrees Fahrenheit. This is the temperature at which decarboxylation occurs.Heat your oven to this temperature, before placing your baking tray of cannabis into it.

, When the oven is up to temperature, place your tray of cannabis in there. To achieve the maximum amount of decarboxylation, you need to heat it until the bubbling dissipates.There is no fixed amount of time you should leave it in there for, but around an hour is generally considered to produce the best results.


Keep an eye on it, and give it a quick stir every ten minutes or so.
Cannabis with a higher moisture content may take longer than an hour, but you should never raise the temperature above 240 degrees Fahrenheit., After around an hour, you should remove the cannabis from the oven and allow it cool. You will notice that the colour will have changed, and become a medium brown. You will also notice it has dried and it should have quite a crumbly texture.


Once it has cooled you can grind it in a food processor so that is in made into a small enough powder to use easily in cooking.
Store it in an airtight container like your other herbs and use as appropriate., The marijuana flower contains THCA, which in its natural state, is not psychoactive. The psychoactive THC is only created through the process known as decarboxylation. By heating the THCa, that THC is activated and can then be absorbed when consumed., The main reason to decarboxylate cannabis is to achieve the maximum potency and efficiency for oral consumption, rather than for medicinal purposes.A separate process of decarboxylation is not necessary when cannabis is smoked or vaporized, because the heating involved releases the THC without needing any prior decarboxylation., Decarboxylation can greatly increase the potency of cannabis. If you are cooking something and are going to include decarboxylated cannabis, be sure to act sensibly and recognise just how potent it might be. It can easier to consume a larger amount of cannabis in food than by smoking.

Determine your warranty options before you buy the hearing aid.,
Check if your health insurance covers some of the cost of the hearing aid.",How to Compare Hearing Aid Prices," Professionals who recommend and sell hearing aids are known as hearing aid professionals or hearing aid dispensers. The professional may be certified as an audiologist or have specialized training on hearing aids. You can get a reference for a hearing aid professional from your family doctor. It's useful to consult with a hearing aid professional in person as they can offer recommendations on aids and help you compare prices.Many big box stores that sell hearing aids will also have hearing aid professionals on staff. However, getting a recommendation from your doctor will usually ensure the hearing aid professional is properly certified.
You can also get a reference for a hearing aid professional through friends or family who use hearing aids and have had a positive experience with their hearing aid.
Another option is to look up highly rated hearing aid professionals in your area through an online database.;
, You should set up an in person consultation with the hearing aid professional and ask her a few questions about her credentials. She may be a certified audiologist or have proof of training in fitting and selling hearing aids. The dispenser will use equipment to test your hearing and determine your need for an aid. The dispenser can then recommend the best aid for your needs and your budget.You may want to set up consultations with several different hearing aid professionals so you can compare prices and services offered by each professional. Aim to have consultations with at least two different hearing aid professionals so you can compare and contrast prices.
The professional should offer you aids from a variety of manufacturers and be willing to walk you through the selection process.
Most hearing aid professionals will charge flat one rate for testing, fitting, and recommending a hearing aid, though some dispensers may charge you separately for testing and fitting.
The dispenser should also show you how to use your aid and provide services for follow-up care and any needed adjustments. You should also receive oral and written instructions on how to insert your aid and care for it.

, The professional should first ask you a series of open-ended questions about your hearing loss issues and your hearing aid needs. Try to answer her as honestly as possible, as this will help her to determine the best hearing aid type for you.She may ask you how your hearing loss affects your everyday life, and where or when you notice the most difficulty with your hearing. She may also ask you if you are comfortable handling aids and dealing with batteries. Finally, she may ask you other questions about your medical history, such as a family history of hearing problems, any medications you are taking, and any prior experience you may have with hearing aids.

, If you have not already had your hearing tested by an audiologist or a hearing specialist, you should allow the dispenser to test your hearing. The dispenser will then use the results of the test to help you select a hearing aid.During the test, you will sit in a sound-controlled booth and wear earphones. You will then need to push a button or raise your hand when you hear a tone or a word. The dispenser may test your ability to hear certain tones and noises, your ability to hear certain speech patterns, and your ability to recognize words at different sound levels.
The test results will then be recorded on an audiogram. If you have perfect hearing, your audiogram would show a fairly straight line across the top of the graph. If you have hearing loss or hearing issues, the line may slope downward.
Be wary of any dispensers who offer “free” hearing tests. The cost of the “free” test may actually show up later wrapped into the price of the hearing aid. There should be no hidden strings attached to a “free” test.

, Once you have outlined your hearing aid needs with the dispenser, the dispenser should go over your options. Keep in mind that hearing aid manufacturers do not set retail prices, hearing care professionals set them. This means you may find the same hearing aid from a different dispenser at a lower price or at a more expensive price. You should discuss your budget with the dispenser and try to get the best price possible for a model or type of hearing aid you are interested in.You should ask the dispenser what exactly is included in the quoted price and have her break down exactly what you are paying for. The full cost could include testing, evaluation, fitting, and follow up care, as well as the actual hearing aid. You should have a good idea of what exactly you are paying for when you settle up with the hearing aid professional and be wary of any hearing aid professionals who do not want to break down your total bill for you.

, If you are looking for the best price on a certain model or type of hearing aid, you can shop around and get second or third opinions from different hearing aid professionals. You should get a copy of your audiogram and use it during consultations with different hearing aid professionals.If a different hearing aid professional would like to test your hearing, you should not pay to get them tested a second time. You can either show the professional your audiogram or insist you be tested again at no charge.
Your second or third opinion hearing professionals may suggest a different model or type of hearing aid. They may also offer you a better price on the hearing aid or give you a better deal on hearing aid package, which could include maintenance and support services for your hearing aid. Don’t be afraid to compare prices and select the professional that offers you the best option.

, As a consumer, you can do some research on your own to compare hearing aid prices. If you have access to the internet, you may do an online search for certain hearing aid types or brands. You may be able to read online reviews of the hearing aids and determine how much the hearing aids retail for. This information can then come in handy when you meet with a hearing aid professional and buy a hearing aid from them, as you will be well informed and less likely to get sucked in by inflated pricing.For example, maybe you are interested a behind the ear hearing aid. You can look up behind the ear hearing aids and note the price range of these types of hearing aids, usually $1,850-$2,700.
You can also buy a hearing aid online through an online retailer, which can be a cheaper option. However, you should make sure the hearing aid comes with a trial period where you can try out the hearing aid to see if it is right for you. You may need to try several hearing aids to find one that fits your ear comfortably and fits your hearing needs.

, You should also search for consumer reports on certain hearing aid brands to determine if they are well reviewed and well priced. A list of the top 10 most reviewed hearing aids can be found online.For example, maybe you come across a certain hearing aid brand, such as Miracle-Ear, that makes a certain type of hearing aid at a reasonable price. You should read the reviews for the hearing aid type to confirm it has mostly positive reviews. This could then increase the likelihood that you will also have a positive experience with the brand’s hearing aid.

, Shop around before you settle on a certain online retailer, as you may be able to find the same hearing aid at a better price from a different retailer. Do a search for a specific model or type of hearing aid and compare the prices on different sites. This will help you find the best price for the hearing aid.


Make sure the online retailers appear reputable and legitimate. You should avoid any online retailers who appear spammy or full of advertisements for other medical items. Most reputable online retailers will only sell hearing aids and offer a warranty as part of the online sale.

, Before you buy a hearing aid from an online retailer or a hearing aid professional in person, you should get a written contract. The contract should note everything promised during the consultation in writing. This will ensure you have physical documentation of the agreement in the event of an issue or problem with the hearing aid. The agreement should include:The name of the dispenser, the state registration number, and the registration expiration.
The manufacturer’s name and model, the serial number on the hearing aid, and the manufacture date.
A breakdown of the price for the hearing aid, as well as any other charges and services.
The length of the trial period for the hearing aid.
Any nonrefundable costs, such as testing and fitting costs.
The repair policy, including repair costs and any restrictions relating to repair of the hearing aid.
Insurance policy options.
The procedures if the aid malfunctions or fails to work properly.

, A warranty is a document that covers certain issues or problems with the hearing aid within a certain time period, usually one to three years. Ask the dispenser about your warranty options and make sure online retailers also offer warranties. You may also be able to purchase an extended warranty that kicks in after the manufacturer’s warranty has expired. You should ask several questions about your warranty options, including:How long does the warranty cover your aid? This is usually one to three years.
Does the warranty over all parts, fittings, and adjustments?
Does the warranty provide you with a new aid if an unforeseen incident damages the aid in any way? For example, maybe your dog eats it, you drop it, or you lose it.
Will you get an upgrade in the event of damage to the aid or the same model?

, Hearing aids can be quite costly, so you should check with Medicare about getting insurance coverage for some of the professional services related to the hearing aid, such as hearing tests. Medicare likely will not pay for the hearing aid itself.If you are a veteran, you may be eligible for hearing aids through the Veterans Administration. You will need to have a documented service that relates to your hearing loss or special needs. You may qualify for a disability rate of 10% or more on hearing aids. Check with your local VA office for more information.

Expect some discomfort early on.,
Learn how to put your brace on by yourself.,
Take good care of your skin under the brace.,
Be prepared to modify some of your regular movements.",How to Deal With a Back Brace1," When you first put on your brace it will feel almost like a cage for your torso. It will exert force against certain sensitive pressure points and may be slightly uncomfortable, especially for the first couple of days. This is to be expected and your doctor will make regular adjustments to the brace to ensure a better fit.Write down a few quick notes about any pressure that you experience and where it is located. You can then use these notes to talk to your doctor about any changes that need to be made.
Discomfort is not the same as outright pain. Monitor your pain levels closely and if your discomfort is connected with swelling, for example, contact your doctor immediately as this can be a sign of a more serious medical condition.;
, When you first brace you will rely on others to help strap you in and out. Watch their movements and take on a little more of the action each time. Practice placing the shell against your body or pull on a particular strap to see the degree of tension that is needed.It may be helpful to practice in front of a mirror. This will allow you to see the connections between how you move, how the brace responds, and the impact that it has on your body.

, It is important to be on the lookout for signs of pressure sores or skin breakdown when wearing a brace. This may indicate an improper fit.Check skin daily for reddened or broken skin, which may be caused by rubbing, pressure or moisture. Use a mirror to see your back and check for irritation there as well.Buy a good number of light cotton t-shirts to wear underneath your brace to protect your skin. Be sure the t-shirt fits smoothly with no wrinkles under the brace. Plan to change them often to prevent moisture from gathering against your skin. Only buy seamless shirts, as the seams can cause chafing.Avoid applying lotions as they will soften your skin and lead to more irritation. Instead, try a light application of rubbing alcohol or cornstarch., Be patient with yourself as you learn to move in your new brace. Go slowly and prepare for less flexibility in your torso area. For example, when you pick up items you will need to squat down instead of bending at the waist.


You may have a preferred sleeping position, but you may need to modify it when wearing your brace. Try on your side, on your back, etc., until you find the form that is the most comfortable.

Keep it positive and stick to things that you can visualize. For example, you might write, “I want to see my spine straight in an x-ray.”


Fold this list into a small square and carry it around with you. Look at it whenever you have negative feelings. When the paper wears out, re-copy or add to it and carry it again.

, Many people are very good at hiding their brace from public view. Do some online research to find people who you admire, or are interested in, who also wear a back brace. You will soon find that you are not alone.


Many athletes wear a brace at one point in their careers in order to recover from an injury or surgery. They are an especially good role model to choose if you are pursuing a physical therapy program as well.

, If you start to beat up yourself, hit the internet and enter the search terms “bracing” and “medical history.” You will find that you are actually quite lucky to have the opportunity to benefit from the modern technology of a brace. Even now there are places where people simply don’t have access to medical devices such as back braces.

, Your brace may already force you to maintain proper posture, but also keep your head up and look people in the eye as you interact with them. Avoid crossing your arms across your chest in a closed-off posture. These actions will display to others that you are a confident person and that you, rightfully, are not ashamed of your brace.

, You don’t need to change your fashion sense very much at all, just modify it a bit depending on the extent to which you want to show your brace. Many people choose to wear the same brands as before, just in a size or so larger.


For girls and women, empire waists and A-line dresses are particularly flattering when wearing a brace. They drape instead of clinging. Tiered skirts are also helpful if you want to downplay the lower part of your brace., When you first get your brace you will likely have the option to choose from plain or patterned versions. If you choose the plain one, you can always embellish it to suit your personality. Use art to turn it into an accessory and you will feel less trapped by it.


Some great examples of back brace artwork includes airbrush designs.You can also go even further and transform your brace into what appears to be a metallic piece of armor., Take the opposite approach of hiding and celebrate your braced body with a photo shoot. Put on your favorite outfits and then strike a series of poses in which you display your brace as part of you. You can keep these photos for yourself or display them.

Check the brace weekly for any visible damage, including frayed straps. Wash and deodorize your brace with mild soap and damp cloth daily. If there are padded liners, let them air dry or use a hair dryer on “cool” setting., On your phone, paper calendar, or journal, keep track of how many hours a day you need to wear your brace and how many hours you actually put in. Most back braces need to be worn between 16 to 23 hours daily. To achieve your goals, it is extremely important to wear the brace for exactly the amount of time recommended by your doctor.Expect to build up your wearing time over the course of a few weeks at least. This will give your body and skin time to get used to the brace.Make sure to add time to your schedule for putting on the brace. This can be a fairly involved process when you are first starting out with a brace.
You might want to consider purchasing one of the a brace-wearing app for your smartphone. These apps monitor and log your time in your brace and allow you to set personal goals., Some braces are meant to be worn up to 23 hours daily, while others can be worn for a much shorter period of time. You may be able to remove your brace for certain activities or at certain times. Talk with your doctor about when you need to take off your brace.


For example, certain activities such as swimming will require that you remove your brace for a short period of time. Just make sure your doctor approves your swimming as well as removing the brace for that amount of time.

, At the end of every week that you met your doctor’s goals for hours spent in your brace you should do something nice for yourself. Go out to a movie. Hit your favorite restaurant. Take your brace off and go for a nice swim. Be sure to check with your doctor regarding which activities you should avoid.

"
"
Ask your friends and family for advice and assistance.,
Connect with a support community online.,
Communicate openly and regularly with your doctor.,
See a psychologist for additional support.",How to Deal With a Back Brace4," Tell those people you trust about your schedule with the brace and about your intended goals. Talk about not only your actions but your feelings as well. It is not unusual to feel angry or scared when you first start this process.


You might say, “To be honest, I’m really not happy about wearing this brace, so if you hear me getting too negative try to find a way to cheer me up.”

, You are not alone, even if you feel like it initially. Go online and look for a network of people going through a similar experience as yourself. For example, if you are wearing a back brace due to a sports injury, you can find a blog to contribute to. If you are wearing a brace due to scoliosis, you should consider joining a Curvy Girls chapter.

, Before each visit write down a list of your noticeable improvements, your concerns, and any questions that you may have. Get to your most important points first and don’t be afraid to make another appointment if you need more discussion time.


For example, you might ask your doctor if you could see a series of x-rays showing your progress over time. You could also ask for an estimate as to when you can quit wearing your brace., If you feel weighed down emotionally and are struggling with negativity, you may want to make an appointment with a therapist. This will provide you with another space for safe conversation about your fears and hopes related to the bracing process."

Look at the different styles of hearing aids.,
Choose a completely-in-the-canal (CIC) or mini CIC for lowest visibility.,
Check out an in-the-canal (ITC) model.,
Try an in-the-ear (ITE) model for easier use and more features.,
Go for a behind-the-ear (BTE) model for more user flexibility.,
Opt for a receiver-in-canal (RIC) or receiver-in-the-ear (RITE) model for a lower-visibility BTE option.,
Check out an open-fit model for mild to moderate hearing loss.",How to Compare Hearing Aids1," There are several main styles of hearing aids. The one that will work best for you depends on personal preference, and weighing the pros and cons of each. Consider how easy the device is to use, how comfortable it is, and how visible it is.


It may be helpful to write down your list of priorities. Between cost, visibility, comfort, and other characteristics you notice as you check out different models, write down your needs from most to least important. This can help you decide which model is right for you.
Consult your doctor or audiologist for advice. Ask something like, “Can you recommend a model of hearing aid for me based on my goals?”;
, This model is molded to fit exactly into your ear canal, and is the smallest and least visible model available. It can help with mild to moderate hearing loss in adult populations.Pros: Other than being the least visible, it’s also less likely to pick up wind noise.

Cons: Uses smaller batteries that can be hard to handle and don’t last as long; doesn’t have extra features like volume control or directional microphone; the speaker can get clogged by earwax.

, This model is also custom designed to fit partly into your ear canal, and also improves mild to moderate hearing loss for adults. Like the CIC model, it’s less visible than larger styles (though more visible than the CICs), and sometimes the speaker can be clogged by earwax.Pros: Can include features that the CIC can’t accommodate, for instance feedback cancelling, wireless streaming with Bluetooth and other devices, and wax repellent in some models.

Cons: Those features may be hard to use and adjust because the device is so small, and not all features may be available.

, This model is designed in two ways – the full shell model is custom made to fit in most of the bowl-shaped part of your outer ear, and the half shell fits into the lower half. Both improve mild to severe hearing loss.Pros: Can include features like volume control that smaller models can’t accommodate; can be easier to manipulate because of larger size; has a longer battery life because the battery is larger.

Cons: More visible in the ear; might pick up more wind noise than smaller models; earwax can still clog the speaker.

, The BTE sits behind your ear, and hooks over the top of you ear with a tube connecting to an earpiece. The earpiece is custom-molded and sits in your ear canal. This is the classic model, and anyone can use it – it’s good for all ages and all levels of hearing loss.Pros: Can amplify sound better than other styles; almost anyone can use it.

Cons: Picks up more wind noise; larger and generally the most visible (though some newer models are sleeker and less visible than older models).

, Similar to the BTE, these models sit behind the ear and link to a speaker in the canal through a very small wire.Pros: The part behind your ear is less visible.

Cons: Is more susceptible to earwax clogging the speaker than traditional BTE models.

, Also similar to a BTE, this model sits behind the ear and connects to a speaker in the canal with a thin tube. It keeps the ear canal much more open, however. This lets low-frequency sound enter the ear more naturally, while amplifying high-frequency sound with the hearing aid.Pros: Good for mild to moderate hearing loss and less visible than other BTE models; doesn’t completely plug your ear canal, so your voice may sound more natural to you.

Cons: Can be harder to handle and adjust settings because of smaller parts.

Discuss optional features with your audiologist.,
Look into options to control environment noise.,
Check out battery options.,
Get a wax guard, especially if you use a smaller device.,
Choose a model with vents for improved comfort.,
Get a remote control for easier use.,
Look into options that improve your use of electronics.,
Get a device with variable programming for optimal flexibility.,
Consider the synchronization feature if you have multiple devices.",How to Compare Hearing Aids2," Some models have features than help you to hear better in specific situations. Not all of these will benefit you; it depends on your lifestyle and needs. Your doctor or audiologist can help you understand what type of hearing loss you have, whether or not your hearing loss is likely to progress or worsen, and which features might benefit you most.

, Models with directional microphones help your hearing aid pick up and amplify sound in front of you while limiting sounds coming from beside or behind you.Models with noise reduction can be helpful if you’re frequently in an environment with lots of background noise, like in a busy workplace setting. Other models have noise cancellation features to help block out background noise.


Some models allow you to move your directional microphone to focus in a specific direction.
Consider a feature to reduce wind noise if you’re often outside.

, Some models have rechargeable batteries, which means you don’t have to change the battery often. This may make it easier to use.If you’re using a traditional battery, consider how big the battery is – larger batteries are easier to handle and hold a charge longer, but tend to require larger, more visible devices.


Before you buy a model, practice changing the battery. You’ll feel whether it’s easy or challenging for you., Many models now come with wax guards, since there’s traditionally been such a problem with earwax clogging speakers. You’ll want to know how to remove and clean the wax guard and how often you need to do so.This is probably a good buy for any user, unless you have a model that has solved this problem a different way.

, Some hearing aid models have tiny vents in the ear molds that decrease the feeling that your ear is stuffed up, and might help improve your ability to understand speech.You may want this option if you’ve experienced discomfort with other models.

, If you want a device that’s easy to use, consider a model that has a remote control. This allows you to alter the volume and change features without having to touch the hearing aid., There are a number of features available that make it easier to use phones, TVs, computers, and other electronics with your hearing aid. These are usually just available in BTE models.If you frequently use electronics or have a particularly difficult time hearing people over the phone, on the TV, or in large group settings that use speakers, consider one of these options:Get telecoils to use with a telecoil-compatible phone. These improve your hearing on the phone by eliminating background noise. Telecoils also work by picking up some public signals like those in theatres or churches – when available, this can help you hear the movie, play, or speaker better.
Some hearing aids are Bluetooth-compatible and can sync with your cell phone, TV, or other electronics that use Bluetooth. Depending on the model, you might need an intermediate device to pick up the signal and relay it to your hearing aid – be sure to ask the seller how this works.
The direct audio input feature lets you use a cord to plug your hearing aid directly into a computer, music player, or TV.

, You can increase the use of your hearing aid with the variable programming feature. This lets you store multiple preprogrammed settings (like volume, noise control, and others) for different listening environments.For instance, you can have a setting for being outdoors, another for being in a crowded indoors area, and another for quiet spaces.

, If you use a hearing aid in both ears, consider simplifying matters with synchronization. This makes the two hearing aids work together, so that a change you make to one (volume, for instance) affects the other.This may not be helpful if your level of hearing loss is different in your two ears.

Choose a digital device.,
Listen to the sound of your own voice.,
Ask about what's included in the price.,
Have a trial period.,
Make sure your hearing aid is covered by a warranty.,
Think about your future.",How to Compare Hearing Aids3," Hearing aids can be either analog or digital. Both types of hearing aids will amplify sound, but the digital style converts sound to data, amplifies it, then converts back to analog. The analog style simply amplifies sound. Digital hearing aids are more precise and more popular.In fact, many companies are discontinuing production of analog models to focus on the digital brands. If possible, choose a digital model.

, Because wearing a hearing aid affects how you hear your own voice, listening to the sound of your voice can be a good way to compare different models. At the store or doctor’s office, try different models and recite the same paragraph a few times each – pay attention to how your own voice sounds between different devices., The average cost of a hearing aid varies from about $1,500 to several thousand dollars. While the cost of a hearing aid will undoubtedly play a role in your decision, it's important to understand what’s included in the price a company quotes you. Most importantly, make sure that the price includes creating a mold that fits in your ear precisely, as well as the cost of making adjustments should you find the hearing aid uncomfortable.Other expenses may include remote controls, accessories, and those optional features.
Your insurance may cover the cost of your hearing aid, or at least part of it. Medicare does not pay for hearing aids, but private insurance might cover all or part for adults and is usually required to pay for hearing aids for children – check with your insurance provider. You may also be able to get your hearing aid paid for by the Veterans Administration (VA) or a medical assistance program.

, You should be allowed a trial period, because it can take a little time to adjust to your device and decide if you like it. Be sure to find out what it costs to have a trial period and whether that cost counts towards the purchase price if you choose to buy the hearing aid. Also know if you get a refund if you choose to return it during the trial.


Get all of this in writing.

, Your warranty should cover parts and labor for a period of time. Some warranties also cover doctor visits.This varies depending on where you get your device, but consider warranties as you compare options.

, Remember that your hearing loss may worsen as you get older. Consider whether the model of hearing aid you get is adaptable if you need more power in the future.If not, you may end up needing to purchase a new hearing aid down the road.

Use cold therapy as part of PRICE.,
Use a gel pack.,
Apply a chemical cold pack.,
Find anything that is cold.,
Utilize a vapocoolant spray.,
Take an ice bath.,
Get an ice massage.,
Try a cryo/cuff.,
Prevent infection with medicated ice.",How to Apply Cold Therapy1," PRICE stands for Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Icing an injury just after it happens is important, and you should use every element of PRICE in conjunction with cold therapy. Every element of PRICE is useful in helping ice do its work, which is to reduce pain from swelling and inflammation.


In other words, choose one method of delivering cold therapy as part of your PRICE regimen.;
, A gel pack is a flexible plastic bag filled with a freezable gel. Even after being frozen, gel packs are still malleable and useful for placing over the injured area. Because of this flexible characteristic, gel packs can easily be molded over injured parts of the body.Gel packs are best kept in the freezer for storage so they can be removed and used instantly.
Gel packs are reusable and can simply be placed back in the freezer once you are done using them.
Use a thin cloth or towel between the skin and the gel pack to prevent frostbite.
You can make your own gel pack by freezing 2 cups of water and 1 cup of rubbing alcohol in a gallon plastic freezer bag., Chemical cold packs are useful for outdoor first aid because they are not frozen. Instead, you squeeze or bend the pack to break apart the chemicals inside. The mixture of water and ammonium nitrate creates a chemical reaction that instantly cools the pack.After bending or hitting the cold pack to mix the chemicals inside, a chemical cold pack can be applied the same as a frozen gel pack.
Chemical cold packs don’t have to be refrigerated, so they are useful for tossing into your bag when you are leaving the house. You can also include them in a first aid kit that you carry around.
Keep a thin cloth or towel with the chemical cold pack to prevent freezer burn on the skin.

, You are not limited to a gel pack or chemical cold pack. You can use anything in your freezer that can be safely applied to the body. You can use a plastic baggie filled with ice cubes. You can even use a bag of unopened frozen vegetables.Use the same principle you would use for a gel pack—use a thin towel between the ice pack and skin and return it to the freezer when you are done.
If you use frozen vegetables or other food, keep in mind the that it might thaw and become inedible. Be sure you are ok with this before using.
Stay away from frozen meat because as meat thaws, bacteria in raw meat can become active and transfer to the skin.
You can also use rigid frozen items like hard ice packs (as would be used in a food cooler) or a frozen water bottle, although these items may not be as effective since they can’t conform to every surface.

, Vapocoolant sprays are useful if you just need a fast cooling effect rather than long-term icing. These sprays evaporate very fast. They remove heat from the body as they evaporate, providing immediate but temporary relief. Vapocoolant sprays are often used in topical pain relief, such as associated with an IV or other needle insertion (like a vaccine shot), rather than as treatment for a sprain or muscle injury., Ice baths are useful for submerging injured joints or other body parts that are awkward to wrap, such as elbows, ankles, feet, and hands. You simply fill a container large enough for the injured body part with ice cubes and water. However, you should wrap the injury first to provide both compression and insulation from the cold.You might fill a bathtub, a clean cooler, or a large bucket to prepare an adequate ice bath.

, You may have heard of massages that use heat therapy to warm up muscles for pain relief. An ice massage, however, seeks to accomplish the opposite effect. Ice numbs sore muscles like an analgesic would, as well as reduces inflammation and swelling. Massage contributes to this effect by manipulating the soft tissues.An ice massage therapist will take a ball of ice and place it inside a plastic wand so that they can push the ice along your muscles without freezing their hands or fingers.

, If you need compression with cold therapy, a cryo/cuff provides both. It is a sleeve you slip onto an injured limb, and an attached pouch is filled with cold water. A tube going from a tank to the sleeve pumps the sleeve full of cold water. The water should be cycled out of the cuff every one or two hours.


Cryo/cuffs are useful after surgery to joints and limbs for pain relief.

, If you have an abrasion on top of an injury, using ice treated with an antiseptic like iodine or chlorhexidine is useful. Putting the treated ice directly on the skin will allow transfer of the medication, which may prevent infection in the skin opening.These preparations may also contain lidocaine, which is a anesthetic which can stop pain in the area.For example, you could freeze a popsicle mold, ice cube tray, or other container fill with water mixed with 10% povidone-iodine and 2% lidocaine with a popsicle stick stuck it in. When you need it, you can grab the popsicle stick and rub the medicated ice over the sore to provide both pain relief and infection prevention. Keep the medicated ice moving or rolling along the injury to prevent damage to the skin. Only do this for 10 minutes or less."

Consider using calamine lotion.,
Apply the lotion.,
Talk to your doctor before using calamine lotion if you are pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant, or are breastfeeding.,
Consider using tacrolimus ointment.,
Apply Tacrolimus ointment.",How to Deal with Itchy Skin when on Dialysis1," Calamine lotion, which includes products like lanolin or Aquaphor, is designed to treat and prevent dry, rough, scaly, and itchy skin. Calamine lotion contains emollients, which help to soften and moisturize the skin while decreasing itching and flaking.Check the contents of calamine lotion or creams before buying. Do not use these products if you are allergic to one of the ingredients found in the lotion.;
, Check the product label for instruction and the correct usage. In general, to use calamine lotion you should shake it well before using it. Put a dab of the lotion on a soft, clean cloth for easy application. Apply the lotion to the affected ares of your skin as often as you need to, or as directed by your doctor.Apply the product after bathing or showering, while the skin is still damp.
Such creams and lotions are for external use only. Avoid contact with your eyes and other mucous membranes.
Ask your pediatrician before using calamine lotion on children younger than six months old.

, Some of the chemicals found in calamine lotion may not be safe to use during pregnancy, or may interfere with conception.


Additionally consult your doctor if you are taking any prescription or nonprescription medicine, herbal preparation, or dietary supplements because the lotion could cause an interaction with the drugs you are already taking.

, Tacrolimus ointment seems to be a safe and highly effective short‐term treatment option for patients suffering from severe itchy skin caused by dialysis. However, considering the potentially carcinogenic effect of systemically administered tacrolimus, you should not use this lotion over long periods of time.Consult your physician if you have existing skin infections (eg, chickenpox, herpes, shingles) at the application site, or certain skin problems (such as a precancerous skin condition, skin cancer, or Netherton syndrome).
There are certain medications that interact with this kind of cream, so consult your doctor before use. Certain calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem), cimetidine, erythromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, or ketoconazole may increase the risk of tacrolimus ointment's side effects in certain patients.
Like other creams and lotions ask your physician if you should use Tacrolimus ointment if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breast-feeding.

, Read the instructions that come with the ointment. You will most likely be prompted to dry your skin completely after a bath or shower before applying tacrolimus ointment. Wash your hands before using tacrolimus ointment. Apply a thin layer of the ointment to the affected area or your skin; do not apply it to any other parts of your skin. Gently rub the medicine in until it is evenly distributed. Wash your hands after applying tacrolimus ointment (if your hands are not an area of treatment).Do not bathe, shower, or swim right after applying tacrolimus ointment. Doing these activities could wash off the ointment. Do not cover the treated area with bandages or other dressings or wraps, unless otherwise directed by your doctor.
Tacrolimus ointment is for external use only. Do not get tacrolimus ointment in your eyes, nose, or mouth.
If you miss a dose of tacrolimus ointment, use it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not use two doses at once.

Use PRICE for an acute injury.,
Protect the injury.,
Rest the injured body part.,
Ice the injury.,
Apply compression.,
Elevate the painful area.",How to Apply Cold Therapy2," Ice is most useful for treating an acute injury and less useful for treating recurring pain (or chronic pain). This is because the purpose of cold therapy is to quickly reduce pain from inflammation and swelling, both of which are present in an acute injury and usually lacking with chronic pain.Heat is better for chronic pain.
You may add heat to an acute injury only after using just cold therapy for a few days.
This is because heat increases blood flow, which is opposite of what you want to do to reduce pain after an injury. After a few days of cold therapy, pain is greatly reduced.

, Using ice as a component of the PRICE method for injuries will reduce pain and swelling, perhaps even shorten healing time. The first step of PRICE is protection, wherein you should stop moving the injured tissue by using a crutch or splint.Protecting the injury prevents damaging your body even more.

, After limiting the mobility of the injury, it is important for the injured person to find a safe place to rest in the short term. In the long term, that means not using the injured body part very much until it is fully healed.


For instance, if you injure your wrist, you should avoid heavy lifting and activities that require wrist flexion until pressure no longer causes pain, or at least 1 to 2 days.

, You can use cold therapy (a.k.a. cryotherapy) as part of the RICE method in the form of ice cubes, or any of the cold therapy methods—ice packs, frozen vegetables, frozen water bottles, ice baths, ice massages, and so on. Leave the ice on for 15-20 minutes at a time, then remove it for the same amount of time before reapplying the ice.


You should use this 15 on/15 off method as often as possible the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury.

, Compression is useful in combination with ice to reduce swelling and inflammation. It should be employed the first one to two days after an injury. Compression narrows blood vessels to reduce swelling and excess bleeding.Compression can be achieved by wrapping an injury in an ace bandage or using a compression sleeve as found in a cryo/cuff setup.

, On top of resting, using ice, and employing compression, elevating the injury helps the healing process. Elevation allows gravity to drain fluids from the injury site, thereby reducing inflammation and swelling. Reduction in fluids can also mean reduction in pain.Keep lower limbs elevated above the hips.
Keep upper limbs elevated in a sling or on a pillow.
Elevation should be a top priority for the first 2 days after an injury.

"
"
Understand how cold therapy works.,
Apply ice after an acute injury.,
Use ice for a short amount of time.,
Hold off on using heat.",How to Apply Cold Therapy3," The basic point of cryotherapy, or cold therapy, is to reduce pain and prevent further damage to an injured area.This is achieved by cutting off swelling and inflammation, which compress nerve endings. Ice numbs a localized injury by narrowing the blood vessels and slowing blood flow to the injury.The other tenets of the PRICE method also seek to reduce blood flow to the injury, such as resting, compressing the blood vessels, and using elevation to keep fluids from gathering at the injury site.

, Many times people don’t know whether to reach for heat or cold therapy after an injury. The basic rule of thumb is that heat helps muscles relax, while cold reduces inflammation and pain.Therefore cold therapy is best for acute injuries, and heat therapy is best for chronic injuries.Acute injuries are those that arise from an accident or traumatic physical incident, such as falling down or bumping into someone in a sports game.
Chronic injuries are those that have built up over time and are usually caused by overuse, such as tendonitis.

, Because cold therapy is for inflammation and swelling, both of which decrease over time, it is best to use cold therapy for the first few days after an injury before alternating with heat. Remember to apply ice for a maximum of 20 minutes, letting your skin rest for 10 to 20 minutes between applications., After you have used cold therapy diligently for two to three days and the inflammation has gone down, is it ok to add heat therapy. You can alternate heat and cold by applying cold therapy for 10 minutes followed by 10 minutes of heat. This alternation increases blood flow to the injury, which speeds healing.Heat therapy can be found in a hot water bottle, heating pad, warm wet towel, and so on. Keep a layer of cloth between the skin and hot water bottle to prevent burning.

Avoid using very hot water.,
Steer clear of fragrant soaps.,
Make a cornstarch and baking soda bath.,
Apply soothing lotions after your bath.",How to Deal with Itchy Skin when on Dialysis2," Taking a refreshing bath at least once a day may be helpful for relieving skin itchiness and irritation. However, make sure the water you use is merely warm rather than hot, as hot water can dry your skin out further, thus causing more irritation and itchiness., Stick to soaps that are hypoallergenic, as these are especially designed for sensitive skin. Artificially fragrant soaps may cause your skin to become irritated.

, Fill your bath-tub with warm water. Instead of using soap, simply add one half to one full cup of baking soda and a half or full cup of cornstarch to your prepared bath. Baking soda and cornstarch baths decrease itching and will dry your skin less than soap will.


You can add bath salts (Epsom or sea salt) to enhance your bath experience.
Soak in the bath for at least 15 to 20 minutes, unless told otherwise by your doctor.
Between baths, use cold compresses to apply pressure to itchy sites.

, Dry your skin thoroughly and apply one of the lotions discussed in the previous step to help keep your skin itch-free in between baths.

Consider sunlight or ultraviolet photo therapy.,
Pick the best time for sun exposure.,
Protect your skin from sun damage during your photo therapy sessions.,
Wear loose-fitting garments.,
Control your intake of phosphorus.",How to Deal with Itchy Skin when on Dialysis3," Sunlight, or ultraviolet light, photo therapy is thought to be able to relieve skin itchiness. However, effects seem to vary according to each patient’s individual condition.Our bodies need natural sunlight to synthesize vitamin D in our skin. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. It is found in food, but also can be made by exposing your body to ultraviolet rays from the sun. The major biological function of vitamin D is to maintain normal blood levels of calcium and phosphorus (both of which can make you feel itchy).

, Getting at least some early morning direct sunlight is beneficial even, for people who are not undergoing dialysis. However, the highest levels of ultraviolet (UV) light occur between the hours of 9 AM and 3 PM; you should avoid getting direct sunlight without some form of skin protection during these hours. Because of this, you should aim to get sun exposure 10 minutes before 9 AM or in the late afternoon, after 5 PM.The amount of sunlight you need to make vitamin D depends on a range of factors such as the UV level, your skin type, and your lifestyle. For example, to obtain the same production of Vitamin D, the exposure to sunlight must be six times longer for a darker skinned compared to a fairer skinned person.

, The same UV light that helps to synthesize vitamin D can also lead to sunburn and other skin conditions. Because of this, try not to remain outdoors for longer than 15 minutes without sun protection, such as protective lotions. Wear sunscreen on areas that are not affected by itchiness.Use hypoallergenic lotions or creams without SPF content to keep your skin moisturized during sun exposure. Remember if the moisturizer you use has an SPF value, it will block UVB rays, which help to sensitize vitamin D in your skin, so only apply SPF cream to areas that are not affected.

, Lighter fabrics like cotton promote air circulation, and can help to absorb body moisture. They also work to draw heat away from your body.


At the same time, wearing loose clothes can help to prevent direct skin irritation caused by clothes rubbing against your skin.

, Since dialysis does not effectively remove phosphorus, a renal diet that limits foods high in phosphorous is prescribed. In addition to controlling how much phosphorus is in your renal diet, remember to take phosphorus binders with every meal (this is discussed in the next section). Foods rich in phosphorus include:


Dairy products like cheese, milk, and cream soups.
Protein like beef liver and oysters.
Baked, lima, and soy beans.

"
"
Take antihistamines.,
Consider phosphate binders.,
Take phosphate binders with a meal.",How to Deal with Itchy Skin when on Dialysis4," Histamine causes allergic and inflammatory reactions. This can lead to itchy skin. Antihistamines block the receptor that the histamine has to bind to to create these reactions, thereby keeping you from feeling itchy.Take antihistamine medications with meals to minimize stomach upset.
Antihistamines may cause drowsiness, so you may wish to take them at night. There are also non-drowsy versions of the same medications. These drugs may also cause your mouth to feel dry.
Avoid alcohol drinking while taking this drug. Antihistamines increase the sedative effect of alcohol.

, Phosphate binders, also known as calcium acetate, are used to control high phosphate levels in patients with renal disease without promoting aluminum absorption. However, this medication requires a physician prescription. Your doctor will give you a specific dosage based on the amount of control you need over your phosphate and calcium levels.Do not take these medications within 1 to 2 hours of other medications if possible. This is to avoid drug to drug interaction with other medications. However, administer stool softeners and laxatives as prescribed because phosphate binders are constipating.

, Taking calcium acetate with food reduces the absorption of phosphorus, which is the goal of taking this medication. Therefore, calcium acetate should be taken with a meal.Do not take this medication with foods containing phosphorous (especially milk or dairy products). Avoid foods containing oxalic acid (rhubarb, spinach), or phytic acid (bran, whole cereals) because they interfere with calcium absorption.
Avoid drinking alcohol or caffeinated beverages because they interfere calcium absorption.

Start at the foot.,
Wrap in a figure-8 pattern over the ankle.,
Continue wrapping up the leg.,
Check the tightness.,
Apply an ace bandage if you have a muscle or joint injury.,
Watch for signs of improvement.,
Call your doctor if you have an infected wound.,
Wash the wraps after use.,
Protect the wraps from damaging substances.,
Replace the wraps when necessary.",How to Ace Wrap a Leg," Use a bandage that is four inches wide for the foot. Start with the wrap rolled up and unwind it as you go. Wrap in a diagonal, criss-cross pattern as follows:Begin wrapping over the top of the foot near the toes. Wrap under the foot to secure the bandage. When wrapping over the foot, you should be moving out towards the outside of your foot. When continuing to wrap under your foot, you should be moving in towards the inside of your foot.Pull the bandage so that is diagonal. It should not be at a 90 degree angle to your foot; instead, wrap at a 30 degree angle. Each time you wrap, reverse the direction of the diagonal to make a criss-cross pattern, not a spiral. Instead, it should look more like a herringbone pattern.
You want to overlap the bandages a bit on either side of the foot to provide the extra support. The herringbone weave should ideally run right up the midline of the foot as you go — this provides pressure and support in all the right places.
Do not wrap the middle of your leg without wrapping your foot.;
, After wrapping over the top of your foot, continue around your heel. Continue wrapping around to the front and over the top of your ankle towards the outside of your foot.The next time around your ankle will make an X on the front of your ankle. Wrap from underneath the inside of your heel, up and across the front to the bottom of your calf on the outside of your leg.

, Keep working in a criss-cross pattern over the ankle and above, keeping the herringbone running up the midline as best you can.Wrap less tightly as you go over the calf and even looser at the knee. Take care that the bandage lays flat. If there are wrinkles it will create pressure points and irritate you.When you get to the thigh, you may want to change to using a larger bandage. For adults, you can use a bandage that is six inches wide. For children and small adults, you may simply use another four inch bandage.
If you find it too difficult to wrap in a criss-cross pattern over your calf and thigh, you can wrap those areas using a circular pattern. If you do this, change to wrapping in circles just above your ankle. Each new layer should overlap the previous by 1/3 to 1/2 the width of the bandage.Secure the wrap with a clip when you are finished.

, The wrap should be tightest on your foot, looser on your calf, and loosest over your knee and thigh. It should not hurt and you should be able to fit a finger snugly underneath. Examine your toes, if you squeeze them, you should see the blood rapidly return to the tissue as soon as you release them. If your toes show the following signs, the wrap is too tight:Swelling
Lack of color or bluish tinge
Numbness
Tingling

, If you are unsure whether a compression wrap would be beneficial or if you are unsure how to wrap it, see your doctor. Your doctor can advise you on what would be best for your particular injury and how exactly you should apply the wrap. Both strains and sprains can benefit from wrapping.A strain occurs when your muscles or tendons stretch or tear. Tendons attach your muscles to your bones.
A sprain occurs when your ligaments stretch or tear. Ligaments run between bones.

, Compression wraps serve multiple purposes for promoting healing. They are best used when you have to stay mobile while you heal your injury. Checking the bandage to make sure it isn't impeding blood flow at least a couple of times a day is useful. They can help by:Reducing pain.
Limiting swelling.
Protecting the injured area.

, If you are unsure whether you might have an infection, you should still call the doctor and ask if he or she would like to see you. Signs of an infection include:A wound that gives off a bad odor or leaks pus.
Skin that is hot, swollen, and red, or has red streaks running from the wound site.
A fever.

, They are reusable, but they must be kept clean. Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Most types are machine washable.Place them in a hosiery bag so they don’t get tangled in the machine. Use a gentle cycle and a mild soap. If you put them in the dryer use a low setting so that the elastic maintains its stretchiness.
If you do not use a dryer, lay them flat to dry. Do not wring them out or hang them. This will stretch them out.

, Some substances may cause the elastic or the fibers of the wrap to degrade. Do not use the following products on your skin when using wraps:Vaseline
Lotions and ointments with petroleum

, Depending upon how much use they get, most wraps will need to be replaced after one or two months.If the wrap is no longer as stretchy as it was when you bought it, this is a sign that it needs to be replaced.
Wraps with tears or holes should also be replaced as this creates an uneven amount of pressure on your skin.

Protect yourself from insurance companies.",How to Act After a Car Accident," You will likely be angry, scared, shocked, nervous, guilty, or a combination of all of these emotions in the aftermath of an accident. The calmer you are, the better you will be able to deal with the situation. Take a few deep breaths or count to ten to steady yourself., Leaving the scene of an accident, whether you caused the accident or not, can result in serious criminal penalties. The penalties for leaving an injured person at the scene vary from state to state and according to the extent of the injuries, but generally result in fines between $5,000 and $20,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years, in addition to civil damages. Leaving the scene after even minor damage can result in your license being suspended., The most important thing to do immediately after a car accident is to assess any injuries you or the other drivers and passengers have received. Determine your own safety, then check with the other people involved and, if necessary, immediately call for an ambulance.If someone is unconscious or has neck pain, moving them may cause serious harm. Leave them in place until medical personnel arrives, unless leaving them in place would endanger them (i.e. they are lying in traffic, their car is on fire, etc.).

, Even for what looks like a fender-bender, it is still a good idea to call. That way you will have an official record of the accident, which will help protect you in case the other party sues you or disputes your account of the accident.Police can also dispatch assistance in the event of a serious accident.


Stay on the phone with the police until they arrive or instruct you to hang up. Many 911 operators can provide safety instructions.Ask that a police report be filed. This report will help when filing insurance claims and in the event of a lawsuit.In some states, police will only file a report if injuries are involved. In this case, file a state vehicle accident report, available at police stations or on the Department of Motor Vehicles website.Obtain the name and badge numbers of the police who arrive, in case your insurance agent or lawyer needs to contact them., If you can safely drive your vehicle, move it off to the side of the road and out of the path of oncoming traffic. This will keep you at a safe distance from traffic while you exchange information with the other drivers and make it easier for police and ambulance workers to reach the scene of the accident., Particularly on the highway, anything you can do to alert oncoming traffic that there is a disabled vehicle in the road will increase your safety., Don’t try to cross traffic to get off the road, and don’t stand next to a car that is stranded in traffic or on the shoulder. People who get out of their car are killed or injured more often than those who stay inside.However, if you smell gas, get out of your car right away. This could signal a fuel leak that could lead to a fire or explosion., Get the names and phone numbers of all the other drivers involved in the traffic accident. Write down the make, model, year and license plate number of each vehicle. Be sure to obtain all insurance information including the company, policy number and any insurance agent contact information the driver can provide.Be polite, but do not apologize. If you say, “I’m so sorry I hit you,” you may be admitting legal liability for the accident. Try not to admit guilt unnecessarily like this, as it may not be clear who was at fault in the immediate aftermath.Be wary of identity theft. Criminals sometimes stage fender-benders in order to obtain the information needed to steal another motorist’s identity.
Never give out your social security number or let another driver take a picture of your driver’s license. For safety reasons, don’t provide your home address, either.

, Obtain names and contact information for any witnesses of the accident. Write down their account of what happened and make sure they agree to let your attorney or insurance agent contact and question them. They may be helpful if the other driver disputes your account of the accident.

, Photograph damage to your car and the other vehicles involved in the accident. Also take photos of the accident location and the people involved. This will help document the damage when you submit an accident claim to your insurance company. It will also help protect you in the event the other motorist claims more serious injury or car damage than actually occurred., Immediately report the car accident to your insurance company. Also provide the insurance company with information on the other driver. Immediately filing a claim will speed up the process of getting your car repaired and securing a rental vehicle, if necessary. Do not lie when stating the facts of the accident, as this can result in denial of your coverage.The other driver may suggest not filing claims in the event of a small accident, as filing a claim will raise your rates. However, it is always a good idea to file a claim to protect yourself. The other driver may later change his mind and file a claim, even claiming injuries that weren’t apparent at the time of the accident. You want to be sure your insurance company has your version of the accident as soon as possible., Particularly if anyone was hurt in the accident, hiring a lawyer is a good idea. A lawyer can help you maximize your reward if you have been injured, or defend you if the other motorist was injured., Keep records of any hospital visits, tests, prescriptions or other expenses that arise as a result of your auto accident. This information will be needed by your insurance company and attorney.

, If the accident impacts your life to the extent that you decide to file a personal injury suit, you can claim damages for mental and physical distress and/or lost wages, as well as medical treatment. Keep a diary of how the injuries impact your life, including missed workdays, routine activities you cannot undertake, and changes to you family life., This will determine how much your company, or the other motorist's company if they were at fault, is willing to pay to replace or fix your car. If you think the number is too low, get your own independent estimates, and then discuss them with your adjuster., Certainly the other motorist’s company, and perhaps your own, may not have your best interests at heart.If the other motorist’s insurance company calls you, politely refuse to discuss the accident with them and mention the call to your own insurance company or lawyer.
If your company offers you an early settlement, do not sign it until you are sure you will be compensated for all your injuries. Some injuries – particularly back and neck ones caused by whiplash – might not show up or reach their maximum level of pain until weeks or even months after the accident.

Wipe down the non-disposable filter.,
Reassemble your machine and check for leaks.",How to Clean a CPAP2," Disassemble the mask, frame, fabric backstrap, and tubing. Fill a clean sink or wash basin with warm water and a few drops of mild soap. Submerge your equipment in the sink or basin, gently swish them around with your hand, and let them soak for five minutes.When you have a cold or flu, you should wash all of your equipment daily until your symptoms are gone.

, You can use a soft bristle brush to remove or prevent mold and bacterial growth inside the tube. Use a soft baby bottle brush or look online or at your sleep center for a specially designed CPAP tube cleaning brush.Gently rub the tube’s interior with the brush and be careful not to cut through the delicate material between the coils.  

, You can just air dry your mask and headgear on a towel, but you must hang your tubing to dry it. Shake off excess water and manually dry the exterior with a towel. Hang the tube on the shower rod, hook, hanger, or a laundry rack to make sure all the water drips out., Many CPAP machines come with two filters: a non-disposable, grey or black foam filter and white, fine replaceable filter. Remove the grey or black foam filter and hand wash it with warm water and mild soap. Squeeze excess water out of it, blot it with a dry towel, then let it air dry.Don’t wash the white fine filter. Replace it monthly or when it appears discolored. Replace the grey or black filter at least yearly.

, Put your mask, headgear, and tubing back together when they're dry. Fix the headgear frame and backstrap to the mask, reattach the mask to the tube, and connect the tube to the humidifier or CPAP machine. Turn the machine on and listen for any leaks that weren't there before cleaning.Check your user manual for more specific information about reassembling your machine.
Have your equipment provider check your machine if you hear any leaks or if you use it and don't think it's working correctly.

Wash out the humidifier tub after each use.,
Disinfect the tub every two weeks.,
Check your humidifier at least monthly for deterioration.",How to Clean a CPAP3," Empty out any unused water from the humidifier chamber each morning. Hand wash the tub with a mild soap and warm distilled water. Rinse it well to remove all soapy residue, then let it air dry on a clean towel away from direct sunlight., Every other week, give your humidifier tub a sanitizing bath in a vinegar and distilled water solution. Mix together one part vinegar and five parts distilled water and soak your tub in the solution for 30 minutes. Rinse it well, then let it air dry away from direct sunlight.Using distilled water for the soaking solution will help cut down mineral deposits, which can damage your machine.

, Check the tub for any signs of wear, deterioration, or mineral deposits at least once a month. Replace the tub if any surfaces are cloudy, pitted, or cracked.You should replace your humidifier tub once or twice per year."

Do not remove objects embedded in the skin.,
Keep the patient in a resting position.,
Monitor the patient.,
Remove the object (or objects) if it is not large.,
Clean dirt and other small particles from the surface of the wound.,
Treat and bandage the wound.,
Treat the affected area with care.,
Monitor the puncture for infection.,
Get a tetanus shot if needed.",How to Treat a Puncture Wound," Provided a puncture wound is attended to quickly, it will usually not become serious. If left unattended, however, infection introduced through the puncture site can become life-threatening for the patient., This is especially important for children and for people who don't cope very well with pain. Have him sit or lay down, and help him to remain calm while you treat the wound.

, This will prevent infection.Clean any instruments you might use during treatment with rubbing alcohol. These may include tweezers., Cleanse the wound under warm water for between five and 15 minutes, and then wash the wound with soap and a clean cloth. , Minor puncture wounds usually do not bleed profusely.Use a clean cloth to apply gentle, direct pressure on the wound until the bleeding stops.


A small amount of bleeding may actually help to clean the wound. You can allow small wounds to bleed for about five minutes.If the bleeding continues after several minutes of pressure, or the bleeding is severe, ongoing, or alarms you, seek medical attention immediately., Look at the size and depth of the wound, and check for foreign objects embedded in the skin. Larger puncture wounds may require stitches. If you observe any of the following signs, call or visit an emergency medical facility as soon as possible:


The bleeding won’t stop after five to 10 minutes.
The wound is a quarter of an inch or more deep. Even if you can stop the bleeding, larger wounds should be treated by a professional.
An object is embedded deeply into the skin. If you can’t see anything, but suspect an object remains in the wound, seek medical attention.
The patient stepped on a nail, or the wound was caused by a rusty fishhook or other rusty object.
A person or animal has bitten the patient. Bites are prone to infection.
The affected area is numb or the patient cannot move the body part normally.
The wound shows signs of infection, including redness and swelling around the affected area, increasing pain or a throbbing sensation, pus or other discharge, or the patient experiences chills or a fever (see Part 4)., Call emergency services or a close-by emergency medical center. Major puncture wounds should only be treated by a medical professional.

, If the bleeding is severe and you do not have access to a clean cloth or bandage, use your hand., Keep the affected area raised above the patient’s heart, if possible. This will help to bring the bleeding under control., Instead, apply a thick padding of bandages or clean cloth around the foreign object. Make sure there is as little pressure as possible on the embedded object. , To help slow the bleeding, the patient should be kept at total rest for at least 10 minutes. , While you wait for medical assistance to arrive, monitor the wound and the patient’s condition.


Keep pressure on the wound and replace bandages if they become soaked with blood.Calm the patient until medical assistance arrives.

, Small splinters and other sharp objects can be removed with disinfected tweezers. If you find a large object, or one that is embedded deeply into the flesh, seek medical attention., Rub the wound with a clean cloth and/or remove the particles with disinfected tweezers.All manner of foreign objects can become embedded in a puncture wound, including wood, cloth, rubber, dirt and other materials; these may be difficult or impossible to see when treating the wound at home. However, do not poke or dig around in the wound; if you believe there are still foreign objects in the wound, seek medical attention. , If the puncture is free of debris and sharp objects, apply an antibacterial ointment or cream and cover with a bandage. Because minor puncture wounds do not tend to be very large in size and are not prone to excessive bleeding, you may not need a bandage. However, puncture wounds to the feet or other places that get dirty may require a bandage to prevent debris from entering the wound.
Topical antibiotic ointments like Neosporin and Polysporin are effective, and don’t require a prescription. Apply every 12 hours for 2 days. Use a porous adhesive dressing or bandage that won’t stick to the wound. Change daily, to ensure that the wound stays healthy and dry. , The following steps are recommended for the first 48 to 72 hours after treating a minor puncture:


Keep the affected area elevated, above the heart if possible.
Change the bandages if they get dirty or wet.
Keep the affected area dry for 24 to 48 hours.
After 24 to 48 hours, clean the wound with soap and water twice a day. You can reapply antibiotic ointment or cream, but avoid the use of rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide.
Avoid activities that may place a strain on the affected area and could re-open the wound. , Minor puncture wounds should heal in less than two weeks. If you notice any of the following symptoms, seek medical assistance immediately:


Throbbing or increasing pain in the affected area.
Redness or swelling of the wound. In particular, look for red streaks around or moving away from the wound.
Pus or other discharge.
An unpleasant smell coming from the wound.
Chills, or a fever of 100.4°F (38°C).
Swelling in the neck, armpits or groin glands. , A wound that has come into contact with soil, manure or dirt may pose a risk of a tetanus infection. Use the following guidelines to determine if the patient needs a tetanus shot (and consult your doctor for advice):


If more than 10 years have passed since the patient last had a tetanus shot.
If the object causing the injury was dirty (or you are not sure whether or not it was dirty), or the wound is severe, and more than 5 years have passed since the patient last had a tetanus shot.
The patient is not sure when the last shot was.
The patient has never received a tetanus shot."

Profuse sweating or moist skin
Bluish lips and fingernails
Rapid and weak pulse
Rapid and shallow breathing
Enlarged or contracted pupils (pupils can enlarge in septic shock, but can constrict in traumatic shock)
Low blood pressure
Low or no urine output
If the person is conscious, he or she will display an altered mental status such as being disoriented, confused, anxious, agitated, dizzy, lightheaded, or feel faint, weak, or fatigued
The person may complain of chest pain, nausea, and experience vomiting
Losing consciousness follows;
, Shock is a medical emergency, will require expert medical attention, and hospitalization.You may save the person’s life by ensuring that paramedics are on the way while you initiate treatment.
If possible, stay on the line with the emergency services dispatcher to continually provide updates about the person’s condition.
Follow the instructions provided by the dispatcher until emergency medical help arrives.

, Make sure the airway is clear, be sure the person is breathing, and check for a pulse.Observe the person's chest to see if it rises and falls, and place your cheek next to the person’s mouth to check for breath.
Continue to monitor the person’s respiration rate at least every 5 minutes, even if they are breathing on their own., If blood pressure equipment should be available and can be used without causing further injury, monitor the person’s blood pressure and report it to the dispatcher.

, Only administer CPR if you are trained to do so. An untrained person may do serious harm to someone by attempting CPR.Only trained people should administer CPR to adults, children, and infants, due to the risk of serious and life-threatening injury.
The American Red Cross has recently implemented new protocols for administering CPR. It is important that only people trained in the new methods, and in the use of an AED if available, take charge of administering those procedures., If the person is conscious and has no injury to the head, leg, neck, or spine, then proceed with placing them in the shock position.Position the person on their back and elevate the legs about 12 inches.Do not elevate the head.If raising the legs causes pain, or possible harm, then do not elevate the legs and leave the person lying in a flat position., Treat the person where they are unless the surrounding area is dangerous.


For safety reasons, you may need to carefully move the person and yourself out of harm’s way. Examples include being located on a highway at the scene of a car accident or near an unstable structure that may collapse or explode.
Do not let the person eat or drink anything., If the person sustained a trauma, you may need to stop the flow of blood from a wound or provide first aid for a broken bone.Apply pressure to any bleeding wounds and dress the wounds using clean materials if available., Cover the person with any available material such as towels, jackets, blankets, or first aid blankets., Loosen any tight fitting clothing such as belts, buttoned pants at the waist, or any tight clothing around the chest area.Loosen collars, remove neckties, and unbutton or cut away tight clothing.
Loosen shoes and remove any tight or constrictive jewelry if on the person's wrists or neck., Do not wait to see if symptoms progress to evaluate the person’s condition, initiate treatment, and monitor their progress or decline..Talk to the person calmly. If the person is conscious, talking to them can help you to continue to evaluate their condition.Continue to provide updates to the dispatcher on the person’s level of consciousness, their respirations, and pulse.

, Check and maintain a clear airway, monitor their breathing, and keep check on their circulation by checking the pulse.


Monitor their level of consciousness every few minutes until the paramedics arrive., If the person vomits or is bleeding from the mouth, and there is no suspicion of spinal injury, turn the person onto their side to keep the airway clear and prevent choking.If spinal injury is suspected and the person is vomiting or bleeding from the mouth, clear the airway if possible without moving their head, back, or neck.Place your hands on each side of the person’s face and gently lift their jaw and open the mouth with your fingertips to clear the airway. Be careful not to move their head and neck.If you cannot clear their airway, get help to use a log-rolling maneuver to roll them onto their side to prevent choking.One person should try to keep the head and neck supported and in line with the back as a straight unit, while another person gently rolls the injured person onto their side., The reaction begins within seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. Symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction include the following:Pale skin, possibly flushed or reddened areas, hives, itching, and swelling at the site of exposure.Feeling of warmth.Difficulty swallowing, sensation of having a lump in your throat.Difficulty breathing, coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness or discomfort.Swelling of the tongue and mouth area, nasal congestion, and facial swelling.Dizziness, light headedness, anxiousness, and slurred speech.Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.Palpitations, and a weak and rapid pulse., Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency, will require expert medical attention, and possibly hospitalization.Anaphylaxis can lead to death if it is not treated immediately. Stay on the line with emergency services for further instructions as you administer treatment.
Do not delay in seeking emergency medical treatment, even if symptoms appear mild. In some cases, the reaction may be mild at first, then reach a serious and life-threatening level several hours after exposure.The initial reaction involves swelling and itching at the site of exposure. For an insect sting, this will occur on the skin. For a food or drug allergy, the swelling will likely begin in the mouth and throat area, which can quickly interrupt the ability to breathe., Ask the person if they have an epinephrine autoinjector, such as an EpiPen. The shot is usually administered in the thigh.This is a shot that administers a dose of life-saving epinephrine to slow down the reaction, and is frequently carried by people with known food and bee sting allergies.Do not assume this injection will be enough to completely stop the reaction. Proceed with treatment accordingly, including seeking emergency medical attention., Try to determine the cause of the reaction.Common allergies that can cause life-threatening anaphylactic reactions include bee or wasp stings, insect bites or stings such as fire ants, food items including peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, and soy or wheat products.
If the person is unable to speak or respond, check for a medical alert necklace, bracelet, or wallet card.If the cause is from an insect or bee sting, scrape the stinger from the skin using something firm, like a fingernail, key, or credit card.Do not remove the stinger with tweezers. This will squeeze more venom into the skin., Position the person flat on the ground or floor. Do not place a pillow under their head since this can interfere with their breathing.Do not give the person anything to eat or drink.Raise their feet about 12 inches off the ground, and cover the person with something warm such as a coat or blanket.Loosen any restrictive clothing such as belts, neck ties, buttoned pants, collars or shirts, shoes, and jewelry around the neck or wrist.
If an injury is suspected to the head, neck, back, or spine, do not raise their legs, just let the person remain flat on the ground or floor., To prevent choking and maintain their airway, roll the person on their side if they begin to vomit or if you notice blood in the mouth.Take precaution to prevent further damage if a spine injury is suspected. Get help to gently log-roll the person onto his or her side by keeping the head, neck, and back in as straight a line as possible., Even if the person is breathing on their own, continue to monitor the rate of respirations and the pulse rate every few minutes.Also monitor the person’s level of consciousness every few minutes until the paramedics arrive., Only administer CPR if you are trained to do so. An untrained person may do serious harm to someone by attempting CPR.Only trained people should administer CPR to adults, children, and infants, due to the risk of serious and life-threatening injury.
The American Red Cross has recently implemented new protocols for administering CPR. It is important that only people trained in the new methods, and in the use of an AED if available, take charge of administering those procedures., Continue to talk to the person in a calm and reassuring manner, monitor their condition, and watch closely for changes.

, Rinse it with clean water. This will help to remove dirt and other particles that might cause an infection. Wash the skin around the wound with soap and a clean washcloth. Gently pat the wound and surrounding tissues dry.If running water is not able to remove all of the debris from the wound, you may need to remove it with tweezers. Wash and then sterilize the tweezers with rubbing alcohol before touching them to the wound. Then gently remove any foreign particles embedded in the wound. If you cannot remove them all, go to the emergency room and have a doctor help you.
If the wound has an object embedded in it, do not remove it. Instead, go to the doctor so that it can be removed safely without causing additional damage.
Do not wipe the wound with a cotton ball that might leave pieces of material stuck in the wound. This increases the risk of infection and may complicate healing.

, After you have stopped the bleeding and cleaned the wound, apply an antibiotic cream to protect it from infection. You can purchase antibiotic creams and ointments such as Neosporin or Polysporin over-the-counter at your local pharmacy.Use these ointments for one to two days.


Always read and follow the instructions on the packaging. If you are pregnant, nursing, or treating a child, consult your doctor before using any medications.
Do not apply an antiseptic disinfectant like alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. This can harm the tissues and make it take longer to heal.

, This will prevent bacteria and dirt from entering the wound. Depending upon where the wound is located, a simple adhesive bandage may be sufficient. If the wound is larger or located near a joint, you may need to wrap it so that the covering will stay in place.Do not wrap so tightly that you cut off the circulation.
Change the bandage daily to prevent infection. If it becomes wet or dirty, change it promptly.
Use waterproof bandages or wrap plastic wrap over your bandages when you shower to keep them dry.

, If it shows signs of infection, go to the emergency room. Signs to watch for include:Increasing pain over time
Warmth
Swelling
Redness
Pus leaking from the wound
Fever

Call for medical help right away.,
Assess the current conditions.,
Locate the injured or buried victim.,
Dig the victim out to prevent suffocation.",How to Treat an Avalanche Victim1," Any time you are traveling or adventuring in an avalanche area, you should have some way to communicate with the outside world with you. Whether using a cell phone or a radio, signal for emergency services as soon as possible after the avalanche., It is important to survey the scene first to see if you are in danger of getting hurt yourself. If you don’t pay attention to the surroundings, you could get into a situation where you could be severely injured. This is also important for the safety of the victim, because it could be more difficult for them to receive needed treatment if you get hurt as well., When adventuring in areas that have a danger of avalanches, always pack basic safety equipment. Each person should have a rescue beacon that is battery powered and can send out a GPS coordinate. Bring a small snow shovel for digging, and a set of long, collapsible poles known as probes.Use your equipment to locate a buried or injured person by following the GPS signal or cries for help, and probing the snow with your poles to locate them.


Make sure the batteries are fresh in your rescue beacon. Also be sure you know how to use it properly.

, A person buried with their head under the snow can asphyxiate. Deal with the immediate risk of suffocation by starting to dig to the person as soon as possible.Once their head is uncovered, the risk of suffocation is no longer your greatest concern. Do NOT try to pull the victim out – they may have serious injuries that can be worsened by moving them. It’s best to leave them as is until help arrives, unless they are unconscious.If they are unconscious, try to dig around them as quickly as possible so you can gently lie them flat.
People uncovered within the first 10-18 minutes have around an 80% chance of survival, unless death is caused by traumatic injuries. After 35 minutes of burial, likelihood of survival decreases significantly.

Concussions might not bleed on the surface, but under the scalp, creating a ""goose egg"" or a hematoma (a large bruise).Visible external injuries are not always a good way to tell if someone has a concussion since some very minor scalp wounds bleed profusely, while some less visible impact injuries can cause major brain impairment.
Physical symptoms to look for include signs of basilar skull fracture, Battle’s sign (a swollen bruised area that appears several days after a skull fracture because blood has leaked into the area behind the ear), raccoon eyes, and rhinorrhea (leakage of cerebrospinal fluid).;
, Mild and severe concussions can result in many physical symptoms. Look for any of the following symptoms:


Loss of consciousness.
Severe headache.
Light sensitivity.
Double or blurred vision.
Seeing ""stars"", spots or other visual anomalies.
Loss of coordination and balance.
Vertigo.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in legs and arms.
Nausea and vomiting.Amnesia.
Obvious confusion.

, Since a concussion is an ailment of the brain, concussions often disrupt brain function. These disruptions include:


Unusual irritability or excitability.
Disinterest or difficulties with concentration, logic, and memory.
Mood swings or outbursts of inappropriate emotions and tearfulness.
Drowsiness or lethargy.

, When checking for a concussion, it is important to know whether or not the victim is conscious and know his or her level of cognitive function. To check the consciousness of the victim, try the AVPU code:A - Is the victim alert? - Does the victim watch you with their eyes? Does he answer your questions? Does he respond to normal environmental stimuli?
V - Does the victim respond to voice? - Does the victim respond when spoken to, even if the response is small and not completely alert? Does he need to be yelled at to respond? A victim can respond to verbal commands and not be alert. A response of ""Huh?"" when you speak to them means they are verbally responsive, yet not alert.
P - Does the victim respond to pain or touch? - Pinch skin to see if there is movement or if the victim opens his eyes. Another technique is to pinch or poke the nail bed. Be careful when doing this; you do not want to cause unnecessary harm to the victim. You are simply trying to get a physical response from him.U - Is the victim unresponsive to anything attempted?

, Most concussion symptoms appear within minutes of the injury. Others appear hours later. Some symptoms can change days later. Keep a watch on the victim and call a doctor if symptoms worsen or change., To reduce swelling with a minor injury, apply an ice pack to the affected area. Apply ice every two to four hours, for 20-30 minute increments.Do not apply ice directly to the skin. Wrap it in a cloth or plastic. If ice is not available, use a bag of frozen vegetables.
Do not apply pressure to any head trauma wound as this could push bone splinters into the brain.

, To treat head pain at home, take acetaminophen (Tylenol). Do not take ibuprofen or aspirin because that could make bruising or bleeding worse., If the victim is conscious, ask questions continually. This serves two purposes: to assess the degree of the victim's impairment, and to keep the victim awake. Continuing to ask questions can alert you to changes in the victim's cognitive state if the victim fails to answer a question they could answer before. If the cognitive state changes and worsens, seek medical attention. Good questions include:


What is today's date?
Where are you?
What happened to you?
What is your name?
Are you feeling alright?
Can you repeat the following words after me...?

, For the first twenty-four hours, stay with the victim. Do not leave them alone. Monitor their physical and cognitive function for any changes. If the victim wishes to sleep, wake the victim every quarter hour for the first 2 hours, then every half hour for the following 2 hours, then hourly.Every time you wake them, do the AVPU consciousness test as outlined above. You want to continuously monitor their cognitive and physical state in case symptoms appear later or worsen.
If the victim does not respond to being woken up, treat as an unconscious patient.

, For days after your concussion, avoid sports and strenuous activity. During this time, avoid stressful situations. Your brain needs to rest and heal.Before taking part in sports, you may want to contact your doctor.


Returning to activity too early predisposes you to increased risk for a repeat concussion and long term problems of dementia.

, Do not operate a vehicle or ride a bicycle until you feel fully healed. Get someone to drive you to and from the doctor's office or hospital.

, Do not read, watch TV, text, listen to music, play video games, or perform any other mental task. You should rest both physically and mentally., Food can positively and negatively affect the healing of your brain. Avoid alcohol after a concussion. Also avoid fried foods, sugars, caffeine, artificial colors and flavors. Instead, eat the following foods:


Avocados.
Blueberries.
Coconut oil.
Nuts and seeds.
Salmon.
Butter, cheese, and eggs.
Honey.
Any of your favorite fruits and vegetables., Any suspected head injury or concussion needs to be evaluated by a medical professional. What may seem like a minor head injury could be a fatal one. If the victim is not regaining consciousness, call for an ambulance. Otherwise, drive the victim to the nearest emergency room or doctor's office.If the patient is unconscious or if you are unsure the extent of the damage, call an ambulance. Driving a head trauma patient requires moving them, which should never done until the head is stabilized. Moving a head trauma patient could lead to death.
It may be best to be evaluated in the emergency room if you have a loss of consciousness or severe amnesia. A doctor will order a test called a CT scan to evaluate for swelling or bleeding and diagnose the concussion. Another name for a concussion is mild traumatic brain injury.

, For severe concussions, you may want to take the victim to the emergency room. If the victim shows any of these symptoms, take them immediately to the ER:


Loss of consciousness, even if briefly.
Periods of amnesia.
Feeling dazed or confused.
Severe headache.
Repeated vomiting.
Seizure., If you think a neck or spine injury may accompany the concussion, avoid moving the victim while waiting on the paramedics. Moving the person may cause further injury.


If you must move the person, do so very carefully. Make sure to move the head and the back as little as possible., If your symptoms do not improve within 7-10 days, contact your physician. If at any time your symptoms change or worsen, contact your physician., There is very little known about the effects of concussion on the brain and on cognitive function. However, some treatments prescribed by your doctor may improve lingering symptoms.


A doctor may perform any number of scans, including an MRI, CT, or EEG.A doctor may also perform a neurological test that evaluates your vision, hearing, reflexes, and coordination. Another test they may perform is a cognitive test, which checks memory, concentration, and recall."

Go to the emergency room if you have a serious wound.,
Get medical treatment for your wound.,
Let your doctor treat an infected wound.,
Get a tetanus vaccine.,
Go to a wound care center if you have a non-healing wound.",How to Treat a Wound2," Do not try to drive yourself if you have just suffered a severe wound. Have someone drive you or call emergency medical responders. You need professional medical care if you have a wound that is bleeding severely or may leave you permanently disabled if it does not heal properly. This includes:Cut arteries. If you are bleeding bright red blood which is pumped out of your wound each time your heart beats, call emergency medical responders. It is important that you receive care before you lose too much blood.
Bleeding that does not stop after a few minutes of pressure. This may occur if you have a severe, deep cut. If can also occur if you have a blood disorder or are on medication that prevents your blood from clotting.
Wounds where you cannot move or feel a body part. This may be indicative of a deeper injury to the bone or tendons.
Wounds with a foreign object stuck inside. Common examples include glass, shrapnel, or stones. In this case a doctor will need to remove the objects and prevent infection.
Long jagged cuts that are difficult to heal. If the cut is larger than about two inches, you may need stitches to help it close.
Wounds to the face. Facial wounds require expert care to prevent scarring.
Wounds that have a high risk of infection. This includes wounds that are contaminated with feces, bodily fluids (including saliva from animal or human bites), or soil.

, The care that your doctor recommends will likely vary based on whether it is infected. If it is not infected the wound will be cleaned and closed. Closing the wound quickly will help prevent scarring. There are several techniques the doctor may use to close the wound:Stitches. Wounds longer than about 2 ½ inches may be sewn closed with sterile thread. The stitches may be taken out by a doctor five to seven days later for small incisions, seven to 14 for larger wounds. Or, if your doctor feels it is appropriate, she may use thread where the stitches will dissolve after a few weeks as the wound heals.Never remove your stitches yourself. You may cause an injury or infection to the site of the wound.
Tissue adhesive glue. This substance would be applied to the edges of the wound while it is held together. As it dries it will seal the wound shut. The glue will come off by itself after about a week.
Butterfly stitches. These are not actually stitches. Instead they are sticky strips that hold the wound closed. The doctor will remove them after the wound heals. Do not remove them yourself.

, If your wound is infected the doctor will treat the infection before closing the wound. If it is closed while it is still infected, this will seal the infection in and may cause it to spread. Your doctor may:Swab the infection so the pathogen can be studied and identified. This can help determine the best course of treatment.
Clean the wound and pack it with a dressing that will prevent it from closing.
Give you antibiotics to eliminate the infection.
Ask you to return after several days so the doctor can evaluate whether the infection has been successfully treated. If so, the doctor will then close the wound.

, Your doctor may want you to get a tetanus vaccine if the wound is deep or has dirt in it and you have not had one in the past five years.Tetanus is a bacterial infection. It is also called “lockjaw” because it can cause the muscles of the jaw and neck to contract. It can also cause breathing problems and can be fatal.
There is no cure, so the best prevention is staying up to date on your vaccines.

, Non-healing wounds are wounds that have not started to heal after two weeks or have not finished healing after six weeks. Common types of wounds that are difficult to heal include pressure sores, surgical wounds, radiation sores, and wounds resulting from diabetes, lack of blood flow, or swollen legs, which often occur in the foot. At a wound care center you will have access to:Nurses, doctors, and physical therapists who will teach you to clean your wound properly and do exercises to maintain the blood flow.
Specialized therapies to remove dead tissue. This may include cutting it away, using a whirlpool or syringe to wash it away, applying chemicals to dissolve the dead tissue, and using wet-to-dry dressings that dry on the wound and absorb dead tissue.
Specialized procedures to promote healing include: compression stockings to improve blood flow, ultrasound to stimulate healing, artificial skins to protect wounds as they heal, removing fluid from the wound with negative pressure therapy, providing you with growth factors to promote healing, and using hyperbaric oxygen therapy to increase the blood supply to your tissues.

Asses the victim’s state.,
Provide good chest compressions, if the victim is unconscious.,
Check the victim’s airway.,
Start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.,
Continue administering CPR for at least 30 minutes.,
Suspect a spinal cord injury.",How to Treat an Avalanche Victim2," Before starting CPR, you’ll need to check and see if the victim in conscious. Do this by shouting “Are you okay?” while tapping the victim on the shoulder. If the victim is unconscious or clearly has a severe injury, call 9-1-1 immediately.

If the unconsciousness is due to asphyxiation from being buried in the snow, begin CPR for 1 minute, and then call for help afterward.

, Start CPR on the unconscious victim by doing chest compressions. Perform quality compressions by following these guidelines:Place your hands in the middle of the person’s chest, one hand on top of the other, with the heel of your hand against their chest over the sternum (the flat bone between the ribs in the middle of the chest).
Lean forward over the person so your arms are straight. Use your bodyweight to help you do compressions.
Compress the victim’s chest with the heels of your hands to a depth of 2 inches (about 5 cm). Compress the chest 100 times per minute. This depth and rate can be tiring – you should feel resistance.

, Use your fingers to remove any debris that has gotten into their mouth. Tilt the victim’s head back slightly to lift the chin and better open the airway.Put your cheek next to the victims mouth so that you can listen and feel for any signs of normal breathing.Normal CPR suggests doing this for 5-10 seconds, but if the patient is hypothermic (which is likely), their breathing will be very slow, so check for about 30-45 seconds.Occasional gasping sounds don’t count as normal breathing.

, If the victim is not breathing for themselves, alternate 2 rescue breaths with every 30 chest compressions.

Tilt the victim’s head back slightly and lift their chin to open the airway. Pinch their nose closed with one hand. Put your mouth over the victim’s mouth to make a seal and blow into their mouth. Blow into the victim’s mouth. Watch to be sure their chest rises when you give a breath. If not, tilt the head, lift the chin, and breathe again. Be careful not to provide too many breaths or to breathe with too much force.If you have a second uninjured person present, use the Jaw Thrust maneuver to open the victim’s airway rather than tilting their head back – this can be safer for spinal injury victims. Kneel at the top of the victim’s head, and place your hands one on each side of their face with your fingers hooked under the angle of their jaw. Lift upward (toward you) with both hands.The other uninjured party will provide chest compressions and rescue breaths.
Do not do compression-only CPR – in an avalanche situation, oxygenation is very important., If the patient has no pulse and/or is not breathing, start CPR right away. Spend a lot longer than traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation would suggest because the victim is likely suffering from hypothermia. The old adage, “A patient isn’t dead until he’s warm and dead” applies here, to an extent. If a victim was buried for longer than 35 minutes, their chance of survival is low even with CPR. If they were dug out early enough, however, providing CPR for as long as possible, at least 30 minutes, can save a life.


CPR can be tiring, especially in severe climates. If you have a companion, switch off doing high-quality CPR every 2 minutes.

, Move the victim only if it is absolutely necessary; otherwise, keep them where they are and dig around them. Avalanches can carry trees, boulders and other large objects that can hit a body and possibly cause severe trauma, including a spinal cord injury. Until you are certain that these types of injuries are not present, you should not move an accident victim.


Treat anyone with a head, neck, or back injury as if they have a spinal injury.If possible, stabilize the patient using a neck brace and back-board.
If you have to move the victim to ensure their safety and you have no stabilizing equipment, pull them by their clothing or by both arms or legs, and pull them in a straight line. This can keep spinal movement to a minimum. Do NOT twist their body or pull them by only one side of their body – this can move the spine out of alignment and worsen spinal injuries.

"
"
Keep the victim moving if they are up and conscious.,
Insulate and warm a semiconscious victim.,
Keep a close eye on ABC’s if the victim is unconscious.,
Give shocks if the victim has no vital signs.,
Prevent post-rescue collapse by handling the victim gently.",How to Treat an Avalanche Victim3," Someone with stage 1 hypothermia will be conscious and shivering. If the victim is uninjured enough to be standing, have them move around to keep as warm as possible. Insulate their body with more clothes or thermal wraps (you should pack these when adventuring in cold climates), and shield them from the wind. Give them warm fluids to drink, if you have any.The goal is not to actively re-warm them at this time, but to prevent any further drop in core body temperature., In stage 2 hypothermia, the victim will be partly conscious (i.e. half awake, unconscious but able to be aroused, or in and out of consciousness) and will probably not be shivering. Insulate their body as much as possible and apply any heat packs or warming mechanisms you have to them, especially around their core.Administer oxygen, if you have it, and get them to a hospital with an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as soon as possible., For stage 3 hypothermia, in which the patient is unconscious, do everything as in stage 2 hypothermia. Additionally, continually monitor their airway, breathing, and circulation. At this temperature, a victim can develop an irregular heartbeat or their heart can stop beating at any time.If possible, provide warmed, humidified oxygen., In stage 4 hypothermia, the victim is unconscious and has no vital signs – they aren’t breathing and/or they don’t have a pulse. Most likely, you will not have a defibrillating device with you, in which case provide CPR for as long as you can, giving good rescue breaths. If you do have a defibrillating device, check the person’s ECG. If they are in ventricular fibrillation (V Fib), give them up to 3 shocks to try to restore a regular heartbeat.If you are a medical professional and you are able to establish an IV line, infuse fluids warmed to 42°-44°C (108°-111°F). The standard is 0.9% NaCl or 5% glucose.

, Post-rescue collapse can occur if you successfully rescue a patient with hypothermia but then they suffer a life-threatening issue once they start to re-warm. Do what you can to prevent post-rescue collapse by handling the victim in the following ways during your rescue attempt:Handle the victim as gently as possible and keep jostling them to a minimum. Avoid unnecessary movement of their trunk and large joints like hips, knees, and shoulders.When the heart gets very cold, rough handling can induce a deadly arrhythmia.
Keep hypothermic patients horizontal. Standing them upright can cause a serious drop in blood pressure.
Remove the victim’s wet clothes and wrap them in a water-resistant and windproof outer shell that has heating pads, when possible.
Administer oxygen if you have it available, or as soon as possible.

"
Provide basic first aid.,
Splint an injured limb.,
Evacuate a minimally-injured victim immediately.",How to Treat an Avalanche Victim4," If the victim is not buried, and has vital signs (i.e. is breathing and has a heart beat), then proceed to give basic first aid. Remember to treat the person as if they have a spinal injury, to be safe.For severe bleeding, apply pressure to the wounded area. Apply a tourniquet proximal to the injury, i.e. closer to the body, by tightly tying a belt or strip of cloth above the area.
Only splint a broken extremity if you have to move the victim for their, or your, safety. Otherwise, keep the person still and calm until help arrives. Speak in a soothing voice and calmly tell them to keep still and that everything is okay.
Provide basic first aid by cleaning and covering wounds, if possible.

, In the event of a broken arm or leg or injured joint, try to apply a splint to minimize pain and further injury and make safe travel easier. Follow these basic guidelines for splinting an injured limb:Locate a strong, straight object to use as a splint. It can be a log, branch, rolled up towel, or anything else at your disposal. If using something from nature that may splinter, wrap it in extra clothing.
Gently wrap the injured limb in padding, such as extra clothes.
Apply the splint so it overlaps the joints above and below the injury. For instance, if the lower leg is injured, the splint should overlap both the knee and the ankle. Place the splint on the uninjured side of the limb (i.e. not over the injury), if possible.
Secure the splint with ties or tape above and below the joints. Do not tie something directly over the injury, and try not to tape directly on the victim’s skin.
Move the injured limb as little as possible.
If the person expresses pain, numbness, or tingling in the extremity after splinting, remove the splint and try again. Impeding blood flow with a splint can cause long-term damage to the limb.

, If the victim is unharmed enough to walk, assist them in leaving the area. Keep them as warm as possible by insulating them and using heating packs, removing wet clothes and replacing them, and giving them warm fluids to drink. Take them to the nearest hospital.


If help is on the way, stay where you are. They will be able to reach you quickly and will do a comprehensive exam on the victim to ensure they have no serious injuries you cannot see. Only evacuate if you are unable to contact emergency services.
If you need to move to a safer location, help the injured person walk by supporting their weight on the side of their injury.
If the person must be dragged to safety, pull them by both ankles with equal tension to keep their spine straight. Use your body weight to pull them to avoid hurting yourself.If they have leg injuries, lift their arms over their heads and pull them from below their elbows.

Wear protective clothing and gear.,
Practice safety.,
Make sure your tetanus immunizations are up-to-date.",How to Treat Road Rash," If your accident happens in a dangerous area, such as in the middle of a road, you should move yourself to a safer area (off the road) if you are able to. That way, you will reduce the danger of further injury.;
, Ensure that you (or the injured person) can move freely, and that there are no broken bones. If either is the case, then stop immediately and call or direct someone nearby to call your local emergency number.If a head injury has occurred, check for a concussion, and seek medical care immediately.

, If you cannot see the wound well yourself, ask someone for help. Call the emergency number in your area if the woundIs deep enough to see fat, muscle, or bone.
Is spurting blood. If it is, put pressure on the wound with your hands, or clothing or other material while you wait for help. This will help to slow the bleeding.
Has edges that are jagged and far apart.

, Some damage may be hidden below the skin, where you cannot see signs of it. If you were knocked unconscious, feel confused, have limited range of motion, or extreme pain, consider seeing a doctor immediately for medical assistance.

, If you want extra protection, you can also put on disposable gloves before starting to clean the wound.

, If there is any bleeding on your wound, stop it by applying pressure on the site.


Hold a clean cloth or gauze over the bleeding portion of the wound, and apply pressure for a few minutes.
Change the cloth or gauze if it becomes soaked with blood.
If the bleeding does not stop after 10 minutes, contact a doctor, as stitches or other treatment may be required., Let cool water run over your wound, or pour it over it. Get someone else to help if you cannot see or reach the wound site. Do this long enough to make sure that the water has flowed over the entire area, and washed away any loose dirt and/or debris., Use antibacterial soap and water to clean around the wound, but try not to get soap in the wound itself, as this can cause irritation.This will help to wash away dirt and bacteria and keep away infection.


Hydrogen peroxide and iodine were traditionally used to disinfect skin wounds.However, hydrogen peroxide and iodine can actually damage living cells, so medical professionals now advise that you should not apply them to a wound., If anything is stuck in the wound, like dirt, sand, splinters, etc., use tweezers to carefully remove this material. First clean and sterilize the tweezers by rubbing them with a cotton ball or gauze soaked in isopropyl alcohol.Rinse with cool water once the debris is removed.


If dirt or other material is lodged so deep in the wound that you cannot get it out, contact a doctor., Once you have rinsed and washed the wound, gently use a clean cloth or towel to dry the area. Patting rather than rubbing it dry will help you avoid unnecessary pain.

, This can deter infection and help the wound as it heals.There are numerous types of antibiotic creams and ointments, containing different active ingredients or combinations (bacitracin, neomycin, and polymyxin, for example).Always carefully follow the directions provided with your cream regarding the amount to use and method of application.
Some triple-antibiotics, such as Neosporin, contain neomycin, which can cause contact skin allergies. If you notice redness, itching, swelling, etc. after using one of these products, stop using it and switch to one containing polymyxin or bacitracin, but no neomycin.
If you cannot use a topical antibiotic cream for any reason, then apply petroleum jelly or Aquaphor to the wound area. This will keep the site moist as it heals.

, Make sure to cover your wound with a bandage to protect it from dirt, infection, and irritation from clothing during the time it needs to heal. A non-stick bandage such as a Telfa pad is preferable, or sterile gauze may be held in place with tape or an elastic band., Keep the wound elevated at or above the level of your heart as much as possible will help to reduce swelling and pain. This is most beneficial in the first twenty-four to forty-eight hours after your accident, and is especially important if your wound is severe or infected., Change the bandage covering your wound daily, or more frequently if it becomes wet or dirty.Wash any dirt away from the area using water and an antibacterial soap, as before.

, While this alone doesn’t make the wound heal faster, it may help reduce your chance of infection. It will also keep the wound from drying out, which can cause scabbing and possible scarring., Continuing to keep the wound elevated at or above the level of your heart as much as possible will help to reduce swelling and pain. This is especially important if your wound is severe or infected., Take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you have pain from wound, unless your doctor directs otherwise.Ibuprofen is also an anti-inflammatory and may help reduce any swelling.
If the skin around the wound is dry or itchy, use a moisturizing lotion to relieve this discomfort.
Wear clothing that will not irritate the wound area. If possible, wear clothing that will not rub against the road rash site while it heals. For example, if the wound is on your arm, try to wear short sleeves; if it is on your leg, try to wear shorts. This will make you more comfortable.

, Make sure to drink plenty of fluids (approximately six to eight eight-ounce glasses of fluid, especially water, per day), and to eat healthy foods while you are healing. Staying hydrated and nourished will aid the process., You will need to rest the wound area as it heals. For example, if the wound is on your leg, you will need to avoid vigorous activities like running and climbing. Avoiding overexertion of the wound area will help it heal.

, If you take care of the wound, then generally road rash should heal within two weeks.Exactly how fast your wound will heal depends on a number of factors like your age, nutrition, whether or not you smoke, your stress level, if you have an illness, etc. Moreover, antibiotic creams will only reduce your risk of infection, not actually heal the wound faster. If you wound seems to be healing abnormally slowly, check with a medical professional, as it could be a sign of something more serious, like an illness., You will need expert attention: If there is dirt or other foreign material in the wound that you can’t get out of it.
If the wound site becomes more red, swollen, warm, or painful, as these can be signs of infection.
If red streaks radiate from the wound.
If the wound site drains pus, especially if it smells foul.
If you have flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, etc.).

, Wearing proper protective clothing like long sleeves and pants when you are able to will help guard your skin against road rash. If you are participating in activities prone to injury, wear appropriate guards. Using protective gear will greatly increase the chances of you just brushing yourself off and bouncing back.For example, consider elbow, wrist, and knee pads when engaging in sports such as skateboarding and skating.
Wearing a helmet will protect your head from injury in these and other activities, such as biking and motorcycling.

, Know how to properly use any equipment related to your activities, such as motorcycles, bicycles, etc. In addition, avoid trying dangerous stunts and other reckless acts. Being careful on the road is an easy way to reduce the risk of road rash.

, Most road rash wounds have been exposed to dirt, and perhaps metal and other debris. This can mean there is a risk of tetanus infection (lockjaw). Most adults should get a tetanus booster shot if it has been more than five years since their last shot and they get a dirty wound. See your doctor about getting one as soon as possible if you have road rash."

The damage is only on the most superficial or outer layer of the skin.They will likely appear red, slightly swollen, and may or may not be slightly painful. Treat your first degree burn at home, since there is usually no need for expert medical attention. The outermost layer of skin has the ability to heal itself with care and time.First degree burns are classified as ‘minor burns’ and should be treated as such. Sometimes you may get an extensive first degree burn, such as a full body sunburn, but this does not need medical attention.;
, Your skin might also appear blotchy, blisters will form, and the pain will be much more intense. Second degree burns come from brief contact with incredibly hot things (boiling water, for example), extended contact with hot items, and prolonged exposure time in the sun. Unless your second degree burn is on your hands, feet, groin, or face, treat it like a minor burn. If you have blisters, don't drain them. If the blister is drained, keep it clean by rinsing with water and swabbing with antibacterial ointment. You can also cover the ointment on the skin with a bandaid or another dressing. This dressing needs to be changed daily.


A second degree burn burns through two layers of your skin. If your second degree burn is wider than three inches, covers you hands, feet, joints, or genitals, or doesn't heal over several weeks, then you should call your doctor for medical help. , Third degree burns are the most serious and need immediate medical attention. These happen when extended exposure to a hot object burns through all three layers of your skin, sometimes causing muscle, fat, and bone damage. The burns will look leathery and have a white or black appearance. The pain can vary depending on the level of damage to the nerves in the skin layer (pain receptors). These burns can look “wet” because of the rupture of the cells and protein leakage.


Third degree burns are always classified as a major burn and need treatment from a doctor as soon as possible., These are ‘burns’ that occur when your skin is exposed to low temperatures, like snow or ice, for an extended period of time. The area will look bright red, white, or black and will have a strong burning sensation as the skin is rewarmed. A low temperature “burn” is still considered a burn because it damages the skin's tissue layers.


Treat low-temperature burns as major burns in most cases, and get medical help for treatment.Rewarm the skin in 37°C/98.6°F to 39°C/102.2°F water immediately after exposure., Chemical burns are another type of burn caused by skin contact with harmful chemicals that damage the skin layers. These types of burns will probably appear in the form of red patches, a rash, blisters, and open sores on your skin. Your first step is always to determine what caused the burn and to call poison control immediately.


Contact a poison control center immediately if you believe you've suffered a chemical burn. Care must be taken to neutralize and isolate the spread of the chemical.Irrigate chemical burns with lots of water, however, avoid water if exposed to dry lime or elemental metals (such as sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, lithium etc.) as these can react with water and cause more injury.

, As soon as you can, run cool water over the burn. This will prevent further damage to your skin. Stick the burned area under cool running water for 10-15 minutes or until the pain subsides. Avoid using cold water, since this can damage the skin around the burn.The sudden shock of extreme heat to extreme cold will only slow the healing process., As soon as you can, or while rinsing the burn, remove anything that might constrict your skin as the wound swells. When in doubt, take it off. This lets blood to flow to the wound and starts healing it. Removing tight clothing or jewelry can also prevent further damage., If cold water isn’t an option, use a cold compress or ice pack wrapped in a towel. Place it over your burn. Apply the compress for 10-15 minutes, wait for 30 minutes, and then reapply for 10-15 minutes.Never apply ice or your compress directly to the burn, since this will damage the skin. Keep the towel between you and the ice instead.

, An over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, or naproxen can be helpful if the symptoms are bothering you. If the pain does not lessen after several hours, take another dose of the medication. Avoid giving aspirin to young children or if you are recently recovering from the flu or chickenpox.Follow the specific package instructions. They'll be different depending on what medication you choose.

, After washing your hands, use soap and water to clean the burn and prevent infection. Apply an antibiotic like Neosporin when you are done to keep the burn clean.Aloe vera can also soothe your skin. Look for aloe vera with few additives. Antibiotics or aloe vera can also keep the bandages from sticking.Do not pop blisters while you clean since they actually protect your skin from infection. Take care not to pop the blister or drain the contents, since the body is able to take care of minor blisters on its own. Antibiotic ointment isn't needed if your blisters haven't popped. But, if they have or if your wound is exposed, use an antibiotic to prevent infection., You may not need to apply a bandage to first degree burns, blisters that haven't popped, or skin that isn't exposed.But small second degree burns will need a wrap to keep out infection. Cover the burn lightly with gauze and secure it softly with medical tape. Change the gauze daily.Do not apply gauze directly to any wound. A wound must always be covered with a cream or ointment before applying gauze. Otherwise, when the gauze is removed, all the newly formed skin will be torn off with it.
Remove gauze in the direction of surrounding hair growth. If the gauze is sticking to the wound, use lukewarm water or a saline solution applied to the stuck gauze for easier removal. Make a saline solution by adding 1 teaspoon of salt to a gallon of water., The internet is awash with ""miracle"" solutions for burns, but few scientific studies have actually proven them to work.Many reputable sources, such as the Red Cross, found them to be worse for burns because they contain bacteria that can lead to infection.Natural moisturizers such as aloe vera or soy may be helpful in cases of sunburn.

, Keep an eye on the wound for changes in color to red, brown, or black. Also, watch for any green discoloration of fat layers under and around the wound. Seek medical attention if a burn does not heal over several weeks. A burn that refuses to heal can be a sign of complications, infection, or a more serious burn.Let your doctor know if you experience any of the following signs:


warmth
tenderness
hardening of the wound area
fevers greater than 39°C/102.2 F or less than 36.5°C/97.7 F (these are signs of serious infection and you should get immediate medical attention), Itching is a common complaint among patients during the initial healing period after minor burns. Topicals such as aloe vera or petroleum based jelly can soothe the discomfort caused by itching. Oral antihistamines can also be taken to help with the itchiness.

, Don't try to treat major burns at home. They need immediate treatment by a professional. Immediately call for an ambulance or visit your doctor or an emergency room immediately.Never try to treat a serious burn yourself. The following measures are simply proactive steps to take until medical help arrives.

, If possible, do whatever you can to prevent further burns or injury. Stop the heat source or move the suffering person.


Never pull on or move someone using the burned area for leverage. If you do, you could further damage the skin and possibly open up a wound even more. This can cause great pain to a suffering victim and lead to shock.

, Apply a cool, moist towel over the burned area to protect it until help arrives. Do not use ice or immerse the affected area in cold water. This can cause hypothermia or further damage to the sensitive area.

, If your burn was caused by chemicals, clean the area of any remaining chemicals. Run the area under cool water or add a cool compress as you wait for emergency help. Do not attempt any home remedies on a chemical burn.

, Only do this if you can elevate the wound without causing further damage., Look for shock symptoms: weak or rapid pulse, low blood pressure, clammy skin, disorientation or unconsciousness, nausea, combativeness. If you notice symptoms of shock from third degree burns, get medical attention immediately. Call an ambulance to get the victim to the hospital quickly. This is a life threatening situation on top of an already dangerous situation.


Severe third degree burns can cause shock because the body loses a significant amount of fluids when a large surface area is burned. The body cannot function normally with such low levels of fluid and blood.

, The victim may immediately be transferred from the hospital to a burn center for treatment. Then, remove any clothes or jewelry that are still on the victim if they might constrict the body, which might swell.


The burn may cause so much swelling that certain parts of the body become dangerously compressed (compartment syndrome). If this happens, surgery might be needed to relieve the pressure. This would also help blood flow and nerve function., For all major burns, the doctors may give 100% oxygen by intubation, a tube inserted in the windpipe.Vital signs are also immediately monitored. This way, the current state of the patient is assessed and a specific plan for care is made.

, Stop the loss of fluids and replenish the body of lost fluids with an I.V. solution. Determine the type and amount of fluid based on the individual's burn., Give pain and analgesic medication so the victim can better cope with the pain. Antibiotics are also crucial.


Antibiotics are needed because the body's main line of defense against infection (the skin) has been compromised. Medication is needed to keep bacteria from entering and infecting the wound., Recommend a calorie-rich, high-protein diet. This helps to replenish the body with vital energy and protein needed to repair all the damaged cells from the burn."

Call emergency services or a poison control hotline immediately.,
Clear the person's airway.,
Check the person's breathing and pulse.,
Keep the person comfortable.",How to Treat Poisoning1," Swallowing a poison can lead to serious complications that can't be addressed without medical intervention. If you suspect someone has swallowed a poison, get help right away. Try to determine what caused the poisoning and have the person's age and weight ready to give to the person who answers the phone.


Look for pills, plants or berries (berries), mouth burns, etc. Knowing the source of the poison is essential for treatment purposes.
If the person is unconscious or otherwise exhibiting severe symptoms, skip the call to poison control and seek medical help right away. If you're not sure what the person swallowed, seek immediate medical help, no matter what the symptoms are.
If the person has just swallowed the poisonous substance, and you're not sure whether or not it will become a serious issue, call poison control at 800-222-1222 (in the United States).Poison control is a hotline staffed with attendants who can tell you what measures to take to help the person who has been poisoned, and whether you'll need to go to the hospital.;
, If the person swallowed a household product, pills, or another substance, it's important to make sure none remains in the mouth or air passage. Wrap a clean towel around your hand. Open the person's mouth and remove traces of the substance using the towel.If the person vomits, continue monitoring the airway and keeping the mouth area clean.
If you're not sure what the person swallowed, keep the soiled towel to bring with you to the hospital for testing.

, Determine whether the person is breathing, check his or her airway, and determine if he or she has a pulse. If you don't feel breath or a pulse, administer CPR immediately.


If the person is a child, administer do child CPR.
For babies, administer infant or toddler CPR.

, Poison in the system can lead to seizures, so it's important to take measures to prevent injuries from occurring. Have the person lie down on his or her side on a comfortable surface, and place a pillow under his or her head to cushion it. Loosen belts and other tight clothing. Remove jewelry and other constrictive items.


Make sure the person doesn't lie down on his or her back; if vomiting occurs, this could lead to choking.
Continue monitoring the person's breathing and pulse, performing CPR as necessary, until medical help arrives.

The pain may feel like a heavy weight on your chest, a squeezing or tightness around the chest, or indigestion/heartburn. Moderate to severe pain or discomfort in the chest usually occurs on the left side or in the center of the chest, with the pain persisting for several minutes; the pain may also recede and then return.
During a heart attack, you may feel pain, pressure, a squeezing sensation or a feeling of fullness in your chest.
Chest pains may spread to other parts of the body, including the neck, shoulders, back, jaw, teeth, and abdomen.;
, Chest pain may be accompanied by other symptoms that indicate you are experiencing a heart attack; however, many people, in fact, have a heart attack with little to no chest pain.If you experience the following symptoms - particularly if they accompany chest pain - seek medical attention:


Shortness of breath. Some unexplained difficulty with breathing can occur before or simultaneously with chest pain, but may also be the only sign you are having a heart attack. Panting for breath or the need to take long, deep breaths may be warning signs that you are having a heart attack.Feeling sick to your stomach. Stomach pains, nausea, and vomiting sometimes accompany a heart attack, and can be mistaken for the flu.Dizziness or lightheadedness. A feeling that the world is moving or spinning, or that you might faint (or do faint), can be warning signs of a heart attack. Anxiety. You may feel anxious, have a sudden panic attack, or experience unexplained feelings of impending doom. , The most common sign of a heart attack for both men and women is chest pain. However, women (and some men) may suffer a heart attack with only mild chest pains, or without experiencing chest pain at all. Women – as well as elderly people and people with diabetes – are also more likely to experience the following symptoms of a heart attack, with or without chest pain:


Women may experience chest pain that does not conform to what is perceived as the sudden, crushing pain of a heart attack. This pain may appear and recede, begin slowly and increase in severity over time, ease with rest and increase during physical exertion.
Pain in the jaw, neck or back are common signs of a heart attack, particularly for women.
Pain in the upper abdomen, cold sweats, nausea, and vomiting are more common in women than men. These signs can be misinterpreted as pointing to heartburn, indigestion or the flu.
Breaking out in cold, nervous sweat is a common symptom in women. Usually, this will feel more like stress or anxiety, rather than normal sweating following exercise or other physical activities.
Anxiety, unexplained panic attacks and a sense of impending doom are more common symptoms for women than men.
Sudden, unusual or unexplained fatigue, weakness and lack of energy are common signs of a heart attack in women. These symptoms can last a short period of time or persist for several days.
Shortness of breath, lightheadedness and fainting., Most heart attacks build up slowly, rather than suddenly strike the victim; many people do not realize they are experiencing a major medical emergency. If you or somebody you know experiences one or more of the common signs of a heart attack, seek medical attention immediately.


Speed is critical. Around 60% of deaths from a heart attack occur within the first hour. On the other hand, those that reach a hospital within the first hour and a half have a higher chance of survival than those who arrive later. Many people mistake the signs of a heart attack for other ailments, including heartburn, the flu, anxiety, and more. It is important that you don’t ignore or downplay symptoms that may point to a heart attack, but seek help immediately.
Symptoms can be quite different from person to person, may appear in mild or severe forms, and may appear and recede and reappear over several hours. Some people can suffer a heart attack after showing only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all., About 90% of people who suffer a heart attack survive if they arrive at the hospital alive. Many heart attack fatalities occur because victims fail to receive swift medical attention, and their failure to do so is often caused by their own hesitation to act. If you feel any of the above symptoms, don't try to wait them out. Call 9-1-1 (or your country's equivalent emergency telephone number) to get help immediately.


While it's true that the symptoms could be harmless if you are indeed suffering a heart attack your life depends on getting medical attention as quickly as possible. Don't be afraid of being embarrassed or wasting the doctors' or paramedics' time – they will understand.
Emergency medical personnel can begin treatment as soon as they arrive, so calling for emergency assistance is the fastest way to get help during a heart attack.
Don’t drive yourself to the hospital. If medical personnel can’t reach you in good time, or if there are no other emergency options, have a family member, friend or neighbor drive you to the closest emergency room. , If you're around family or out in public when you believe you may suffering from a heart attack, let people know. If your situation worsens, your life may depend on someone giving you CPR, and you're more likely to get effective help if people know what's going on.


If you're on the road, stop the car and flag down a passing motorist, or call 9-1-1 and wait if you are somewhere where paramedics can quickly reach you.
If you're on an airplane, notify a flight attendant immediately. Commercial airlines carry medication on board that may be helpful, and the flight attendant can also find out if there's a doctor on the plane and perform CPR if necessary. Pilots are also required to detour to the nearest airport if a passenger is having a heart attack.

, If you cannot get to medical attention quickly, try to remain calm and do as little as possible. Sit down, rest and wait for emergency medical services to arrive. Exertion can strain your heart and can worsen the damage caused by a heart attack., Many people can benefit from taking an aspirin at the onset of a heart attack. You should take one tablet immediately and chew it slowly while you wait for emergency personnel to arrive. If you have been prescribed nitroglycerin, take one dose at the onset of a heart attack and call emergency services.


Aspirin may worsen some conditions, however, so ask your doctor today whether this is an appropriate course of action., When you survive a heart attack, it is essential to follow your doctor's advice for recovery, both in the days immediately following the occurrence and over the long term.


There is a good chance you will be prescribed medication to reduce blood clotting. You will most likely take this medication for the rest of your life. , It is quite common for people who have survived a heart attack to experience bouts of depression. Depression can stem from embarrassment, self-doubt, feelings of inadequacy, guilt over previous lifestyle choices, and fear or uncertainty about the future.


A supervised physical recovery program, renewed social connections with family, friends and co-workers, and professional psychological help are some ways in which survivors can return to normal life after a heart attack. , If you have a heart attack you are at a higher risk of a second heart attack; nearly one-third of the heart attacks in the United States each year happen to people who have survived a previous attack.The following factors will put you at an even higher risk of a second heart attack:


Smoking. If you smoke, there is almost twice the chance that you will have a heart attack.High cholesterol. An unhealthy cholesterol level is one of the most important contributors to a heart attack and other heart complications. Cholesterol can be especially dangerous when it occurs in conjunction with high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking.Diabetes, particularly if not controlled properly, can increase the chance of a heart attack.Obesity. Being overweight can raise your cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and lead to heart complications. Additionally, obesity can lead to diabetes, another factor that puts you at risk of a second heart attack., Medical complications from an unhealthy lifestyle put you at a greater risk of a second heart attack. Inactivity, obesity, high cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure, stress, and smoking all increase the risk of a heart attack.


Reduce your consumption of saturated and trans fats. Aim to avoid foods that contain partially hydrogenated oils.
Lower your cholesterol. This can be accomplished through diet, regular exercise or a cholesterol medication as prescribed by your doctor. A good way to lower your cholesterol is to eat oily fish, which contain the omega-3 fatty acid.
Cut down on alcohol consumption. Only drink the recommended daily amount of alcohol, and avoid binge drinking.
Reduce your weight. A healthy body mass index is between 18.5 and 24.9.
Exercise. Consult with your doctor on how you can start an exercise program. A supervised cardiovascular exercise program is ideal but not necessary. With your doctor's advice you can work out a program of cardiovascular exercise (e.g., walking, swimming) based on your current level of fitness and focused on reasonable, achievable targets over time (e.g., walk around the block without getting ""short-of-breath"").
Stop smoking. Quitting smoking immediately can reduce your risk of heart attack by half. "

If the victim was shot in a crime, verify that the shooter is no longer on the scene and that both you and the victim are safe from further injury. Wear personal protective equipment, such as latex gloves, if available.;
, Dial 911 for emergency medical assistance. If you are calling from a cell phone, be certain that you can provide the operator with your location. The operator will have difficulty locating you otherwise., Do not move the victim unless you must do so to keep him safe or access care. Moving the victim could aggravate a spinal injury. Elevating the wound can limit bleeding, but should not be considered unless you are confident that there is no spinal injury.

, Time is your enemy in treating the victim. Victims who reach medical facilities during the ""Golden Hour"" have a much better likelihood of surviving. Try to keep your movements swift without making the person feel more upset or panicked.

, Take cloth, bandage, or gauze and press directly against the wound using the palm of your hand. Continue for at least ten minutes. If bleeding does not stop, check the location of the wound and consider re-positioning yourself.Add new bandages over the old; do not remove bandages when they become soaked. , If the bleeding subsides, apply cloth or gauze to the wound. Wrap it around the wound to apply pressure. Do not, however, wrap so tightly that the victim loses circulation or feeling in her extremities., Gunshot wounds frequently lead to shock, a condition caused by trauma or loss of blood. Expect that a gunshot victim will show signs of shock and treat them accordingly by making sure the victim's body temperature remains consistent — cover the person so that he does not get cold. Loosen tight clothing and drape him in a blanket or coat. Typically you would want to elevate the legs of someone experiencing shock, but refrain from doing so if they might have a spinal injury or a wound in the torso., Tell the person that she's okay and that you're helping. Reassurance is important. Ask the person to talk to you. Keep the person warm.


If possible, ask the person about any medications she is taking, any medical conditions (i.e. diabetes, hypertension), and any drug allergies she may have. This is important information and may distract her from her wound.

, Continue to reassure and keep the victim warm. Wait for the authorities. If the blood congeals around the bullet wound, do not remove blood mats on wound, as this is acting to stopper the blood and prevent any more from flowing out.

, For advanced treatment it is important to consider the status of the person. A, B, C, D, E is an easy way to remember the important factors you should consider. Assess these five critical factors to see what sort of assistance the victim requires., If the person is talking, his airway is probably clear. If the person is unconscious, check to make sure that his airway is not obstructed. If it is and there is no spine injury, perform a head tilt.Apply gentle pressure to the forehead with the palm of one hand, while placing the other under the chin and using it to tilt the head back., Is the victim taking regular breaths? Can you see her chest rising and falling? If the victim is not breathing, sweep her mouth for obstructions and start rescue breathing immediately.

, Apply pressure to any bleeding, then check the victim's pulse at the wrist or throat. Does the victim have a discernible pulse? If not, begin CPR. Control any major bleeding.

, Disability refers to damage to the spinal cord or neck. Check to see if the victim can move his hands and feet. If not, there may be an injury to the spinal cord. Look for compound or obvious fractures, dislocations, or anything that looks out of place or unnatural. If the victim shows signs of disability, you should refrain from moving him or her.

, Look for an exit wound. Check the victim as thoroughly as possible for other wounds that you may be unaware of. Pay special attention to the armpit, buttocks or other difficult-to-see areas. Avoid completely undressing the victim before emergency help arrives as this may advance shock.

, Carefully assess the situation to determine that there is no sign of disability or any wounds that would suggest the victim sustained a spinal injury. If this is the case elevate the limb above the heart to reduce blood flow. Apply direct pressure to stop bleeding as described above.

, In addition to direct pressure, it is also possible to apply indirect pressure for limb injuries to limit the blood flow to the wound. This is done by putting pressure on arteries or, as they are sometimes called, pressure points. They will feel like particularly large and hard veins. Applying pressure to them will limit internal bleeding, but you need to apply pressure to verify that the artery applies to the wound. To slow blood flow to the arm, press on the brachial artery on the inner side of the arm, opposite the elbow.
For groin or thigh injuries, apply pressure to the femoral artery, between the groin and the upper thigh. This one is particularly large. You will have to use the entire heel of your hand to reduce circulation.
For lower leg wounds, apply pressure to the popliteal artery, behind the knee.

, The decision to apply a tourniquet should not be taken lightly because it might result in loss of limb. But if the bleeding is extremely severe and you have bandage or fabric on hand you can, consider making a tourniquet.

Wrap bandage tightly around the limb, between the wound and the heart, as close to the wound as possible. Wrap around limb several times and tie a knot. Leave enough fabric to tie a second knot around a stick. Twist stick to restrict blood flow., If a bullet has penetrated the chest, it is probable that a sucking chest wound exists. Air is coming in through the wound, but not coming out, collapsing the lung. Signs of a sucking chest wound include a sucking sound emanating from the chest, coughing up blood, frothy blood coming from wound, and shortness of breath. When in doubt, treat the wound as a sucking chest wound., Look for the wound. Remove clothes from wound. If some fabric is stuck to the wound, cut around it. Determine if there is an exit wound and if so apply procedure to both sides of the victim’s wound.

, Take airtight material, plastic is best, and tape it around the wound, covering all sides except for the bottom corner. Oxygen will escape from this hole.As you seal the wound, encourage the patient to completely exhale and hold his or her breath. This will force air out of the wound before you seal it., It is possible to do this with two pads over each wound, held very tightly in place by a wrapped bandage.

, You can do this by talking to the conscious patient, or watching the chest rise and fall.


If there is evidence of respiratory failure (stopping breathing), reduce pressure on the wound to allow the chest to rise and fall.
Prepare to perform rescue breathing.

, They will either use your seal or replace it with a better one.

Call for emergency help.,
Leave the toxic area immediately.,
Check the person's breathing and pulse.,
Keep the person comfortable until paramedics come.",How to Treat Poisoning2," Poisoning by inhalation can lead to serious medical issues, and it's important to get emergency medical professionals involved. Inhalation could also affect others nearby, so don't try to handle the situation by yourself.

, Poisoning by inhalation can occur as a result of toxic fumes, smoke, or gas. Move the person, and anyone else in the vicinity, to an area safe from these substances. It's best to go outdoors, well away from the building where the inhalation occurred.


If you have to rescue the person from a building, hold your breath as you go in. Cover your mouth and nose with a wet piece of cloth to filter the air.Some toxic gases, like carbon monoxide, don't have a smell and can't be detected except by a special detector. Don't assume that just because you don't smell or see something toxic, a room or building is safe.
If it's impossible to move the person, open the doors and windows to let fresh air inside and let the fumes or gas escape.
Don't light a match or a fire, since some invisible gases are flammable.

, If you don't feel breath or a pulse, administer CPR immediately. Continue checking the person's breathing and pulse every five minutes until emergency help arrives.

, Have the person lie down on his or her side, so that he or she won't choke in case of vomiting. Cushion the person's head with a pillow, and remove constrictive clothing and jewelry.

Remove traces of the substance.,
Flush the area with lukewarm water.",How to Treat Poisoning3," This will enable you to seek specific advice on treating the victim. Stay on the phone and follow all the instructions given to you by emergency assistance or the poison control center.


If the person's skin or eyes were exposed to a corrosive substance, have the bottle ready so you can describe it to the poison control center attendant.
Some containers have information about what to do in case of skin contact; take those instructions into account as well.

, If the poison is a skin corrosive, remove the victim's clothing from the injured area. Discard the clothing, since it will no longer be wearable and could injure someone else. Be sure there's no chance that you or the person who has been poisoned will suffer more exposure to the substance.

, Run lukewarm water over the skin or eyes, whatever was exposed, for 15 to 20 minutes. If a burning sensation persists, keep flushing the area until medical help can be obtained.


If the poison has come in contact with the victim's eyes, ask the person to blink a lot but to avoid rubbing his or her eyes, since this could cause further damage.
Don't use hot or cold water to flush the area.

If you notice someone collapse or faint, go over to the person right away., If someone has just had sudden cardiac arrest, then that person will not have a pulse. Check the person’s radial or carotid pulse to see if you can detect anything.


The radial pulse is located on your wrist just under the base of the thumb/palm. Feel around the person’s wrist, using your index (first finger) and middle finger on one hand until you find the pulse. If you can't feel a beating pattern than there is no pulse.
The carotid pulse is located on the neck. The carotid arteries are just underneath the jaw on both sides of the neck. Press the same two fingers on one side of the neck in the soft hollow area just beside the person’s Adam’s apple., A person who has experienced a sudden cardiac arrest will also not be breathing. ""Look, listen, and feel"" if the person is breathing or not.Watch for lung movement to determine if the person is getting any oxygen. Keep in mind that time is critical and every minute that the person is without oxygen increases his risk of permanent brain damage.Place your hands, palms down, on the person’s chest. Then, check to see if you can feel or see a rise and fall of the chest indicating breathing. An alternative method is to listen for breathing by placing your ear close to the person’s mouth.

, A person who has had sudden cardiac arrest will not be alert either. This means that if you say something to the person, she will not respond or make any sign that she has heard you.Medical practitioners and first-responce assistants suggest using the C.O.W.S system: Can you hear me? Open your eyes! What's your name? Squease my hand (gently place your hand on their palm)!

, This should be your first priority. Someone who has suffered sudden cardiac arrest will need immediate medical attention and will need to be taken to a hospital for the best chances of survival. Make sure that you call for help right away or have someone else do so. Do not just shout for anyone to call 911. If there are other people around, select one person, look him in the eye, and tell him to contact emergency services. Say something like, ""You, the man in the red shirt! Call 911 now!""

, If you are somewhere that might have a public AED (cardiac defibrillator), ask someone to try to locate it and bring it to you. If one is available right away, then use it. An AED can analyze the heart rhythm, deliver life-saving shocks, and provide instructions as well as images to help you revive the person.

, Quickly check the unconscious person’s pulse and breathing again to see if she has resumed breathing or if you can detect a pulse. If not, then you will need to start CPR.


Cardiopulmonary resuscitation allows manual compression of the heart to pump blood and manual assisted breathing to get oxygen to the person. Those who have no pulse and/or are not able to breath on their own require immediate CPR.

, Make sure the person is lying face up. You will need to be able to press on the person’s chest and deliver breaths, so turn the person over if he is not lying face up.


If you suspect head and/or neck injury, do not move the person. This may result in paralysis or other serious complications. Provide as much aid as you can without moving the person., Before you start delivering CPR, take a moment to make sure that you are in the right position. Place the heel of one of your hands on the center of the chest over the lower part of the bony center (breastbone). Place the heel of the other hand over top on the first hand. Straighten your arms and make sure your shoulders are directly over your hands.

, Once you are in position, you can begin compressions. Push down hard and fast. Your compressions should press down a minimum of two inches on the chest and allow for full chest recoil as well.


Your pace should be such that you are delivering about 100 compressions per minute. An easy way to keep this pace is to deliver compressions to the beat of the song ""Stayin' Alive."", You should count your compressions so that you know when to deliver the two breaths. Before delivering the two breaths, tilt the person’s head by back slightly by placing the palm of one hand on the forehead and using your other hand to lift the chin. Once the head is tilted, pinch the person’s nose, cover the person's mouth with yours, and blow until you see the chest rise. Give the person two breaths. Each breath should take one second to deliver.After completing 30 compressions, deliver the two breaths and then deliver 30 more compressions.Keep repeating the cycle until help or an AED arrives.
If you are not certified in CPR, you can skip the breaths. The emphasis for a bystander is on delivering chest compressions.CPR is exhausting and can be intense (you may break the person's ribs while delivering compressions). It's okay to trade off with someone else if you become exhausted — it doesn't help if you are too tired to deliver CRP properly.
If you suspect head or neck trauma it is best not to perform the tilt technique, instead a jaw thrust should be performed so as not to aggravate the neck. Place the palms of your hand over the person’s cheek bone and place fingers under the angle of the jaw and lift the jaw upward., The heart pumps blood or beats due to an internal electrical system. This allows the heart to beat at a constant rhythm. When this system malfunctions or stops, the heart stops beating or beats irregularly losing its rhythm. An AED is a portable device that checks the heart rhythm and can send an electric shock to the heart to try to restore a normal rhythm if necessary.If an AED is available, then use it immediately! If it is not available, then continue CPR until it is or until help arrives.
It is safe to use an AED on a pregnant woman. Defibrillation does not transfer any significant electrical current to a fetus.The AED machine only delivers a shock once it has analyzed the heart rhythm and determines if it is needed. If so, it will prompt everyone to stand clear of the person receiving the shock and not to touch them. However, you should still screen to make sure no one is in contact with the person before pressing the “shock” button by yelling ""Clear!""

, A defibrillator works best when used by someone with proper training. In situations where lots of people are around, ask if anyone knows how to use a defibrillator. If no one is available, do not panic. The machine gives directions and voice prompts once it has been turned on, so that anyone can use it., Water conducts electricity, so it is a bad idea to use an AED in wet conditions. You may end up shocking yourself and others as well as the victim. If you notice that the person is lying in or near a puddle, then move the person to a dry area before using the AED.

, Although having some training in how to use an AED is ideal, the device will give you step-by-step instructions on how to use it. You'll hear voice prompts and/or see prompts on a screen. Follow the instructions carefully.


A 911 operator may also be able to help guide you as you use the device. If you are not sure how to work the AED and no one else is around, call 911 and ask for guidance., If the person's chest is wet, dry it off. AEDs have sticky pads with sensors called electrodes. Apply the pads to the person's chest as pictured/described in the instructions or as described by the voice instructions.


Place one pad on the right center of the person's chest above the nipple.
Place the other pad slightly below the other nipple and to the left of the rib cage.

, The “analyze” button will check to see if the person has a pulse. Before you press the button, make sure no one is touching the person. Stay clear and instruct others to do the same while the machine checks the person's heart rhythm., If a shock is needed, the AED will let you know when to deliver it. Before you push the AED's ""shock"" button, stand clear of the person and make sure that others are clear as well., After a shock has been delivered by the AED, resume CPR for two minutes. Give 30 compressions followed by two breaths. After two minutes of CPR check the neck artery for a pulse. If no pulse is present, press the “analyze” button to analyze the heart rhythm again and if a shock is advised deliver shock by pressing the “shock” button.


Repeat this process until help arrives or pulse returns."

Dress the cut.",How to Stop Bleeding1," Running water will not only clean the wound, but help to stop the bleeding. Run cold water over the cut to constrict the blood vessels and stop the bleeding. Doing the same with hot water will cauterize the cut, allowing the blood to clot. Don’t use both hot and cold water - just one or the other should do the trick.


You can use an ice cube instead of cold water to close off the arteries. Hold the ice to the cut for a few seconds until the wound closes up and stops bleeding.
If you have multiple small cuts on your body, taking a hot shower will clean off all the blood and cauterize the multiple gashes concurrently.;
, As a result of the waxy texture of vaseline, applying a small smear of it to minor cuts will block off the blood flow outside of the skin and give the wound time to clot. You can use regular chapstick if you don’t have any plain vaseline on hand.

, The astringent properties of vinegar help to disinfect and clot small cuts. Dab a bit of white vinegar onto the cut with a cotton ball, and wait for the bleeding to stop.

, Similar to white vinegar, witch hazel acts as a natural astringent great for clotting small cuts. Pour a little over your cut or dab it on with a cotton ball for the same effect.

, Sprinkle a bit of cornstarch onto the cut, being careful not to rub it or cause any further abrasions. You can lightly press the powder onto the cut to help expedite the process. When the cut has stopped bleeding, use running water to rinse the cornstarch off.

, Follow Mary Poppins’s advice at pour a little sugar over the cut. The antiseptic qualities of the sugar will help to clean it, while simultaneously aiding the blood clotting process.

, This is a great option if you are cut while hiking or outdoors. Grab some (spider-free!) spiderwebs and place them over the cut, rolling them up if necessary. The webs will stanch the blood flow and give your cut time to clot internally., These waxy pencils were originally made for shaving nicks and razor burn but work great for any small cut. Rub the pencil over your skin and let the mineral astringents it contains go to work. It will sting a bit on contact, but after a few seconds both the pain and bleeding will go away.

, Similar to a styptic pencil, your deodorant has aluminum chloride which works as an astringent to stop the blood flow. Put some on your finger before smearing it over the cut, or rub the stick directly onto your nick.

, Originally created as an aftershave, use regular Listerine to help stop blood flow. Pour some directly over the cut or dip a cotton ball into the Listerine and dab it on. You should notice a decrease in blood flow after a minute or two.

, Cayenne pepper will help to seal up your wound fast and stop bleeding. However, this is one of the more painful methods. If you’re in a hurry to stop your bleeding and don’t mind a little stinging, sprinkle some cayenne pepper over your cut and let it work its magic. When the bleeding stops, rinse it off with a bit of cold water., This is a soap-like bar created from minerals which help to stop bleeding. Wet the alum block in water and gently rub it over the cut. There is no need to apply pressure as you place the block over your gash; the minerals will do the work themselves., You know when you crack an egg, the filmy membrane left on the inside of the shell? Well this actually works to seal off cuts and give your body time to clot. Peel the membrane from an egg (try to keep it in as large a piece as possible) and place it over your cut. Within a few seconds you should notice a stoppage in the blood flow.

, Apply a sterile bandage or dressing to the wound to help keep out any dirt and stop further bleeding. You can use a simple band-aid or a piece of clean gauze.

Do not use your finger or hand until your follow-up appointment.,
Start moving your finger once it is out of the splint.,
See a physiotherapist if your injury is severe.",How to Treat a Broken Finger," Bruising and swelling will likely occur because you have broken tiny blood vessels in your finger. If you have fractured the fingertip, there will likely be purple blood visible underneath your nail and bruising on the pad of your finger.You may also feel a sharp pain when you touch the finger. This is a symptom of a broken finger. Some people can still move their finger though it might be broken and may experience numbness or a dull pain. But these could still be signs of a fractured or broken finger and require immediate medical attention Check for sensation loss or loss of capillary refill. Capillary refill is the return of blood to the finger after pressure has been applied.;
, You may see large open wounds or pieces of bone that have broken your skin and are sticking out of your skin. These are signs of a severe fracture, known as a compound fracture. If you have these symptoms, you should seek immediate medical attention.As well, if there a lot of blood coming from an open wound on your finger, you should see a doctor., If part of your finger is pointing in a different direction, the bone is probably broken or dislocated. A dislocated finger occurs when the bone has moved out of position and usually looks deformed at a joint, such as your knuckle.You should see a doctor if you have a dislocated finger.


There are three bones in each of your fingers and they are all arranged in the same manner. The first bone is the proximal phalanx, the second bone is the middle phalanx, and the bone farthest from your hand is the distal phalanx. Because your thumb is the shortest finger, it does not have a middle phalanx. Your knuckles are joints formed by the bones of your fingers. Often, you break your finger at the knuckles, or the joints.Breaks at the base of your finger (the distal phalanx) are usually easier to treat than fractures at your joints or knuckles., If your finger is not deformed or bruised, and the pain and swelling eventually subside, you may have just sprained your finger. A sprain means you have stretched the ligaments, which are the bands of tissue that hold the bones in your finger together at the joint.If you think you have a sprained finger, avoid using the finger. Check to see if the pain and swelling gets better over the next day or two. If the pain and swelling does not go away, you should get medical treatment to confirm the finger is only sprained and not fractured or broken. A physical and x-rays will determine this.

, Wrap the ice in a towel and apply it to the finger on your way to the emergency room. This will reduce swelling and bruising. Never apply ice directly to your skin.Keep your finger elevated as you ice it, above your heart. This will allow gravity to help reduce the swelling and bleeding.

, A splint will keep your finger elevated and hold it in place. To make a splint:


Take a long thin item, as long as your broken finger, such as a popsicle stick or a pen.
Place it next to your broken finger, or have a friend or family member help you hold it in place.
Use medical tape to wrap together the stick or pen and your finger. Wrap it loosely. The tape should not squeeze or pinch your finger. If your finger is wrapped too tightly, this can cause additional swelling and cut off circulation to your injured digit., If possible, try to slide off any rings on your finger before the finger swells. It will be much harder to remove the rings once your finger swells up and starts to feel painful., Your doctor will ask for your medical history and perform a physical on you to get more information about you and to see how the injury occurred. Your doctor will check for deformity, neovascular integrity, malrotation of the finger, and skin lacerations or injury.

, This will allow the doctor to confirm whether there is a fracture of the bone in your finger. There are two types of fractures: simple and complex. The type of fracture you have will determine your treatment.Simple fractures are breaks or cracks in the bone that do not break through the skin.Complex fractures are breaks in which the bone sticks though the skin., A simple fracture is when the finger is stable and there are no open wounds or cuts on the skin of the broken finger. The symptoms will likely not get worse or cause complications with your ability to move your finger once it is healed.In some cases, your doctor may strap your broken finger to the finger next to it, known as buddy taping. The splint will hold your finger in position as it heals.Your doctor may also move the bone back into place, a procedure known as reduction. You will be given a local anaesthetic to numb the area. Your doctor will then realign the bone.

, You can take over-the-counter pain medication to reduce swelling and pain, but you should still check with your doctor about which medicines are right for you and how much you can take each day.Your doctor can also give you a prescription for pain medication to decrease the pain, depending on the severity of your injury.
If you have an open wound on the finger, you may need antibiotics or a tetanus shot. This medicine will prevent any infection caused by bacteria entering the wound.

, If the fracture is severe, you may need surgery to stabilize the broken bone.


Your doctor may recommend open reduction surgery. The surgeon will make a small cut on your finger so she can see the fracture and move the bone. In some cases, the surgeon may use small wires or plates and screws to keep the bone in place and allow it to heal properly.These pins will later be removed once your finger has healed.

, If you have a compound fracture, bad break, nerve injury, or vascular compromise, your doctor may refer you to an orthopedic surgeon (bone and joint specialist) or a hand surgeon.These specialists will then examine your injury and determine if your injury requires surgery.

, This will prevent any infection, especially if you have open wounds or cuts on your finger. Keeping your finger elevated will also help to keep your finger in position and let it heal properly., Use your non-injured hand for daily things like eating, bathing, and picking up objects. It’s important you give your finger time to heal without any movement or disturbance of the splint.Your follow-up appointment with a doctor or hand specialist should be one week after your initial treatment. At the follow-up appointment, the physician will check that the bone fragments are still aligned and healing properly.For most fractures, your finger will take up to six weeks of rest before you can return to sporting activity or work.

, As soon as your doctor confirms your finger has healed and it is out of the splint, it’s important to move it around. If you keep it splinted for too long, or immobile after it is out of the splint, the joint will stiffen and your finger will become harder to move and use., The physiotherapist can give you advice on how to regain normal movement in your finger. She may also give you gentle hand exercises you can do to keep your finger moving and to ensure it regains its mobility."

Lie down.,
Elevate a wounded limb.,
Remove any debris.,
Apply firm pressure directly to the wound until the bleeding stops.,
Apply pressure steadily.,
Look for seepage from the wound.,
Use pressure points if necessary.,
Continue applying pressure until the bleeding stops or help arrives.,
Monitor the breathing.",How to Stop Bleeding2," It will help to lessen the likelihood of shock if you can elevate the legs or position the head lower than the trunk. Check the victim's breathing and circulation before proceeding. See How to Treat Shock for information about how to recognize and manage symptoms of shock.

, Raising the wounded limb (assuming it is an extremity that is injured) above heart will help to reduce severe bleeding. If you suspect a broken bone, however, do not attempt to move the limb.

, Clean up any visible foreign body and dirt, but do not clean the wound thoroughly as this can aggravate the wound.Your immediate priority is to stop severe bleeding. Cleaning the wound can wait.


If the foreign object is large however (large piece of glass, knife, or similar) do not remove it. It is most likely stopping a lot of the bleeding itself. Just put pressure and bandage around the object taking care not to push it in further.


, Use a pad of clean gauze, dressing, or clothing. (Even your hand can work if nothing else is available.) Place your hand over the pad and apply firm pressure with fingers or a hand to the wound.

, If the injury is on a limb, you can use tape or a cloth wrapped around the wound to maintain pressure (a folded triangular bandage placed over the wound and tied is ideal). For groin or other parts of the body where you cannot wrap the wound, use a heavy pad and keep using your hands to press on the wound.

, Add more gauze or additional bandages if the original soaks through. Do not over-wrap it, however, as increased bulk risks reducing pressure on the wound. If you suspect the bandage is not working, remove the bandage and pad and reassess the application.If the bleeding appears controlled, maintain pressure until you are sure the bleeding has stopped or medical help has arrived.

, If you cannot stop bleeding by pressure alone, combine using direct pressure to the wound with pressure to one of these pressure points. Use your fingers to press the blood vessel against the bone. The most commonly needed are described below::


The brachial artery - For wounds on the lower arm. Runs on the inside of the arm between the elbow and armpit.
The femoral artery. For thigh wounds. Runs along the groin near the bikini line.The popliteal artery - For wounds on the lower leg. This is found behind the knee.


,


Use a tourniquet if the bleeding is life threatening. Tourniquets usually stop bleeding instantly if applied correctly, but incorrect tourniquet use can harm the patient.

, Check that the bandages are not too tight - if the victim has cold, pale skin, toes or fingers that do not restore to normal color after compression, or the victim complains of numbness or tingling, it is probable that the bandaging is too tight."
"
Call an ambulance immediately.,
Relax in a comfortable position.,
Check for breathing.,
Maintain normal body temperature.",How to Stop Bleeding3," Get the bleeding victim to hospital as quickly as possible. Internal bleeding cannot be treated at home and can only be dealt with by a doctor.

, Keep the victim calm, resting comfortably, and prevent further injury. Don't stress movement, and remain laying down if you're able.

, Monitor the victim's airway, breathing and circulation. If there is any, attend to external bleeding.

, Keep from getting too hot or too cold by applying rags dipped in water and placed over the forehead.

Think about what style of cane you would like.,
Measure yourself to determine the length of cane you will need.,
So obviously a white cane is going to be white, right?,
Consider whether you want a folding or a straight cane.,
Think about what kind of material you want your cane made from.,
The final detail you need to think about is what kind of tip you want.",How to Choose a White Cane if You Are Partially Sighted or Blind," The three main kinds are the ID or symbol cane, the guide cane and the long cane. None of these canes are suitable for leaning on, so if you are visually impaired and want a weight-bearing cane, your best option is to go for a white support cane. It will not aid your mobility in the way the guide canes do but it will act as an ID cane.


The ID cane doesn't aid your mobility. It is simply a white cane that is there to let other people know that you have a visual impairment. If your visual impairment is not too severe or you simply prefer not to use a longer cane, it is an easy way of telling people about your visual impairment and allows them to be more helpful towards you.
The guide cane not only tells others that your vision is impaired but it can also be held diagonally in front of you and gives you some protection on the street from being bumped or jostled or from walking into objects immediately in front of you. Additionally it can be held downwards and used to detect steps and curbs. If you still have a reasonable degree of vision or simply aren't comfortable with using a long cane, a guide cane can be an excellent choice.
The long cane is the best known style of white cane. It is used by sweeping it across the floor in front of you and so can provide you a great deal of information on the terrain ahead as well as warning of obstacles in front of you. This cane combines the advantages of the other two canes with the maximum aid to mobility.;
, For ID canes the length isn't important but you will need the right length for your height when using the other canes.


A guide cane is traditionally the length from the floor to your waist. However if you have particularly short arms you might benefit from a longer cane - and a shorter cane if your arms are long.
A long cane traditionally extends from floor to sternum or underarm, although sometimes people use even longer length canes.

, Wrong! You can have your white cane in different colours if you wish. And if you also have a hearing disability then you can have two red stripes on the bottom of your white cane to let others know about your hearing impairment.

, Straight canes tend to be lighter but obviously folding ones can be much more convenient when sitting in a crowded space as they can be put away until you need them again.

, They come in various forms of aluminum, other metals and plastic.

, There are many different kinds of tip and not all of them may be suitable for the kind of cane you've chosen. If using a particular tip is important to you then make sure it's compatible with the cane you're considering before making a final decision. Some cane tip options are:


The pointer tip. This is like a finger on the end of the cane. It's tapped over the ground so may give less information about the terrain. This tip is traditionally used with a guide cane.
The ball tip. This is a ball the size of a small apple which is rolled over the ground in front of the user. It provides much more information about the terrain and has become a very popular choice for long cane users.

Whichever option you choose, make sure to consult your doctor at some point in this process before making a final purchase. He can suggest which oximeter will work best for you and decide if you require any special features.


While consulting with your doctor, decide what your goals are for using a pulse oximeter. There are several varieties of oximeter, so your intended use for it will help you pick one. If you only want to check your oxygen levels periodically, a small clip-on oximeter will probably work fine. If you have a chronic illness that requires continuous monitoring, you'll need a model capable of constant use. If the doctor also wants to measure your heart rate, he may want you to get an oximeter with a heart rate monitor. By talking with your doctor, you can narrow down your specific needs and make finding the right oximeter much easier.;
, All pulse oximeters perform the same basic function: measuring the level of oxygen saturation in the blood. There are various types, however, all of which have specific advantages and drawbacks.Portable or finger oximeter. This version is most commonly used at home. It is small, rectangular shaped and clipped on the finger. The display screen is on the probe itself. This type is usually battery operated. It is commonly used to spot check oxygen saturation by clinicians, caregivers, or patients themselves.

Handheld oximeter. This is mostly used by medical institutes and hospitals since it is slightly more sophisticated and gives more accurate readings. The probe is attached to a cable connected to the screen. In order to get a reading, the probe must be attached to the person’s finger — ideally the index finger. This type of oximeter is utilized for spot checks, but is also capable of continues oxygen saturation monitoring. It is usually utilized by hospitals, ambulatory health settings, home, or EMS.

Tabletops with sensors. This model is usually bigger than a handheld pulse oximeter. It is capable of spot checks and continuous monitoring. Its size makes it ideal for hospitals, medical facilities, home care and subacute settings.

Wrist-worn sensors. This model is wireless, and usually used for continuous monitoring. Your doctor may want to monitor your oxygen levels on a daily basis or while you sleep, making this model ideal. This instrument is designed like a wristwatch. A small wire connects the probe, placed on the index finger, to a small monitor on the wrist. The readings will appear on this wrist monitor.

Fetal pulse oximeters. If you need to asses the oxygen saturation for children, you need to look for a brand that specifically indicated for children. Children’s pulse oximeters are designed to fit snugly on small fingers. There are also varieties that can attach to the foot or head that may work better if your child's fingers are very small., Besides different types, oximeters can include a variety of different features. Keep all of this in mind while gathering information to decide which are necessary for you.Levels of accuracy. Some devices feature warning light, which would indicate whether there is interference or inaccurate reading. This will help you determine if your oxygen levels are low or if your device is malfunctioning.
Alarms. Certain pulse oximeters would give out audible sound to alert users of low oxygen saturation. This is helpful for those who do not have a medical background and are not familiar with the normal range of oxygen saturation and heart rate.
Readability of displayed measurements. Screen color and size can make a difference in reading the displayed data. Pick a display that you can read with no trouble.
Durability and battery life. You intended use will help determine how durable of a machine you'll want. If it's just for personal use, you don't need an especially rugged machine. If you need only intermittent oxygen readings, your device doesn't need a long battery life.For continuous oxygen saturation reading, you'll need either a very long battery life or a plug-in-device. This would prevent you from having to replace batteries often., Most probes come in the 0.3 inch to 1 inch size range, which can accommodate most adult fingers. You'll only need to seek another option if your fingers are either very large or very small. The probe should fit snugly around your finger. If your finger bulges out or protrudes in any way, the probe is too small. Consult a store employee for a larger size.If ordering online, measure your finger from the top of the nail to the bottom of the pad on the tip of your finger. Use this measurement to search for your specific finger measurement., After purchasing the oximeter, you should test it with your doctor. If it proves to be inaccurate, you'll want to be able to return it and get a more accurate one.

, When you decide on an oximeter, you'll need to check it for accuracy. Tests indicate that various defects can make oximeters vary widely in accuracy. To check yours, take it to your doctor's office. Compare the readings from his pulse oximeter to yours. If they are the same, your oximeter is in good working order. If not, return it and get another one., Since a pulse oximeter works by shining light through the skin, dirt can interfere by blocking light and lead to inaccurate readings. You can also get an infection if bacteria contaminates the clip. To avoid this, make sure your hands are clean before placing the clip on your finger.Follow these rules from the CDC to ensure that you've properly washed your hands.
Make sure your hands are completely dry before using the oximeter.

, Nail polish absorbs the light the oximeter emits, which will make it difficult for the reader to detect hemoglobin. As a result, you will get an inaccurate reading. Be sure the finger you clip the oximeter to is free of nail polish.If this is an emergency and there is no time to remove the polish, you can place the clip on sideways to avoid as much of the polish as possible., Since the oximeter works by emitting light to detect hemoglobin, bright lights may interfere and lead to an inaccurate reading. Do not use the oximeter in sunlight and turn any bright lights away from the oximeter while it's in use., The most common cause of inaccurate readings is movement. To prevent this, stay perfectly still while the oximeter is taking its reading.You may use the oximeter while exercising to monitor your oxygen saturation under exertion, but stay still while the reading is being taken., If your hands are cold, there is probably not enough blood in them. Since the oximeter needs blood for a proper test, cold hands can lead to an inaccurate reading. Rub your hands together to warm them up and stimulate blood flow. This will help give you a correct reading., Make sure the probe is snug around the finger. If your oximeter has a monitor attached, make sure this sits above the fingernail.
If your oximeter has a plug, be sure the cable runs through the back of your hand.

, This helps minimize motion, as well as ensures that a good supply of blood will get to your finger. Holding your arm up in the air will drain blood away from the test site and lead to an inaccurate reading., After being placed on your finger, the oximeter should display your readings within about five to 10 seconds. If your model also measures pulse, this may take a little longer to calculate fully. Oximeter display styles vary, but the oxygen saturation reading is usually the top number, in percentage form. Consult the device's owner's manual if you are unsure how to read your oximeter's displayIf the oximeter fails to display a reading, try removing it and placing it back on your finger. If this doesn't work, make sure there are fresh batteries in the machine.

, Some newer oximeters store data or transmit readings to a computer. If you don't have one of these, make sure to write down all your readings and show them to your doctor., A normal oxygen saturation reading is 95% or above; 92-94% indicates that there may be a problem. Lower than 92% could be an emergency. If your hands aren't cold, you aren't wearing nail polish, you didn't move during the test, and the oximeter wasn't exposed to direct light, you should contact your doctor immediately if you read below normal., If your oximeter is battery-powered, be sure to keep it charged. That way if you need it in a hurry, it will be ready for use right away., Inevitably your oximeter will get dirty from use. Keeping the probe clean is important for two reasons. First, dirt and dust can block light emitted by the oximeter and lead to inaccurate readings. Second, buildup of microorganisms on the probe can cause an infection when you put it on.Use a lightly damp cloth or paper towel to wipe away dirt.
Use an alcohol swab to kill bacteria and viruses.

, Make sure your oximeter is somewhere it won't get knocked over and damaged.


If your oximeter is the plug-in type, make sure all plugs are out of the way and won't be tripped over., When unplugging a cable, you should always grab the plug itself, never the wire. This could damage the internal wiring and lead to a fire hazard."

Monitor your reactions.,
Make sure you are taking your drug as directed.,
Consider how long you have been taking your medication.",How to Change Anxiety Medications1," Doctors often use antidepressants to treat anxiety disorders. However, it can take antidepressants several weeks to have an effect, and many have unpleasant side effects. Therefore, before you decide to switch medications, wait at least two weeks after beginning any medication. Some medications can take up to six to eight weeks to have any real effects. Keep this in mind when deciding to switch medications.Unpleasant side effects than can result from antidepressants in the first couple weeks of taking the medication are dizziness, nausea, sweaty palms, and diarrhea. See if these side effects subside after two weeks of taking the medication. If they do not, and you find that the side effects are intolerable, think about switching medications.Friends and family members might be able to help you judge if a medication is working or not, particularly in the early days and weeks of taking the medication. Especially if you are bothered by early side effects, your friends or family members might see an improvement in your depression before you do.;
, Before switching medications, make sure you are taking the drug as directed. Sometimes medications do not work because the patient isn’t taking the drug consistently. The unpleasant side effects discussed above can cause some patients to take their medications inconsistently.Some medications are meant to be taken every day while others are meant to be taken now and then. Check the instructions on your medication to determine how frequently you should be taking them. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about how to take your medication.

, Some anxiety medications lose their effects after six months of regular use. For example, benzodiazepines lose their therapeutic effects after four to six months of use.If you have been regularly taking an anxiety medication for six months and the medication is not helping your symptoms or your symptoms are resurfacing, then it might be time to change your medication."

Check the doctor’s order sheet and the IV sheet for the patient.,
Determine what type of fluid is in the new IV bag.,
Prepare the necessary materials.,
Check the sterility of the new IV infusion.,
Bring the necessary materials to the patient’s bedside.,
Explain the procedure to the patient.,
Wash your hands thoroughly with anti-microbial soap and clean water.,
Prepare the new IV bottle.,
Disinfect the rubber port of the bottle.,
Close the roller clamp of the previous administration set by rolling it downwards.,
Kink the tubing of the administration set near the spike.,
Spike the container without contaminating the port.,
Hang the IV fluid on the designated IV pole.,
Regulate the flow rate based on the duration of the infusion.,
Update the patient’s IV sheet.,
If the IV fluid is close to the level of 100, change the IV.,
Allow the patient to go to the bathroom, sit in a chair, and move around the hospital room.,
Check the IV regularly to make sure it is delivering the fluid correctly.,
If the patient complains of any pain or redness, check the needle.",How to Change an IV," Counter check the IV label, the bottle number, the type of solution, the amount of solution, the additives(if necessary), the duration of infusion and the IV flow rate. Confirming all of these details will ensure the patient receives the right amount and type of IV solution.


Always counter check the data in the patient’s chart because the doctor’s orders vary from person to person, For example, patient 1 and 2 may have the same type of IV fluid but they will each have a different regulation per minute.;
, The type of fluid will affect how often you need to change the patient’s IV. The normal lifespan of an IV solution without an additive is 72 hours, so after 72 hours, it will need to be changed.IV bags with additives need to be changed every 24 hours. As well, most IV bags with medications have a lifespan of 24 hours. IV solutions with additives have a shorter life span since the effectiveness of the additive or medication needs to be accounted for.
IV bags with food substitutes like Lipid or TPN need to be changed every 24 hours, as just like solid food, these substitutes can go bad or spoil. If there are any TPNs and lipids left in the bag when you change it, they should be discarded.
Keep in mind that regardless of what type of solution is in the IV bags, IV lines need to be changed every 24 hours. This prevents the tubing from clogging due to the different additives or TPN attached to the tubing.

, These include:The prescribe IV fluid. Make the new prescribed IV fluid is available one hour before the procedure.
Alcohol swabs or cotton balls with alcohol
IV label
IV pole/IV stand
A watch with a second hand.

, The solution should be clear and there should be no matter in the solution. It should be sterile and in good condition.Also check for the expiration date of the solution. This is a vital check because there are risks associated with expired or unsterile fluids infused in patients.

, This will prevent any back and forth from another station to their bedside and save you time during the procedure.

, This will lessen their anxiety and assure the patient cooperates.


Inform the patient that you are going to replace the IV fluid and what type of fluid you are going to introduce into the patient’s system. Assure them that replacing the IV fluid does not mean you will need to reinsert the needle.
Explain to the patient that they will experience a slight cold sensation when the fluid enters their veins, and that it will go away after 1-2 minutes.

, This will decrease the spread of microorganisms.


Wet your hands and apply an anti-microbial soap. Rub your palms together.
Continue to rub your palms together, as well as the back of your hands.
Rub soap between the fingers on each hand and with your fingers together.
Rub soap on both thumbs, in circles on both palms and on both wrists.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. A good way to estimate the right washing time is to sing the Happy Birthday Song twice.
Once you’re done washing, rinse your hands, starting from the tip of the fingers to the wrist. Pat your hands dry with a clean cloth.

, First, remove the cover of the IV bottle by pulling the plastic off the top of the IV fluid., This is where you will insert the spike so it is important to this area by wiping the port with alcohol swabs or cotton with alcohol in a circular motion., This will prevent liquid from leaking into the spike and a sudden gush of fluid from the new IV solution.


The roller clamp is located in the long plastic tube, where the fluid runs from the IV.

, Do this by folding the tube near the spike. This will prevent air from entering the tube.


It is important that there is no air in the tubing because when air enters the body it will create an air embolus that can be very dangerous to the patient.

, Place the new IV fluid on a hard surface like the bedside table and firmly insert the spike until the end of the pointed part of the spike is completely inserted into the bottle.Avoid touching the spike, or letting it touch any other objects except the port, as this will prevent the spread of microorganism that can lead to infection.

, Make sure the pole is 2-3 feet taller than the patient to prevent a backflow of blood., The flow rate or the drops per minute should be accurate to achieve the prescribed amount of fluid in the patient’s body.For example, if the prescribed flow rate is 42 drops per minute, use your watch to count the drops that accumulate in one minute.
If the flow rate is too fast, move the roller of the roller clamp downwards.
If the flow rate is too slow, move the roller of the roller clamp upwards.
Then, count again until you reach the prescribe drops per minute.

, Include the type of solution, the type of medicine incorporated, the time and date the IV was changed, and the flow rate of the new IV solution.

, A level of 100 means the IV fluid is nearly empty, so be sure to change it before it runs out.


Patients may also bring this to the attention of their nurse, as they will be able to observe if there is very little fluid left in the IV.

, Just make sure the patient has access to a help button or is within shouting distance of a nursing station or a hallway with medical workers. You want to be sure you are available if the patient needs help moving the IV pole or stand.

, As well, look for any blood in the tube, near the IV puncture site. This backflow is an indication you need to adjust the IV bottle so it hangs a little higher.As well, do not allow the patient to touch or adjust the roller clamp as only a qualified medical worker or nurse should adjust the IV’s flow rate.

, Pain and redness at the IV puncture site may indicate that the needle has dislodged from the vein."
"
Make a list of your reactions.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Create a plan to change medications.,
Never abruptly stop taking any medication.,
Monitor the new medication.",How to Change Anxiety Medications2," When the medication is doing little or nothing to help with your anxiety, provide your doctor with a list of what the drug does and does not do. If it takes the edge off of your jumpiness, but increases your distress during a panic attack, mention that. By taking note of how the drug is affecting you, it will help the doctor determine which anti-anxiety medications to prescribe you.


Carry a journal with you so you can take accurate notes on how the drug is affecting you.

, Contact your doctor to set-up an appointment. Bring your journal with you so you can tell your doctor how the medication is affecting you. Your doctor will re-assess your symptoms and propose other medications that might work for you.

, There are no official guidelines to switching medications, and your experience with your current medication will affect the process of switching to another medication. You and your doctor will need to create a plan to switch medications that is unique to your situation. However, the general course of action that doctors take is to gradually wean you off one medication over a week, before beginning any new medication.


For example, if your current medication is improving your symptoms, but the side effects are unbearable, your doctor may gradually reduce the dosage of your current medication while gradually increasing the dosage of the new medication.
On the other hand, if your medication isn’t improving your anxiety at all, and the side effects are intolerable, your doctor may stop your current medication at a quicker rate, and start you on a new medication.Switching from one medication to another in the same drug class can occur at a quicker rate than switching from one medication to another that is of a different drug class.

, It is important to never suddenly stop taking your medication. The withdrawal symptoms can be worse than your actual symptoms, and many people mistake their withdrawal symptoms for a worsening of their anxiety. Always speak to your doctor first before taking any drastic actions, it is not worth it. You and your doctor will be able to come up with a way to safely wean you off any medication.Side effects that can occur if you suddenly stop taking a medication are increased anxiety, restlessness, shaking, insomnia, nausea, stomach pain, depression, confusion, panic attacks, pounding heart, sweating, and even seizures in severe cases., Compare the results of the second anxiety medication to the first one. This will make it easier for your physician to narrow the selection further in the event that you do not respond well to that second drug.

Have someone you can rely on.,
Supplement your medication with other therapies.,
Exercise.",How to Change Anxiety Medications3," Switching medications can cause even more anxiety, as well as side effects. Therefore, when switching medications, it is very important to have a person in your life that you can rely on in times of need. This person can be a friend, family member, or partner. By having someone there, your transition will be more tolerable.

, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often combined with medication to treat anxiety. CBT has proven to be very effective in treating anxiety disorders, even more so than anxiety medications. This is because CBT attempts to address the root of your anxiety; therefore the benefits tend to last beyond the end of treatment. Consult your doctor about getting CBT when changing medications.You can also try using other complementary strategies to control anxiety, such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga., Exercise is also considered to be a very effective treatment in treating anxiety. Therefore, when switching medications, try to add exercise to your routine to lessen any side effects or anxieties you have when switching medications.However, always consult your doctor to see if exercise and other therapies are a good idea.

Learn about the various types of depression medication, beginning with the 4 different categories of antidepressants commonly prescribed.,
Review your depression symptoms.,
Find out if a close relative has ever taken a depression medication, since this might indicate which medication will work the best for you as well.,
Consider other medications you are taking or additional medical conditions, to avoid possible drug interactions.,
Give a medication time to work before making a decision.,
Monitor for side effects while taking the depression medication.",How to Choose a Depression Medication," Ask your doctor why he is suggesting a particular medication for your condition.


Antidepressants fall into 4 basic categories; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). All of these medications work by altering the level of certain chemicals in the brain, particularly serotonin. Since they all work by slightly different mechanisms, patients will find that one type of antidepressant may be more appropriate for their specific symptoms.
Be aware that SSRIs, the most common type of antidepressant, are not usually suggested for women who are pregnant or patients over 65. MAOIs and TCAs are older antidepressants that tend to produce more side effects and are not typically used as a first course of action in treating depression.;
, Find a medication that specifically addresses them.


Different medications for depression work in different ways, addressing a variety of depression symptoms. For example, a patient who deals with chronic fatigue as a result of depression may need a medication that offers mild stimulation. Patients who have difficulty sleeping may need a formula that provides sedation. Individuals who experience anxiety in addition to depression may require a medication that address anxiety symptoms, like a racing heartbeat and dizziness, as well.

,


If a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, has successfully taken a specific antidepressant medication in the past, there is a good chance that the drug will be effective for you as well. In some cases, starting with these medication choices offers the best and fastest odds for effective treatment.

,


The best depression medication will depend on whether you have been diagnosed with other medical conditions and are currently taking medication for them. For example, women who are taking Tamoxifen for breast cancer may experience drug interactions if they take some types of antidepressant medication while on the Tamoxifen. Women who are pregnant also need to choose a depression medication that is safe during pregnancy.

,


Most depression and anxiety medication takes time before symptoms of the condition begin to improve. Many drugs take between 4 and 6 weeks before they offer full therapeutic benefit. It is important to give antidepressant medication sufficient time to work before you determine if it is the right formula for your condition.

,


Medication for depression can cause side effects, although specific symptoms vary from one medication--and one person--to another. Some of the most common side effects associated with these drugs include insomnia, nausea, decreased sex drive, weight gain, dry mouth and dizziness. Patients that experience any side effects from the medication may want to try a different drug to determine whether the new medication is easier to tolerate.

Determine your price range.,
Choose a model.,
Decide whether you will test blood pressure on the wrist or upper arm.,
Measure the wrist or arm once you've chosen a testing site.,
Assess memory storage based on how many times per day you need to test blood pressure.,
Evaluate additional monitor features.,
Read warranty options.,
Learn how to use the blood pressure cuff from a professional.",How to Buy a Blood Pressure Cuff,"


Blood pressure monitors can range in price from $20 to over $100. The brand of the cuff and the features it includes factor heavily into this price. Decide before shopping how much you can afford to spend. This will help you focus on monitors that meet your budget.;
, Blood pressure monitors come in manual, semi-automatic and automatic models. Each kind of model requires the user to perform different functions.


Manual blood pressure cuffs must be wrapped around your arm and pumped up using a rubber bulb at the end of the cuff. You must read the blood pressure from the manual dial and store it yourself. These are the least expensive monitors and cuffs but they require the most input from the user.
Semi-automatic monitors also need to be wrapped around your arm but have automatic reading functions. The user presses a button and the monitor automatically inflates, records the blood pressure and displays it on a digital display on the monitor's screen. These monitors provide some memory storage for storing your readings in the machine instead of having to record them yourself. Semi-automatic cuffs fall in the middle of the price range.
Automatic monitors have molded cuffs that the user slides up the arm without wrapping it. Pressing one button inflates the cuff to the necessary caliber, reads your blood pressure and displays and stores it. These monitors tend to be the most expensive but also offer the most additional features and storage capacity.

,


Wrist blood pressure cuffs are smaller than upper arm cuffs and only come in automatic models. The cuff is placed on the wrist where a blood pressure reading is taken automatically. Some doctors feel that wrist monitors are less accurate than upper arm monitors because they are further away from the flow of blood from the heart and may, therefore, not completely read the user's true blood pressure.
Upper arm cuffs are larger but they offer more choices in model style and price range. Upper arm cuffs could require the user to wrap the cuff correctly before the blood pressure reading can be taken, but most health professionals feel that these are the most accurate model of cuff.

, Wrist monitors typically fit wrists up to 10 inches (25.4 cm) in circumference and most upper arm monitors have cuffs that can fit an arm up to 18 inches (45.7 cm) in circumference. If your arm (or your patient's arm) is larger, choose a monitor that specifies it has a large cuff, which usually fits an arm up to 24 inches (61.0 cm) around.

,


Semi-automatic and automatic blood pressure cuffs are equipped with memory storage that can store up to 200 blood pressure readings. Monitors tend to increase in price with larger memory storage. Home users testing once or twice a week to make sure blood pressure stays normal will be well-equipped with a monitor that stores 20 readings. If you're tracking your pressure daily to report it to your doctor, a monitor that stores 100 readings will be better suited to your needs.
Some monitors can store readings for multiple users. Consider a multiple user monitor if you and another family member will both be testing your blood pressure regularly.

,


Semi-automatic and automatic blood pressure monitors now come equipped with additional features that can measure pulse rate, detect irregular heartbeat and track changes per second in your systolic or diastolic rates. These features will raise the price of the monitor, so consider carefully whether you really need them. Users tracking blood pressure to monitor a heart condition could benefit from these features, but they might be unnecessary for others.

,


Most blood pressure monitors and cuffs will have a warranty available for purchase that will guarantee the function of the monitor from 1 to 5 years. Some warranties cover the whole monitor, while others only cover the digital display or the actual monitor, but not the cuff. Some brands will charge an additional fee for warranty activation while other brands offer the warranty free with the purchase of the monitor.

,


It's best to purchase your blood pressure monitor and cuff from a facility with a health care equipment specialist on staff that can help you understand how to properly operate your monitor and store your readings. If this isn't available, schedule an appointment with your doctor or a nurse. Learn what steps to take before taking a reading to ensure that it's accurate.

Choose your product.,
Measure out the correct dose.,
Apply the cream/gel to your body.,
Wash your hands before and after applying it.,
Cover the application area with clothes.,
Don't shower for at least two hours or more.,
See your doctor at regular intervals.,
Keep it away from women and children.,
Recognize negative side effects.",How to Apply Testosterone Cream," Once it's been established by your doctor (via blood tests) that your body is producing less testosterone than it should, talk with your doctor about what product (and strength) is most appropriate for your situation. Androgel and Fortesta are both available in individual packets and multi-dose pumps.Vogelxo is available as individual packets, multi-dose pumps and tubes.


If you are using a pump for the first time, prime it before measuring out your first dose by holding it over the sink and pushing the pump all the way down at least three times for the Androgel and Vogelxo pumps or eight for the Fortesta pump.
The individual packets (Androgel, Fortesta and Vogelxo) are more convenient to use because they are pre-portioned and easy to access — you just have to tear the packet open.;
, Once you've primed the gel pump, place the palm of your hand under the pump and push down the recommended number of times as prescribed by your doctor.The strength of the gel and the number of pumps needed are based on what your base testosterone levels are and how large a person you are. If you're using a tube of Vogelxo gel, then simply measure out the recommended amount into your hand — typically about the size of a 50 cent piece.


AndroGel is available in two dosage strengths: 1% and 1.62% concentrations. Both are applied to the skin, but in different amounts.
The recommended starting dose of Androgel 1% is 50 mg applied once daily to your skin.If you are using the individual foil packets, tear the packet open along the perforated margin and squeeze the entire contents either into the palm of your hand or directly onto your skin where your doctor recommended applying it.

, Apply the testosterone cream/gel to clean, dry skin somewhere on your shoulders, upper arms or abdomen (stomach) — unless your doctor recommends a different location.The stronger concentration of AndroGel (1.62%) is usually applied to the shoulders and upper arms only. In general, the cream/gel is applied to areas that can be covered by clothes easily to prevent children, women and pets from coming into contact with it.


Fortesta gel/cream is typically applied to the front or inner skin of the thighs (upper legs).
In contrast, Vogelxo gel/cream is only applied to the shoulders or upper arms, but not the abdomen or stomach.
Testosterone cream/gel is never applied to the scrotum or penis. Don't apply it to skin that has any cuts or scrapes.

, As soon as you finish applying the testosterone cream/gel to your clean, dry skin, it's important to wash your hands with warm water and soap immediately afterwards.The potential danger is transferring some of the hormone to a child, woman or pet before it completely absorbs into the skin of your hands.


Although testosterone is beneficial for men (within reasonable doses), it can disrupt the hormone balance in children, women and pets, such as dogs and cats.
Don't touch anyone or any pet immediately after applying testosterone cream/gel. Thoroughly wash and dry your hands (with a clean towel) before doing anything else.

, After you've washed and dried your hands, it's time to put on clothes in order to cover the area of application.Doing so is more for the protection of others (and pets) than anything else. Allow the testosterone cream/gel at least 10 minutes to absorb into your skin before putting on shirts, pants or shorts.


Depending on the health and hydration of your skin, it may take less than 10 minutes for most of the gel to absorb, or it might take as long as 20 minutes.
It's best to wear cotton garments that are breathable so that the testosterone gel can continue to absorb into your skin once your clothes are on.

, Just to be on the safe side, it's recommended that you don't get your skin wet for at least two hours after applying the testosterone gel. More specifically, wait for at least two hours if you apply either AndroGel 1.62%, Fortesta or Vogelxo, but closer to five hours if you apply AndroGel 1% before showering, bathing or swimming in a pool.You should also avoid lots of vigorous exercise for a few hours after applying the testosterone gel if the exertion makes you sweat a lot.
Although the gel/cream may look like it's completely absorbed into your skin after 10 minutes or so, it actually takes longer for it to penetrate all the layers of your skin and reach your bloodstream.

, It's important to schedule regular visits with your doctor (every few months or so) so they can check your progress, take blood samples and see if the testosterone medication is working as expected.It can take three to six months of daily application of testosterone gel for hormone levels to become normal — sometimes longer.


Sign and symptoms that your testosterone levels may be too low include: low sex drive, trouble getting an erection, hair loss, lack of energy, loss of muscle mass, increase in body fat and mood changes (depression).
Testosterone gel/cream should not be used treat the symptoms of low testosterone in men who have low testosterone due to normal aging., Although testosterone medication can make significant health improvements in men who have abnormally low levels, the hormone can be harmful to women and children.For females, it can create a hormone imbalance with estrogen and trigger more masculine secondary sexual characteristics to develop — deeper voice, more hair growth, etc. For young boys it can over-stimulate their development or make the sexual characteristics appear prematurely.


Testosterone therapy may cause birth defects in pregnant women who come in contact with the medicine.
In reality, rubbing up against the skin of someone who's just applied the gel is not especially dangerous, but repeated exposure to testosterone can certainly cause problems in women, fetuses and children — as well as pets.
Children and women should also avoid contact with the unwashed clothing of someone who uses testosterone gel.

, Testosterone is a steroidal hormone and applying it to your skin for long periods of time (many months or years) increases the risk of negative side effects. More common side effects include blood in the urine, difficulty urinating and frequent urination because hormone therapy can affect the prostate gland in men.Report any noticeable side effects to your doctor immediately.


Other relatively common side effects include: bloating and swelling around the body (face, hands, feet), acne on the face and back, blurred vision, feeling dizzy, flushed face, headache, aggressive behavior, sweating, hair loss and faster heartbeat. If you have sleep apnea it may worsen and you may need to speak with your doctor about treatment with a CPAP machine.
Men using testosterone cream are also at risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to the increased red blood cell count that results from testosterone therapy. You may want to talk to your doctor about screening for this and keep an eye out for leg/calf pain or shortness of breath.
Taking testosterone medication typically causes your testicles to get smaller due to atrophy (not working as hard producing natural testosterone).
On the other hand, testosterone gel therapy can enlarge the penis in men and clitoris in women.

Your prosthesis will likely need daily adjustments to achieve a proper fit. Whenever you are wearing your prosthesis, make sure it fits properly to help your limb stay comfortable and to avoid damaging your prosthesis.Your prosthetist will advise you on how to properly fit your unique prosthesis.
Most adjustments will be made by adding more layers of padding, compressing your limb or other simple adjustments. Do not make any adjustments to the prosthesis itself unless your prosthetist has shown you how to do so.

, Even though you may have properly attached your prosthesis in the morning, it is likely that the fit will change over the course of your day. Your prosthesis may shift or your limb may have slightly changed shape, resulting in an uncomfortable fit. Be ready to make small adjustments during the day to help keep you comfortable and maintain your prosthesis.Humidity can cause your limb to swell and alter the fit of your prosthesis. Place a bandage on the stump to decrease swelling when you're not wearing the prosthesis.Cold temperatures can cause your limb to shrink, requiring you to readjust your prosthesis.

, Because you never know when you'll need to make an adjustment to your prosthesis or limb, it's a good idea to carry extra supplies with you during your day.

Consult your insurance provider.,
Consider comfort.,
Make a list.,
Have supplies professionally installed.",How to Buy Home Use Medical Supplies,"


Determine whether you will need the equipment or supplies on a permanent basis or just for a short time before you get home-use medical supplies. You may need to rent equipment like walkers or wheelchairs for a short time, but supplies needed for long term use may be cheaper if purchased outright.;
,


All equipment like wheelchairs, bed lifts, scooters and ramps have specific height and weight capacities. This is the amount of weight the equipment can safely support and the corresponding height, if applicable. Take the measurements of the person that will be using the supplies with you when you buy home-use medical supplies to be sure the equipment is safe.

,, A specialist will be able to help you decide what you need and what will fit in the home.

,


Ask your health care insurance provider about coverage options for home-use medical supplies and equipment before you purchase. Your insurance may cover some or all of the cost based on medical necessity, but might also require you to use a specific brand or vendor in order for the items to be covered.

,


Items used daily in the home can be made more comfortable with extra details like added padding on crutches or wheelchair seats, baskets on walkers or a smaller-size needle in a glucose monitoring device. Consider what equipment will be most comfortable and easy to use in addition to cost when you make your home-use medical supply purchases.

,


It will be helpful to make a list of all the items needed if you're outfitting a whole room or entire home with home-use medical equipment. Work with a doctor or physical therapist to compile a list of necessary items ahead of time so you don't get overwhelmed by options and products.

Evaluating the existing EKG machine in the office: it's on its last legs, but you decided to wait until it was broken beyond repair.,
Find the product you need, by shopping around:


Allow yourself time to shop the internet for an EKG machine; do not trust your local rep just because of having dealt with him or her for years.,
Realize you will receive service when you purchase over the internet, as most EKG manufacturers have authorized service representatives in each area of the country.,
Expect your local rep to have a role in selling you supplies, although you should periodically check the prices they are offering.",How to Buy an EKG Machine,"


Paying too much: Your machine breaks and the local rep who has been providing you with gauze pads, cotton balls and all your other office supplies brings an EKG machine that he represents into the office for you to consider.
Finding that your nurses' love it, and you need the machine: the local rep gives you a price.
Your rep for some large distributors accepts incentives to promote certain machines, in this case EKG's, but the machine may not be the one for your practice.
Haggling little, if at all, and, voila, there is a brand new machine in your office.;
,
Well, rather than going to the internet to find the best price on that product -- the rep's job is to get you into a dependent relationship.
Avoid being used as in the industry lingo: ""Own the relationship and you will own the business"".

,


They will train office staff on proper use of the machine, no matter which distributor the EKG machine was purchased from.
Further, the manufacturer and often the distributor will handle all warranty and service issues.
The result? When buying an EKG machine, you get the same or comparable service from an internet company as you do from a company you find in the classified section or one of your Journals, product magazines that come to your office, or promotional direct-mail cards that have a variety of medical equipment in them.

,


If your rep's service and pricing is not up to par, there are usually 2 or 3 reps in the same area from other companies who are ready, willing and able to help you.
But when it comes to buying an EKG machine, the lesson here is that you should explore other purchasing options.Maybe you can trade in your old machine for store credit?

Know when to use strip bandages.,
Choose a size.,
Remove the packaging.,
Place the gauze over the wound.,
Firmly attach the adhesive.,
Change regularly.",How to Apply Different Types of Bandages1," Strip bandages come in a variety of sizes and types. These bandages are ideal for covering small cuts and scrapes and minor wounds. These bandages are particularly effective for use on wounds on your hands and/or fingers, as they easily cover small cuts while staying firmly attached when applied to unusual angles., Strip bandages come in single-size packs and multi-packs with many sizes. Whenever selecting a strip bandage, make sure the padded gauze part of the bandage is larger than the wound itself.

, Most strip bandages, made up of an elastic or cloth adhesive sticker over a small bit of gauze, come packaged individually. Remove the bandage from the packaging and remove the coverings on the adhesive part of the bandage before trying to apply it., Strip bandages have a small piece of gauze centered in piece of adhesive tape. Place the padded gauze section of the bandage directly over the wound. Be careful not to apply the adhesive tape part of the bandage to wound, as this can open your cut when removing the bandage.If necessary, you can apply a small amount of anti-bacterial ointment to the gauze pad before applying the bandage to the wound.
Try to avoid touching the gauze with your fingers so that you don't transfer any dirt or germs to the bandage.

, Once you have covered the wound with the gauze part of the bandage, gently stretch the adhesive tape part of the bandage and attach it firmly to the skin surrounding the wound. Make sure there is no slack or any gaps in the adhesive tape so that the bandage stays securely in one spot., You will want to remove and replace the strip bandage regularly. When changing the bandage make sure to clean and dry the wound thoroughly and allow it to be exposed to the air for a few minutes before reattaching a replacement bandage. Take care not to allow any tugging or pulling on the wound itself when removing a bandage.You should replace strip bandages anytime they get wet. Also, you will want to change the bandage as soon as the gauze pad becomes soaked with fluid draining from the wound."

Know when to use elastic/wrap bandages.,
Secure the gauze.,
Wrap the elastic bandage.,
Fasten the bandage.,
Change regularly.",How to Apply Different Types of Bandages2," When a wound is too large to cover with a strip bandage, it is best to cover the wound with gauze and an elastic/wrap bandage. These bandages are ideal for larger wounds on the extremities, like the arms or legs, because the bandage will wrap neatly around the limb., Elastic/wrap bandages are not designed to cover the wound. You will need to apply sterile gauze to wound itself before applying the bandage. Make sure the gauze covers the entire wound. It is better to use gauze pads that are slightly larger than the wound.If necessary, you can apply tape to the outside of the gauze pad itself to hold it place until you cover it with an elastic bandage.
Again, you can apply a medicated ointment to the pad to help disinfect and heal the wound.

, Once the gauze pad is in place, you need to wrap up the area with the elastic bandage. Start by wrapping the bandage below the wound. Moving upwards, apply the bandage, covering at least half of the applied bandage with each new pass. You will be done when you have applied the bandage to a spot above the wound., Now that the elastic/wrap bandage has been applied, you need to fasten it. This can be done a number of ways. You can use tape or clips to hold the end of the elastic bandage in place. Make sure the bandage is not too tight before securing the end of the bandage., In order for the wound to drain and heal, you need to remove the elastic bandage from time to time. Every time you remove the bandage, be sure to thoroughly clean and dry the wound, allowing it to sit in the open air for a few minutes. As a general rule, you will need to change the bandage at least once a day or when drainage from the wound soaks through the gauze pad."

Understand the purpose of a bandage.,
Avoid bandaging too tightly.,
Use a bandage for breaks and dislocations.,
Know when to seek medical attention.,
Clean and treat wounds prior to bandaging.",How to Apply Different Types of Bandages3," While many people think that bandages are used to stop bleeding or infection, they’re actually used to hold a dressing in place. Bandages come with a small bit of dressing attached (like a band-aid) or are put over the top of a separate piece of sterile dressing. This is important to note, because if you simply put a bandage over a wound without dressing, the wound will continue to bleed and can become infected. Never put a bandage directly over a wound.

, If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of an overly-tight bandage, then you know the discomfort it can cause. If a bandage is attached too tightly, it can cause more damage to the wound/body and cause discomfort/pain to the wearer. A bandage should be applied tight enough so that the dressing doesn’t become exposed or become loose, but loose enough that it does not restrict blood flow., Not all bandages have to be used for wounds; you can use a bandage for broken bones and dislocations as well. If you experience injuries like a fractured bone, dislocated arm, eye problems, or another internal injury, you can use a bandage to support and secure it. The only difference with bandaging internal injuries is that you don’t have to use any gauze/dressing. A special type of bandage is used for these injuries (as opposed to a band-aid or similar bandage). Typically a triangle bandage, t-shape bandage, or bandage tape is used for support.Any suspected fractures or dislocations can be supported in this manner until you see a doctor.

, Bandaging minor wounds is appropriate for home treatment, but if you ever experience a serious wound, you should bandage it as a way to protect the wound until you can seek proper medical attention. If you’re not sure whether your wound/injury constitutes a ""serious injury,"" you should call your local nurse hotline and ask for advice.If you bandage a wound and it has still not begun to heal or causes significant pain after 24 hours, you should head to a doctor for help.
If a wound is larger than 3cm, has loss of skin and/or involves underlying tissues, it is best to seek medical aid.

, If you’re not in an emergency situation or a rush, you should always take time to thoroughly clean a wound prior to bandaging it. Use water to rinse a wound clear of debris, and a soap or disinfectant to kill any bacteria. Pat the wound dry, and apply an antiseptic cream to prevent infection. The dressing and bandage should be applied over the top of this.If there is any debris around the injury, use gauze to wipe away from the injury in a star pattern before rinsing. This helps keep the water from rinsing particulates into the wound.

Use a strip bandage for small cuts.,
Use a knuckle bandage for finger and toe wounds.,
Use a butterfly bandage for slices and cuts.,
Use gauze and adhesive tape to bandage a burn.,
Use moleskin to bandage a blister.",How to Apply Different Types of Bandages4," The most common type of bandage is a strip bandage — usually known as a Band-Aid, which is actually a brand name. These are best for use on small cuts and abrasions that occur on a flat surface. To apply, simply remove the wax-paper backing and position the gauze-portion over the wound. Use the sticky wings to secure the bandage, being careful not to pull them too tight or the bandage will peel off., A knuckle bandage is a special adhesive bandage shaped like an ""H."" This makes it easy to apply to cuts and abrasions between your fingers or toes. Peel off the wax paper backing and then position the wings to go between the fingers/toes, with the center piece located over the wound. This will help the bandage to stay in place for longer. This is important because wounds between the fingers and toes are in a frequently moved area of the body., A butterfly bandage can be recognized by two sticky adhesive strips connected by a thin, non-sticky strip of bandage. This style of bandage is used for keeping a cut closed, not for absorbing blood or preventing infection. If you have a slice or cut that can be ""pulled apart,"" you may consider using a butterfly bandage. Peel off the backing, and then place the bandage so that the sticky parts are on either side of the cut. Pull the closure a bit tight to help close off the cut. The non-sticky center strip should be located directly over the wound.A piece of sterile gauze secured with tape should be placed over the butterfly closure for at least the first 24 hours to help prevent infection while the cut seals itself.

, If you experience a minor burn (symptoms including redness, swelling, slight pain, and the affected area is no larger than 3-inches wide), you can treat it at home with basic bandaging. Use a piece of sterile, ideally nonstick gauze (as even minor burns can blister or open unexpectedly), to cover the burn. Then, use adhesive bandage tape to secure the gauze in place. The adhesive bandage should not come in contact with the burn at all., Moleskin is a special type of foam-adhesive bandage used to prevent a blister from being rubbed. Moleskin is typically doughnut shaped, with a cut-out in the center for placement over the blister. Remove the backing of the moleskin round, and place it so that the blister sits inside the cut-out. This will prevent rubbing and relieve pressure. you can place a strip bandage over the top of the moleskin to prevent infection, should the blister pop.


You can make your own makeshift moleskin by taking layers of gauze slightly taller the blister is high and cutting a hole out of them just a touch larger than the blister. Center this on the site, then add a piece of nonstick gauze overtop and tape in place.

"
Use a pressure bandage.,
Use a doughnut bandage.,
Use a triangle bandage.,
Use gauze rolls.,
Use a tensor bandage.",How to Apply Different Types of Bandages5," For serious cuts and abrasions, use a pressure bandage. A pressure bandage is a long piece of thin gauze with a thick piece of padded gauze located near one end. The padded gauze is placed over the wound and the thin strip is wrapped around it to apply pressure and secure it in place. This is best used to prevent heavy bleeding from a wide cut or abrasion. You can use adhesive tape to secure the end of the gauze in place., You can use these bandages for impalements and puncture wounds. If you have a wound that contains a foreign object, like a shard of glass, a piece of wood, or a piece of metal, you need to use a doughnut bandage. A doughnut bandage is a thick, ""O"" shaped bandage that relieves pressure around an impaled object or deep puncture. Leave the impaled object in place (do not attempt to pull it out!) and place the bandage around it. Then, use adhesive gauze tape or gauze wrapped around the edges of the doughnut to hold it in place. Do not wrap any gauze or tape over the center of the doughnut where the impaled object is located.You can make your own doughnut bandage by rolling a triangle bandage/sling into a tight, snakelike coil, then making a loop the size required to support the impaled object. (Loop it around a finger, fingers or hand as a mold.) Then take the loose, coiled ends of the bandage and lace them though your loop, around the outer side and back through the loop. Tuck the tips of the bandage back into the doughnut shaped structure to secure them. In this way, you can make support structures for a wide range of injuries.

, To secure a dislocated or broken bone, a triangle bandage is ideal. This small-looking bandage unfolds into a large, triangle-shaped bandage. It is used by folding it into a shape, and then using it to support a fractured or dislocated bone. Fold the triangle up into a long rectangle and tie it in a loop to create a sling. Alternatively, you can wrap it around a splint/bone to provide support. The uses of the triangle bandage will vary based on the injury, so use your discretion., To bandage second degree burns, use gauze rolls. Second degree burns cover an area wider than 3-inches and are blistered, red, swollen, and painful. While you should never attempt to bandage a third-degree burn, you should use gauze to bandage a second-degree burn. Wrap the sterile gauze loosely around the wound, and secure it with tape. The gauze will help block out irritants and infection, without cutting off circulation or applying pressure to the burn., On a deep cut or accidental amputation, tensor bandages are ideal. Tensor bandages are made of a thick elastic that helps to apply heavy pressure to severe bleeding. If you have a deep cut or accidental amputation, remove as much of the blood as possible, and then apply a thick layer of sterile gauze. Wrap the tensor bandage around the gauze to secure it in place and apply pressure to help minimize the bleeding.Try to position the injured area above the heart before bandaging, as this reduces blood flow and risk of shock. It also makes the tensor easier to apply.

Seek medical attention under certain conditions.",How to Remove a Splinter with Baking Soda," When cleaning or examining the area surrounding the splinter, you may be tempted to squeeze the surrounding skin to get a better look. This can cause the splinter to break into smaller fragments or become stuck deeper in the skin. Never squeeze the splinter or surrounding skin while removing the splinter., Use a magnifying glass if need be. See how big the splinter is and see the angle it's going into the skin. This can help you avoid pressing the splinter deeper into the skin when applying your paste and bandaid. Make sure not to press on the splinter in the direction it's angled into your skin.







, You want to make sure to avoid an infection when dealing with a splinter. Before you attempt to remove the splinter, clean the skin around the where the splinter is stuck. Wash your skin with hand soap and then gently pat the area dry with a paper towel.








Make sure to wash your hands before washing the skin around your splinter.

, In a small cup or other container, add a a generous amount of baking soda. Then, add in water in small increments and mix until you form a thick paste. There is no precise ratio of baking soda to water. You just need to add enough that you end up with a spreadable paste.







, Use your fingers or a paper towel to gently dab the paste over your splinter. Add a light layer of paste to the splinter and the surrounding skin.








Be careful not to push the splinter in deeper when applying the paste. Remember the angle in which it's driven into the skin and be gentle when applying baking soda at this angle.

, Place a Band-Aid over the paste. Make sure to cover the splinter completely with the cotton portion of the Band-Aid. The type of Band-Aid does not matter as long as it fits over the splinter.







, Wait anywhere from an hour to a day to remove the Band-Aid. Splinters that are stuck in deep will generally require more time. When you remove the bandaid, the splinter should come out easily.








If the splinter does not come out the first time, try repeating the process and leaving the bandaid on longer.

, It is a good idea to apply antibiotic ointment after removing the splinter. This will help prevent an infection. You can get an antibacterial ointment at any drug store. Apply the ointment as directed.








For example, use a cream from a drug store like Neosporin to cover the wound.If you're on existing medication, check with a pharmacist before selecting your ointment. You want to make sure the ointment you choose with not interfere with your current medication.

, Sometimes, your skin will bleed after you remove a splinter. Press firmly around the area where the splinter was. This will bring the skin together to patch up the wound and stop bleeding. You may also need to apply a bandaid.







, If a splinter will not come out and is causing heavy bleeding, you may need medical attention. You also may need medical attention for a splinter that's underneath a fingernail or toenail. If you are not up to date on your vaccinations, you should see a doctor if you get a splinter to make sure you don't need something like a tetanus shot to prevent infection.

Do not use instant glue. This may not come off of your skin and trap the splinter in your skin instead of removing it.You can also try using a wax hair remover or wax strips the same way that you would use glue.Wash and dry your hands and the area around your splinter before you begin.

, The glue must dry completely before you can remove it or it may not stick to the splinter. Leave the glue on your skin for about 30 minutes to an hour. Check it now and then to see if it is dry yet. When the glue is dry, it should not feel tacky or wet.

, After you are certain that the glue is dry, grasp the edge of the glue and pull it in the direction that the splinter entered your skin. Pull slowly and evenly. As you pull at the glue over your splinter, the splinter should come out.

, After you have peeled away the glue, look at the glue to see if the splinter is stuck in it. You should also check to see if any parts of the splinter are left in your skin. If so, then you may need to repeat the process or try a different splinter removal method.

Squeeze the wound gently.,
Control any bleeding.,
Disinfect the area.,
Bandage the wound.",How to Remove a Splinter4," When you’ve successfully removed the splinter, gently squeeze it until you see some blood. This will help to get some of the germs from the splinter out of your wound.Don’t squeeze too hard. If the wound doesn’t bleed with some gentle pressure, just leave it alone. You can use other methods to clean away germs and bacteria, including an antibacterial ointment.
Flushing the wound out with warm water for at least a minute will help clean the area.

, If the splinter continues to bleed after squeezing it or is bleeding on its own, then you can control the bleeding by placing pressure on the area.This can help prevent significant blood loss and shock.Bleeding from a minor wound should stop within a few minutes. If you are bleeding excessively, or the bleeding won’t stop, then seek medical attention right away.


Try holding a piece of gauze or a cotton ball on the splinter wound until the bleeding stops.
If the wound has split the skin, bring the edges of it together by pressing them together with two pieces of sterile gauze or clean cloth.You can also raise the area above your heart, which can help to control bleeding.For example, if the splinter was in your finger, then raise your hand above your head until the bleeding stops.

, Wash the splinter wound with soap and warm water after you’ve removed the splinter from your skin. This will help to clean away any lingering bacteria and germs left in the wound. After you are done, you may also want to apply an anti-bacterial ointment.Apply an antibacterial ointment to the area up to twice per day. This can minimize the risk of infection to the affected area.You can purchase an antibiotic ointment such as bacitracin, neomycin, or polymyxin B. Many brands will put the three into one product and call it “triple antibiotic ointment.”, After the bleeding has stopped and the wound is clean, you may want to cover the area to prevent bacteria from getting into the wound. You can secure a piece of gauze with some medical tape or apply a bandage to the injured area. A bandage may also add some pressure to help control bleeding."

Decide if you should remove your splinter at home or see a doctor.,
See your doctor or get emergency medical help for a severe splinter.,
Watch for signs of infection.,
Consider leaving the splinter alone.",How to Remove a Splinter5," Small splinters that are just under the surface of your skin are safe to remove at home.However, there are some situations where it may be necessary for a medical professional to remove your splinter.


If you are unsure about the nature of the splinter or it is causing you extreme pain, see your doctor as soon as possible.See your doctor for a splinter that is more than a quarter-inch (or half-centimeter) deep, as well as a splinter that is penetrating into muscles or by/on nerves.

, If your splinter is deeply embedded, causing severe pain, won’t come out, or even if you are reluctant to remove it yourself, see a doctor as soon as possible. This can help minimize your risk of serious infection or injury.Also see your doctor if:The splinter involves the eye.
The splinter will not come out easily.
The wound is deep and dirty.
Your last tetanus shot was more than five years ago.

, If you start to experience any signs of infection from the site on which you removed the splinter, see your doctor immediately. She can prescribe a course of treatment and remove and lingering bits of the splinter that you were not able to see.Signs of an infection include:Drainage from the site
Throbbing at the injury site
Redness or red streaks on the area
Fever

, If your splinter is tiny and not causing any pain, you may just want to leave it in your skin. Your skin may push out the splinter on its own. Your skin may also form a little pimple around the splinter and drain it this way.Keep the area clean and watch for signs of infections. If you see any redness, feel heat, or the area becomes painful, see your doctor."

Try to cough out the foreign object.,
Make a fist.,
Hold the fist with your other hand.,
Drive your fist in and up.,
Add force with a stable object.,
Repeat.",How to Perform the Heimlich Maneuver on Yourself," If you feel like you have something caught in your throat, you should try to cough it out. If you can cough forcefully enough to get it out, then you should not have to perform the Heimlich maneuver. If you cannot get the object out by coughing and are struggling for air, you need to act quickly, especially if you are alone.


You need to expel the obstruction before you lose consciousness.Even through the Heimlich maneuver, continue to intentionally cough.;
, To start getting ready to perform the Heimlich maneuver on yourself, you need to get your hands positioned correctly first. Make a fist with your strongest hand. Place it on your abdomen just above your navel and below your ribcage.


You need to make sure that your hand is in the right place so you can ensure that you don't hurt your ribs and are at the most opportune place for expelling the object.
This fist placement is the same as in the traditional Heimlich maneuver., Once you have your fist in place, you need to add your other hand for leverage. Open your other hand and place it over the fist you have on your stomach. You need to make sure that the fist is in the center of your hand.


This will allow you to push harder when you start the Heimlich maneuver., To try to get the foreign object dislodged, you need to push your fist and hand into your diaphragm or stomach area. Use a quick j-shaped motion, in and then up. Repeat multiple times.


If this does not dislodge the foreign object very quickly, you need to try to add more force with a stable object., In your immediate area, you need to find a stable object that is about waist high that you can bend over. A chair, a table, or a counter top will work well for this. With your hands still clasped in front of you, bend over the chair, table, counter, or other solid object. Brace your fists between the chair and your abdomen and drive your body against the solid object.


This will greatly increase the force you apply to your diaphragm, which will be more effective to help dislodge seriously stuck foreign objects., You may not be able to dislodge the object during the first try. You need to quickly repeat pushing yourself onto the stable object until the object is removed. You should return to normal breathing once it is removed. Although it is very scary, it is better if you stay calm. Panicking will only increase your heart rate and need for air, which will make it worse.
Once you have it dislodged, sit down and catch your breath.
If you find that you are uncomfortable or your throat is sore, you may need to see your doctor.If you cannot get it dislodged, call 911."

Position your body.,
Compress the nose.,
Cool yourself down.,
Use oxymetazoline nasal sprays.,
Wash your nose and rest.",How to Stop a Nose Bleed1," If you do not have a serious issue that led to your nose bleed, you can perform some first aid at home during a nose bleed to help stop it. To begin, sit down, since it is more comfortable than standing. Tilt head forward so that the blood drains through the nostrils.


A towel can be held under your nose to collect the blood.
Do not lie down as this can cause blood to pass down the throat.;
, With a finger and thumb, pinch the lower fleshy end of the nose, completely blocking the nostrils. Pinching at this point directly applies pressure at the region where the blood vessels are damaged. This makes the move more effective since it will help stop the flow of blood. Keep pinching the nose for 10 minutes, then release.


If bleeding continues, reapply pressure for another 10 minutes.
While you do this, breathe through the mouth.

, Lowering your body temperature can help reduce the blood flow to your nose. To do this, place ice cubes in your mouth. This helps achieve a lower temperature sooner than cooling the external part of the nose. It also will help you retain the lower temperature for longer.


This is more effective than placing a cold compress over the nose. Cold compresses placed over the nose are not very effective according to a recent clinical study.
You can also suck on a popsicle to achieve the same result., While you have a nose bleed but not on a regular basis, you can try a medicated nose spray if you do not have high blood pressure issues. This medication causes constriction of the blood vessels in your nose. To use, take a small clean cotton ball or gauze piece, add 1-2 drops of the spray to it, insert them into the nostrils, continue pinching the nostrils, and check for bleeding after 10 minutes.If bleeding has stopped, do not remove the cotton or gauze for about an hour, because bleeding can reoccur.
Frequent use of this drug, which is more than 3-4 days at a time, can cause addiction and nasal congestion.These sprays are used only if bleeding does not stop on pinching the nose after the first 10 minutes.

, After bleeding has stopped, you can clean the area around your nose with warm water. After you have cleaned your face, you should rest for a while. This is to help to prevent further bleeding.


You can lie down while resting.

Be gentle on your nose.,
Buy a humidifier.,
Increase your fiber intake.,
Eat fiber to keep stools soft.,
Use saline nasal sprays.,
Eat more flavonoids.",How to Stop a Nose Bleed2," Since nose bleeds can be caused by personal actions, there are some preventative methods that will help you prevent nose bleeds in the future. You should avoid picking your nose. Picking can cause an injury to the inner sensitive blood vessels of the nose. It can also detach the blood clots covering previously injured blood vessels and cause further bleeding. You should also keep your mouth open while sneezing to prevent expulsion of air through the nose.


You should keep the inner lining of your nose moist by gently apply a coating of petroleum jelly or nasal gel inside your nose with a cotton swab twice a day.Always blow your nose gently and do it one side at a time.
You should also clip the fingernails of children to avoid further injury.

, To increase the humidity in your environment, you should buy a humidifier. You can use a humidifier at home or work to prevent excessive dryness, especially in the wintertime.


If you do not have a humidifier, a metal container with water can be placed on top of heating radiators to humidify the air.

, Constipation can lead to bearing down to pass hard stool, which causes an increase in nose bleeds because it strains your blood vessels. This can increase arterial pressure momentarily and dislodge blood clots covering previously injured blood vessels, which can eventually result in further nose bleeds. Constipation can be prevented by eating foods high in fiber and increasing your fluid intake.

, Do not bear down during bowel movements, since this increases the intra-cerebral arterial pressure thereby increasing the chance of small sensitive blood vessel rupture in the noseEating 6 to 12 prunes a day are more effective than dietary fibers and can be used to prevent constipation.You should also avoid hot and spicy foods. Heat can dilate blood vessels and precipitate bleeding., Saline nose sprays can be used several times each day to keep the nose moist.These nasal sprays are not addictive as they only contain salt. If you don't want to buy them, you can make your own.


To make your own, take a clean container. Mix 3 heaping teaspoons of iodide-free salt and 1 rounded teaspoon of baking soda. Mix both the powders together. Then take 1 teaspoon of the powdered mixture and add it to 8 ounces of lukewarm distilled or boiled water. Mix well., Flavonoids, which are a group of natural chemical compounds present in citrus fruits, can improve fragility of blood capillaries.Because of this, you should consider increasing your consumption of citrus fruits. Other foods with a high flavonoid content include parsley, onions, blueberries and other berries, black tea, green tea and oolong tea, bananas, all citrus fruits, Ginkgo biloba, red wine, sea-buckthorns, and dark chocolate (with a cocoa content of 70% or greater).


You should not take flavonoid supplements, such as ginkgo pills, quercetin tablets, grape seed extract, and flaxseed, because they result in a higher flavonoid content and eventual toxicity."

Learn the types of nose bleeds.,
Know the causes.,
Avoid certain situations.,
Visit the doctor.",How to Stop a Nose Bleed3," The types of nose bleeds rely on which part of the nose the bleeding comes from. In anterior nose bleeds, bleeding arises in the front part of the nose. You can also have a posterior nose bleeds, where bleeding originates in the inner part of the nose. Nose bleeds can also be spontaneous with an unidentifiable cause., There are many causes for nose bleeds. When you get one, you should assess which of the causes is most likely the reason you got your nose bleed and avoid the situation if at all possible in the future. You can get a nose bleed because of self-induced trauma, mostly as a result of nasal picking. This is the most common cause in young children. Other causes include substance abuse of drugs such as cocaine, blood vessel disorders, blood clotting disorders, and trauma to the head or face.


Environmental factors such as low humidity, which is common during the winter, can induce mucosal irritation and bleeding. The incidence of nasal bleeding increases in colder weather.
Infections of the nose and sinuses can cause a nose bleed. Allergies can also cause mucosal inflammation, which leads to nose bleeds.
In some special cases, migraine headaches in children have also been proposed as a causative.Trauma to the face can also cause a nose bleed to occur.

, If you get a nose bleed, you should avoid certain situations and actions which may make it worse. Do not lean backwards. This may cause blood to run down your throat, which could induce vomiting. You should also avoid speaking and coughing. This can irritate the nasal mucosa and re-bleeding can occur.


If you have to sneeze while your nose is bleeding, you should try to expel the air through your mouth so you don't further hurt your nose or cause more bleeding.
Do not blow or pick the nose, especially if the bleeding is decreasing. You can dislodge formed blood clots and bleeding can reoccur.

, There are certain situations when you need to visit a doctor. If the bleeding is severe, more than a few drops, lasts more than 30 minutes, and reoccurs frequently, you should see a doctor.You also need to seek medical attention if you become extremely pale, fatigued, or disoriented. This can occur as a result of significant blood loss.


If you have difficulty breathing, especially if blood passes down your throat, you need to see a doctor. This can lead to irritation and coughing. There is a chance of infection as a result, which can eventually cause breathing issues.
You should always see a doctor if the nose bleed began as a result of severe injury to the nose.You should also see a doctor if you have a nose bleed while you are taking medicine that prevents blood clotting, such as warfarin, clopidogrel, or a daily aspirin."

Remove the victim from the water.,
Take swimming lessons.,
Swim only in designated and protected areas.,
Stick with a buddy.,
Wear approved life jackets.,
Remain cautious around water.,
Remember alcohol and water don’t mix.",How to Recognize That Someone Is Drowning," Although both responses are serious, knowing how to tell the difference between a person who is in aquatic distress and someone who is drowning may help you to more easily ascertain a person who is in acute danger and requires immediate help., Someone who is experiencing aquatic distress displays symptoms many people generally associate with drowning. Aquatic distress is no less serious than drowning, but it generally doesn’t last long and the person can assist in his own rescue by grabbing lifelines or throw rings.Signs of aquatic distress include:


the victim’s head is low in the water, with his mouth at water level.
he may tilt her head back with his mouth open
he may have glassy or empty eyes that are unable to focus
his hair may obstruct his view and he makes no attempt to move it
he fails to kick with or move his legs and is in vertical position in the water
he may be hyperventilating or gasping for air
he may try to swim without making any real headway
he may try to roll over on to his back
he may appear to be climbing an invisible ladder., In contrast to drowning scenes shown in the movies or on TV shows, the signs of drowning are often quite subtle and may not appear to be serious. This is because of the Instinctive Drowning Response, which Dr. Francesco Pia identified as the ways in which a person tries to avoid suffocating in the water. Observing the signs of the Instinctive Drowning Response can help you to identify someone who is drowning and get help to her immediately.A person who is drowning:


is likely silent. A drowning person is almost always unable to call for help. There are some cases, however, in which a drowning individual can shout.
may hold her mouth below the surface of the water or alternate between the surface and under the water. This makes it difficult for her to inhale or exhale.
cannot wave or signal because the natural instinct is to press down on the water surface to lift him up for a breath.
is also unable to control his arm movements, which make it difficult for him to swim to a rescuer or grab on to a lifeline.
he will be vertical in the water and not show any signs of kicking.A victim exhibiting these signs only has about 20-60 seconds before she is submerged underwater., About 20% of drowning victims are children under the age of 14.The signs of a child drowning are similar to those for adults, but there are some additional signals for which you can watch. These include:


Silence. Most children will splash and yell when playing in the water, if your child or the children you are with become quiet, check to make sure they are safe.
Knocked down or failed barriers. If you have a pool at home that is fenced in, a failed gate or other barriers may indicate that your child accessed the pool area and is in need of immediate assistance.Remember that your child can also drown in the bath, so make sure that you watch them at all times, even around the shallowest bodies of water.If you have an underwater pool alarm and it goes off, it may be a sign of your child in distress., Although relatively uncommon, dry drowning can happen when children ingest a small amount of water that sends their airways into distress.Watching for the signs of dry drowning can save a child’s life or from serious medical issues. Be on the lookout for:


Any child rescued from the water. Dry drowning can occur even if a child is rescued so contact emergency personnel or call your doctor immediately.
Persistent coughing.
Labored, rapid, and shallow breathing. You may see flared nostrils or space between their ribs or a gap above the child’s collarbone in this case.
Sleepiness.
Changes in behavior, including forgetfulness.
Vomiting., Whether or not a person is in aquatic distress or drowning or even if you suspect either of these contingencies, it’s important to take action to help the person as soon as possible. This can help minimize the risk of accidental drowning or brain damage from being underwater too long.The best way to see if a person needs help is to ask “are you ok?”If the person can answer, chances are they are ok. If the person does not answer, however, get yourself or a lifeguard to the person immediately., If you are at a location that does not have a trained or certified lifeguard, do you best to help the person. Not only are you legally required to assist someone in need if it doesn’t endanger you, but you are also protected if you do assist them under provisions of the Good Samaritan Law and Volunteer Protection Act.Call emergency medical services immediately to get help with the situation.
If you are unable to swim, try and get the attention of someone who can or find a lifeline that you can throw to the person. It is not worth risking the lives of two people.
If the situation is dangerous, for example because of lightning or high waves, do not attempt to rescue a person.
Remember that it is always better to err on the side of caution than ignoring a questionable situation. For example, if you are not sure that a person is drowning, try and help them if you can. On the other hand, if a situation puts you or your life in danger such as a live wire close to water, as difficult as it may be, don’t attempt a rescue.

, If the victim is conscious and at the surface of the water, try using a reaching assist with a lifeline to help them. This puts you in less overall danger and may minimize the risk of drowning.Find any type of device that a person can grab on to. This could be a shepherd’s crook, life ring, or even a long tree branch. Some pools have a long metal pole for the person the hold.You can also extend your hand or wrist to the person as an assist.Keep your body low to the ground so that the person doesn’t pull you into the water., If a person cannot reach an assistance device or is unconscious, approach them in the water., It’s important to be aware that a person may panic in this situation and can injure you or make it difficult to help them. This is a real hazard and can lead to both rescuer and victim drowning.


It’s best to approach the victim from behind. Panicky people will grab at whatever is floating - and this includes would-be rescuers. This can possibly leading to two drowning deaths. Make sure to communicate with the person and let them know you are there. Sometimes this will encourage a person to come your direction.
The easiest way to rescue the person is to place your hands under the armpits and pull them to safety.

Avoid physical contact with a panicky swimmer, if at all possible. A panicked swimmer may grab at anything that floats, including you. This may not be a problem if the person is a 3 years old, but even a small woman can easily pull down an adult. Bring a flotation device if at all possible.

, Once you’ve pulled the person to safety, remove him from the water. This can help you prepare to take other emergency measures such as CPR or wrapping him in a towel to prevent shock.Make sure that you or someone else has called emergency medical services to aid your in your efforts to help the person., Make sure that you and every member of your family takes swim lessons and become proficient swimmers. This can minimize the risk of accidental drowning, especially in children.Contact a local pool or school to inquire about swim lessons.Learning to swim will also teach you to not fear the water, which can also minimize your risk for drowning.

, Whether you are at the beach, pond, or a pool, only swim in those areas designated safe either by a lifeguard or local authorities. If you are unsure of a swimming area, it’s always best to err on the side of caution and go to a known swimming spot, which may help prevent accidental drownings.Bodies of water can have currents, riptides, and other features that can be dangerous for even the best and strongest of swimmers.Staying within designated areas can also mean that help can more effectively and quickly get to your aid in the event you or another person are in distress.

, Having someone to swim with is not only a great time, but it also adds a measure of security. Always swim with a buddy to help ensure your safety.If you cannot find a buddy with whom to swim, consider either going to an area where there is a lifeguard on duty or try another activity until you have a swimming companion.Remember that you can drown or go into distress even at a guarded beach or pool., If you are boating or undertaking other types of water activities, wear life jacket approved by the U.S. Coast Guard. Although this is not a fail-proof way to prevent drowning, it can minimize the risk of accidental drowning or extend the person’s ability to stay afloat—and breathing—in the water.Only purchase certified or approved life jacket. These have been tested for maximum safety and may prove better at preventing accidental drowning.
You can buy life jackets at many sports stores, boat stores, or even from some medical supply stores.

, No matter how strong of a swimmer you are, or if you are not planning on swimming, be cautious around water. Natural bodies of water often have tides, cold temperatures, currents, and other underwater hazards such as dead trees that could increase your risk for drowning.If there is a lifeguard present, consider asking if he is aware of any natural features of which you should be aware.
In many cases, bodies of water that have lifeguards will mark off areas that have potentially dangerous natural features.

, Although many people think they can safely drink and be on a boat or go for a swim, it’s important to avoid mixing alcohol use and the water activities. This can minimize the risk that you or someone in your party drowns or injures himself.Alcohol not only impairs your judgment, but also inhibits your balance and coordination. This can weaken your swimming skills.Alcohol further reduces your body’s ability to stay warm, making you more prone to hypothermia, which can also increase your risk of drowning."

Discover where the blood is coming from.,
Apply pressure to the wound.,
Calm the injured person down.,
Select the appropriate material.,
Apply the tourniquet between the heart and injury.,
Use a stick or rod for tightening.,
Don't leave the tourniquet on too long.,
Keep the wound as clean as you can.,
Provide warmth and hydration.",How to Apply a Tourniquet," If you find yourself in an emergency situation where someone (or animal) is severely injured and bleeding, approach with confidence and reassurance. Helping someone in a life threatening situation is brave, but you must try to discover and assess the injury as quickly as you can. Have the person lay down and find out where the blood is coming. Tourniquets only work on limb injuries, not trauma to the head or torso.Injuries to the head and torso require applied pressure with some absorptive material in order to slow or stop bleeding, not a tourniquet.


A severely injured person may also require basic life-saving measures, such as CPR (clearing airways, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) and shock prevention.
The term ""tourniquet"" originated in the late 1600s from the French word ""tourner,"" which means to turn or tighten.;
, The majority of external bleeding injuries can be controlled by direct pressure.Therefore, grab something absorptive and preferably clean such as a sterile gauze pad (although it may have to be your own shirt) and place it over the wound while applying significant pressure. The aim is to plug the wound and promote blood clotting, because blood will not coagulate while freely flowing. Gauze pads (or something absorptive such as terrycloth or cotton fabric) work well to prevent the blood from escaping the wound. If the gauze, towel, or article of clothing soaks through with blood, add another layer — don't take off the original make-shift bandage. Peeling off a blood soaked bandage from the wound removes the quickly forming clotting factors and encourages bleeding to resume. However, if the wound is too severe and the bleeding cannot be stopped with applied pressure, then (and only then) should you consider a tourniquet.


If left uncontrolled, bleeding will eventually lead to shock, then death.
If at all possible, use latex or similar types of gloves while in contact with the blood of another person as it will help stop the transmission of certain diseases.
Even if you have to use a tourniquet, leave the make-shift bandage on the wound because it will help promote clotting when the blood flow slows down.Elevate the wound if possible. Often the combination of pressure and reducing the pull of gravity on the flow of blood in the vessels will be enough to stop the bleeding and allow clot formation.

, In any emergency situation, panic is a detriment, so try to calm the person down in a reassuring tone. Prevent him from looking at his wound and the bleeding if you can, as many people don't like the sight of blood and assume the worst case scenario.You should inform him of your actions though, such as when you apply a bandage and/or a tourniquet. It's also important for the person to know that medical help is on the way.


Try to make a quick 911 emergency phone call (or ask a bystander) as soon as you are able. In most severe injuries, the use of a bandage and/or tourniquet is merely buying time so that trained medical personnel can take over and do what's necessary.
Make the injured person as comfortable as possible while you're giving him help. Put something padded underneath his head.

, If you have a well-designed medical tourniquet at your disposal then that's great, but in most emergency situations you'll have to improvise. In the absence of a specially designed tourniquet, choose something that is strong and pliable (although not too stretchy), but long enough to tie around the injured limb.Good choices would be a necktie, bandana, leather belt, straps from knapsack or handbag, cotton shirt or long socking.


To minimize cutting into the skin, ensure that the improvised tourniquet is at least an inch wide and preferable two to three inches in width. However, it the tourniquet is for a finger, a somewhat smaller width is fine, but avoid string, twine, dental floss, wire, etc.
In an emergency situation with lots of blood, you need to resign yourself to the fact that you'll be getting blood on your clothes, so don't hesitate to use an article of clothing for a tourniquet.

, Place your tourniquet around the injured limb, between the open wound and the heart (or proximal to the wound) — the purpose is to cut off the strong blood flow within arteries leaving the heart, not the more superficial veins returning blood back to the heart.More specifically, place your tourniquet about two to four inches away from the edge of the wound. Don't place it directly over the wound because the arteries upstream from the injury will still drain into and out from the open wound.


For wounds that are just below a joint (such as the elbow or knee), place your tourniquet just above and as close to the joint as you can.
Your tourniquet should have some padding underneath it to prevent skin damage, so use the victim's clothing (pant leg or shirt sleeve) to place under it if you can.
If your tourniquet is long enough, wrap it around the injured limb numerous times, keeping it as flat as possible. You want the tourniquet to stop blood flow in the arteries, but not cut into and damage any soft tissues while doing so.

, Tying a regular knot after you have tightly wrapped your tourniquet may not be sufficient to control the flow of blood, especially if the material expands a little when wet. As such, use some sort of elongated wooden or plastic stick or rod (at least four inches long) as a torsion device. First, tie a half-knot with the tourniquet, then place the rigid object on top before tying a full knot over it.You can then twist the elongated object until the tourniquet is tight around the injured limb and the bleeding stops.


Small tree branches, a screwdriver or wrench, thin flashlights, or thick marker pens all work well as torsion devices for tourniquets.

, Tourniquet use is temporary and short-term only, although there is no research that indicates exactly the time limit before the lack of blood supply starts to cause tissue death (necrosis), as all people are physiologically a little different.If necrosis sets in, then leg amputation is very likely. As a general guideline, two hours is considered the length of time a tourniquet can be tied before neuromuscular injury begins (loss of normal function) and perhaps three to four hours before necrosis becomes a serious concern.However, in an emergency situation with no medical help close by, you may have to make the choice of sacrificing a limb to save a life.


If you think medical help will take longer than two hours to arrive, then cool the limb down with ice or cold water (while elevated) if you can — it may help delay tissue injury and loss of function.
Mark the victim's forehead with a ""T"" to indicate a tourniquet has been applied and also note the time when it was applied so medical personnel know.

, Ideally, your tourniquet will stop or considerably slow down the flow of arterial blood from the wound, although you should still take care to prevent any debris from landing on the injury. Any open wound is at risk of infection.Before applying a pressure bandage, rinsing the wound with clean water is a good idea, but once the gauze or bandage is applied you shouldn't remove it. However, you can prevent debris from landing on the make-shift bandage by covering it with a blanket or article of clothing.


If you don't have any latex gloves to wear, look around or ask any bystanders for some hand sanitizer before you touch the wound.
If you have sterile saline available, this is the best for cleaning wounds. Otherwise, alcohol, vinegar, natural honey, hydrogen peroxide and bleach are all good antiseptics that may be available for you to use on your hands or the victim's injury before you dress it.

, If medical help is delayed for whatever reason, then the victim is likely to experience some shivering and severe thirst from blood loss, the degree to which depends on the environmental conditions and amount of lost blood. As such, find a blanket or some clothing to keep the victim warm and give her water or juice to drink. Shivering may also be a sign of hypovolemic shock, which also causes rapid breathing, confusion, anxiety, clammy skin, bluish coloring, and loss of consciousness.There may not be much you can do to prevent shock, but you can tell the medical personnel your observations when they arrive.


The greater and more rapid the loss of blood, the more severe the shock symptoms.
Post-tourniquet syndrome typically lasts from one to six weeks and includes weakness, numbness, pallor, and stiffness in the injured limb."

Seek immediate medical attention.",How to Perform the Heimlich Maneuver on a Toddler," When someone is choking, they'll lose the ability to speak because air can't get through. Therefore, if you ask your toddler a question and she can't reply, she may be choking., You may notice that he's having trouble drawing breaths. He may also be making weird noises when he's breathing,such as a high-pitched noise when drawing in a breath., Your toddler may be trying to cough up what's in her throat and failing. Therefore, the cough will be weak. A heavy cough likely indicates that enough air is getting through that she's not choking., Toddlers who aren't breathing may start turning blue around the edges. For instance, you may notice bluish or dusky tinges on her fingernails, lips, or skin.However, be aware that children and toddlers compensate much better than adults and may not turn blue as fast as an adult would.

, If the child is able to speak or breathe well, don't start Heimlich. The same goes if the child is able to cough hard. However, be watching to make sure the symptoms don't suddenly worsen., Choking can cause a toddler to pass out. See if he can look at you when you talk by asking him a question. You'll likely need this information when you call 911.You'll also need to move on to the steps for an unconscious choking toddler if he's not conscious.


You can also lightly flick the bottom of a toddler's foot to check for consciousness., If you are not alone with the child, ask someone to call 911.If you are, you should try the Heimlich maneuver before calling 911. , If a parent is present, quickly ask for consent. Seconds count when saving a life. If a parent is not present, Good Samaritan laws in your state should cover any action you take in good faith to save the child's life., Have the child bend over at the waist. Place your hand under her chest for support.To perform this maneuver properly on a child, you'll likely need to kneel on the floor.Don't try to pull the object out of the child's mouth if the child is conscious. Try to get it out with the Heimlich maneuver instead.You can also place a child across your lap face down, if that is more feasible., Use the heel of your hand. Whack the child on the back directly between the shoulder blades five times.These blows should be fairly hard. They shouldn't be hard enough to knock the child over with your support, but they do need to be relatively sharp.The American Heart Association doesn't teach back blows when performing the Heimlich; the Heimlich alone (abdominal thrusts) can be effective without them.Look to see if the object has dislodged. You may see the object fly out, or you may notice the child has started breathing again., Put your arms around the child. Use one hand to make a fist and place it directly above the child's navel. Try to get below the breastbone. Cover your fist with the other hand., Pull your fists upward into the child's abdomen. Make this thrust quickly. Repeat four times or until you notice the object choking the child dislodges., If no one is around and you've tried the Heimlich once, be sure to call 911. You want help to be on the way. If you asked someone else to call 911, make sure the person has done it., If it didn't work, continue moving back and forth between back blows and abdominal thrusts. Keep going until you see the object come out, the child begins to breathe normally again, or the child becomes unconscious., Once the child loses consciousness, place him on the floor on his back. He should be on a flat, hard surface. Make sure to do so gently., Do a sweep of the child's mouth. Gently tilt her head to the side and open her mouth, and use a finger to sweep out an object if you see one.Only try to remove the object if it's loose; if it's stuck in the child's throat, don't try to move it, as you can push it further down., Tilt the child's head back to open up the airway by lifting the chin. Hold his nose so air can't escape. Cover his mouth with your mouth and blow air in twice, blowing for about a second each time. Watch his chest to see if it rises. If it doesn't, move on to chest compressions.If you're having trouble pinching his nose and covering his mouth with yours, you can try to cover his nose and mouth with your mouth., Find the correct place by feeling where the bottom of the ribs meet. You should be about an inch above that on the child's chest. Put one hand on top of the other, flat on the chest. The heel of your hand should be in the center of the child's chest. Push the chest about 1/3 of the way down, depth-wise (about 2 inches). Try to go quickly; you should be aiming for 100 compressions a minute. Count to 30 compressions., Your chest compressions could have dislodged the object that was choking the child. Open her mouth and look. Use your finger to sweep out any object. Check to see if the child is breathing by watching her chest., Continue switching between two rescue breaths and thirty chest compressions, checking for an object in the mouth in between. Always remember to tilt the child's chin up for the rescue breaths. Keep going until the child's condition changes or help arrives to take over., Even once the child has recovered, take him to the doctor anyway. You want to make sure he/she's suffered no permanent damage.

Assess the injured area.,
Call for emergency help if the injury is severe.,
Provide CPR if necessary.,
Stop any bleeding.,
Immobilize the broken bone.,
Apply ice to the injury.,
Keep calm and watch for signs of shock.,
Consider pain medication.",How to Provide First Aid for a Broken Bone," In an emergency situation with no trained medical people around, you need to quickly assess the seriousness of the injury. Trauma from a fall or accident coupled with severe pain is not a guarantee of a broken bone, but it's usually a pretty good indicator. Fractures involving the head, spine or pelvis are difficult to tell without an x-ray, but you suspect a break in one of these areas you should not attempt to move the person. Bones in the arms, legs, fingers, and toes will typically look crooked, misshapen or obviously out of place when broken.A severely broken bone might poke out through the skin (open fracture) and involve profuse bleeding.


Other common symptoms of broken bones include: limited use of the injured area (reduced mobility or unable to put any weight on it), immediate local swelling and bruising, numbness or tingling downstream from the break, shortness of breath, nausea.
Be very careful when assessing the injury not to cause much movement. Moving a person with an injured spine, neck, pelvis or skull is very risky without medical training and should be avoided.;
, Once you've established that the injury is serious and suspect that a broken bone is likely, then call 9-1-1 for an ambulance and get professional medical help on their way as quickly as you can.Providing immediate rudimentary first aid and supportive care are certainly helpful, but it's no substitute for trained medical attention. If you are close to a hospital or emergency clinic and are quite certain the injury is not life threatening and only involves a limb, then consider driving the injured person to the facility.


Even if you think your fracture is not life threatening, resist the urge to drive yourself to the hospital. You may not be able to operate your vehicle properly or may lose consciousness from the pain and become a road hazard.
If the injury appears severe, stay on the line with the 9-1-1 dispatcher in case conditions get worse in order to get helpful instructions and emotional support.
Call emergency services if you notice the following: call for emergency help if The person is unresponsive, isn't breathing, or isn't moving; there is heavy bleeding; gentle pressure or movement causes pain; the limb or joint appears deformed; the bone has pierced the skin; the extremity of the injured arm or leg, such as a toe or finger, is numb or bluish at the tip; you suspect a bone is broken in the neck, head or back., If the injured person is not breathing and you can't feel a pulse on her wrists or neck, then start administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (if you know how to) before the ambulance arrives.CPR involves clearing the airways, blowing air into the mouth / lungs and trying to restart the heart by rhythmically pushing on the chest.


A lack of oxygen for much more than five to seven minutes causes, at least, some degree of brain damage, so time is of the essence.
If you're not trained in CPR, then provide hands-only CPR — uninterrupted chest compressions at a rate of about 100 per minute until paramedics arrive.If you're well-trained in CPR, begin with chest compressions immediately (about 20 – 30) and then check the airway for obstruction and start doing rescue breathing after tilting the head back at a slight angle.For a spine, neck, or skull injury, do not use the head-tilt-chin-lift method. Use the jaw-thrust method of airway opening, but only if you have been trained how to do so. The jaw-thrust method involves kneeling behind the person and placing a hand on either side of her face, middle and index fingers beneath and behind the jaw. Push each side of the jaw forward until it juts out.

, If the injury is bleeding significantly (more than a few drops), then you must attempt to stop it regardless if there is a fracture or not. Significant bleeding from the main artery can lead to death within a few minutes. Controlling the bleeding is a higher priority than addressing a broken bone. Apply firm pressure to the wound with a sterile and absorbent bandage (ideally), although a clean towel or piece of clothing will do in an emergency.Hold it there for a few minutes to encourage the blood to clot at the injury site. Secure the bandage around the wound with an elastic bandage or piece of cloth if you can.


If the bleeding won't stop from an injured limb, you may have to tie a tight tourniquet above the wound to temporarily cut off the circulation until medical help arrives. A tourniquet can be made of virtually anything that can be secured tight — string, rope, cord, rubber tubing, leather belt, necktie, scarf, tee-shirt, etc.
If there is a large object penetrating into the skin, do not remove it. It may be clotting the wound, and removing it could cause severe bleeding.

, After the injured person is stabilized, it's time to immobilize the broken bone if you anticipate a wait of an hour or longer for emergency medical personnel.Immobilizing it can help reduce the pain and protect the broken bone from further injury caused by inadvertent movement. If you don't have proper training, don't try to realign the bone. Attempting to align broken bones improperly can lead to further damage to blood vessels and nerves, leading to potential bleeding and potential paralysis. Keep in mind that splints only work for limb bones, not those of the pelvis or torso.


The best method of immobilization is to make a simple splint. Place a piece of stiff cardboard or plastic, a branch or stick, a metal rod, or rolled up newspaper/magazine on either side of the injury to support the bone.Tie these supports together firmly with tape, string, rope, cord, rubber tubing, leather belt, necktie, scarf, etc.
When splinting a fractured bone, try to allow movement in the adjacent joints and don't secure it too tight — allow appropriate blood circulation.
Splinting may not be necessary if emergency services are coming right away. In this case, splinting may cause more harm than good if you don't have the appropriate training.

, Once the broken bone is immobilized, apply something cold (preferably ice) to it as soon as you can while you wait for the ambulance. Cold therapy has many benefits, including numbing the pain, reducing inflammation / swelling and reducing bleeding by causing the arteries to constrict.If you don't have ice handy, consider using frozen gel packs or bags of vegetables, but make sure to wrap anything cold in a thin cloth in order to avoid ice burn or frostbite.


Apply ice for about 20 minutes or until the area is completely numb before removing it. Compressing it against the injury may help reduce swelling even more as long as it doesn't increase the pain.
While applying the ice, make sure the broken bone is elevated in order to combat swelling and slow down bleeding (if applicable).

, Breaking a bone is very traumatic and painful. Fear, panic, and shock are all common reactions, but they can have negative consequences for the body, so they must be controlled. As such, calm yourself and/or the injured person by reassuring him that help is on the way and the situation is under control. As you wait for help, cover the person to keep him warm and hydrate him if they are thirsty. Keep talking to him to distract him from focusing on his injury.


Signs of shock include: feeling faint / dizzy, pale complexion, cold sweats, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, confusion, irrational panic.If it looks like the person is in shock, lay him down with his head supported and elevate his legs. Keep him covered with a blanket or jacket, or even a table cloth if those things are not available.
Shock is dangerous because blood and oxygen are routed away from vital organs.This physiological state, if left untreated, can ultimately cause organ damage.

, If the wait for emergency medical personnel is longer than an hour (or you anticipate it being a long wait), then consider taking / giving some medication, if you have any, to control the pain and make the wait more tolerable. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is the painkiller most appropriate for broken bones and other internal injuries because it doesn't ""thin"" the blood and promote more bleeding.Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil) are helpful for pain and inflammation, but they inhibit blood clotting, so they aren't a good idea for internal injuries such as broken bones.
In addition, aspirin and ibuprofen should not be given to young children, because they may cause dangerous side effects.

Understand the difference between a stroke and a mini-stroke.,
Look for two or more symptoms of a stroke.,
Do the F.A.S.T test.,
Call 911 for medical help as soon as possible.,
Allow the doctor to do tests and a check up.,
Discuss treatment options with the doctor.",How to Identify if Someone Had a Stroke," There are two major types of strokes: an ischemic stroke, which is caused by a blood clot in your brain, and a hemorrhagic stroke, caused by a blood vessel in your brain that breaks and bleeds into the brain. Hemorrhagic strokes are rarer than ischemic strokes, as only about 20 percent of strokes are hemorrhagic.Both types of strokes are serious and can be life threatening if the person is not treated as soon as possible.


Mini-strokes, also called transient ischemic attacks (TIA), occur when your brain gets less blood than normal. They can last from a few minutes up to a day. Many people who experience mini-strokes do not even realize they have had a stroke, but mini-strokes can be a warning sign of a full stroke. If someone experiences a mini-stroke, they should receive medical attention right away.;
, Most people suffering from a stroke will exhibit two or more of the most common symptoms of a stroke, including:Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg on one side of their body.
Sudden difficulty seeing out of one or both eyes.
Sudden difficulty walking, as well as dizziness and loss of balance.
Sudden confusion and difficulty talking or understanding someone talking to them.
Sudden bad headache with no clear cause.

, It can be difficult for someone suffering from a stroke to describe or explain their symptoms. To confirm the person is having a stroke, you can do a quick test, called the F.A.S.T. test:Face - Ask the person to smile. Check if one side of their face droops or appears numb. Their smile may appear uneven or lopsided on one side of their face.
Arms - Ask the person to raise both arms. If they cannot lift their arms, or if one arm drifts downward, they are likely suffering from a stroke.
Speech - Ask the person a simple question, like their name or their age. Note if their words are slurred when they respond to you or if they have difficulty forming words.
Time - If the person displays any of these symptoms, it is time to call 911. You should also check the time to confirm when the person’s symptoms first appeared, as the medical staff will use this information to better care for the person.

, Once you confirm the person is having a stroke, you need to take immediate action and call 911. You should then tell the dispatcher that the person is having a stroke and requires immediate medical attention. A stroke is considered a medical emergency, as the longer blood flow is cut off to the brain, the greater the damage to the brain., Once you get the stroke victim to a hospital, the doctor will ask the person questions, such as what happened and when they first started experiencing symptoms. These questions will help the doctor determine if the person is thinking clearly and how severe the stroke is. The doctor will also test the person’s reflexes and order several test, including:Imaging tests: These tests will provide a clear picture of the person’s brain, including CT scans and MRI scanning. They will help the doctor determine if the stroke was caused by a blockage or by bleeding in the brain.
Electrical tests: You will probably be given an EEG (electroencephalogram) to record the electrical impulses and the sensory processes of the brain, and an EKG (electrocardiogram) to measure the electrical activity of the heart.Blood flow tests: These tests will show any changes to blood flow to the brain that may be occurring.

, Some strokes can be treated with a drug called tPA, which dissolves blood clots that are obstructing blood flow to the brain. However, the window of opportunity for treatment is three hours, and the treatment has specific guidelines for its application.It is essential that the person get to a hospital within 60 minutes of the stroke to be evaluated and receive this treatment.A recent study by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes (NINDS) found that some stroke patients who received tPA within three hours of the beginning of their stroke symptoms were 30 percent more likely to recover with little to no disability after three months.
If the person cannot have tPA, the doctor may prescribe an antiplatelet medicine or a blood thinner for a TIA, or mini-stroke.If the person has had a hemorrhagic stroke, the doctor may prescribe medication to lower their blood pressure. She may also take the person off any antiplatelet medications or blood thinners.
Surgery is a treatment option in some cases.

Determine if the baby can cough.,
Check if the baby is breathing.,
Call Emergency Services.,
Prepare to give back blows.,
Give five firm back blows.,
Prepare to perform chest thrusts.,
Give five chest thrusts.,
Monitor your baby after the airway is cleared.",How to Perform the Heimlich Maneuver on a Baby," The first thing to do when you see a baby struggling to breathe is check whether she can cough or make sounds. If she can cough firmly, then let her cough to try and dislodge the object that is obstructing her breathing. If you are worried about her breathing and she cannot dislodge the object through coughing you should call for emergency medical help.If your baby can cough forcefully or cry strongly do not attempt the following steps to dislodge it. Instead, monitor her closely until you know the blockage has been dislodged. Be ready to act if the symptoms worsen and persist.;
, If the baby cannot cough, cry, or make any sounds or at all, you should immediately check if he is breathing. Danger signs for choking also include your baby having only a weak and ineffective cough, or only making soft high-pitched sounds when he breathes in. Look to see if the baby is turning blue, losing consciousness, or is waving his arms desperately without making any sound; quickly check his chest to see if it's moving up and down, and listen for breathing sounds.If you can see the obstruction in the baby's mouth or throat and it is easily accessible you can remove it, but do not feel around in the baby's throat. You risk pushing the obstruction in further.You should not try to grab and pull out the obstruction if the baby is conscious.If the baby is unconscious, remove any visible objects from the mouth and begin CPR until the ambulance arrives. Be aware that there may be resistance to inflation initially until the stuck object is removed.

, If a baby is choking you should call emergency services before you begin to administer first aid. If possible, ask someone else to make the call, as you start to clear the baby's blocked airway. If you are alone, shout for help but don't leave the baby and be sure to continue to administer first aid. If your baby has been choking, you should always call your doctor afterwards. Do this even if the obstruction has been removed and she appears to be breathing normally., If your baby is struggling to breathe, or has stopped breathing you need to act quickly to dislodge the object which is obstructing his airway. The first technique to use is back blows. Turn the baby face down on your lap for the back blows. Hold the baby in this secure face-down position and be sure to support the baby's head. The front of the baby is supposed to be firmly leaning against your arm, and you can use your thigh for support.Ensure that you are not covering the baby's mouth or twisting his neck.
The baby's head should be slightly lower than her chest., Once you have positioned the baby you need to administer five firm but gentle back blows. Slap the baby's back, between her shoulder blades, with the heel of your hand five times. After five slaps, stop and check the baby's mouth to see if the blockage has become dislodged. If there is an obvious blockage which you can see and reach, carefully take it out. Do not do this if you risk pushing it further in.If, after administering five back blows, the baby's airway has not been cleared, you will need to perform five chest thrusts.

, If your baby is coughing and crying, then it's a good sign, because this means some air is coming through. If the baby is not crying after the previous step and the object has not been visibly coughed up, then the back blows were unsuccessful. In this case, it's time to perform chest thrusts. Place the baby facing upwards across your lap, with the head lower than the body. Use your thigh or lap for support and be sure to support the head., Once the baby is positioned and supported on your lap you need to perform five chest thrusts. Place two fingers on the centre of his breastbone, just below the nipples, or about one finger's breadth below the nipples. Then give five quick thrusts down.The force you exert should compress the chest between a third and a half of its depth.Check if the blockage has been dislodged and if it is easy for you to take it out do so, but again, do not risk pushing it in further.
Continue to perform back blows and chest thrusts in this cycle until the blockage has been removed or until help arrives.If the object has not been dislodged after three cycles of back blows and chest thrusts be sure to call emergency services immediately, if you haven't already., Even after the object has been dislodged you should pay close attention to your baby. It is possible that some of the substance which caused the blockage may remain and cause problems in the near future. If she has any trouble swallowing, or has a persistent cough, you should seek medical help immediately. Take your child to see your doctor or to your local Hospital, or Emergency Room."

Write down any details.",How to Help Someone Who Is Having a Seizure," When someone has a seizure, they can fall and injure themselves. To help them not get hurt, find a way to keep them from falling if they are standing. One way to help with this is to put your arms around them or catch their arms to hold them upright. Protect their head if you can.You may also try to guide them carefully to the floor if they still have some control of their movements.;
, If the person is lying down when you find them, try to get them onto their side with their mouth angled towards the floor. This helps protect them by letting the saliva and vomit out of the side of their mouth instead of having it slide back into their throat or windpipe, which could cause them to inhale it.Leaving a seizing person on their back can lead to choking and breathing fluids into their lungs.

, People who have seizures may injure themselves by hitting furniture, walls, or other nearby objects. To help the person avoid injury, move all objects around them as far away as possible. It is especially important to move any sharp objects from around the person.Moving the objects is easier than moving the person. However, if the person is walking around confused, try to steer them away from dangerous places, like traffic, high areas, or sharp objects.

, Some seizures may cause the person to hit their head against the floor repeatedly. If their head is striking the floor or an object, protect their head with something soft, like a pillow, cushion, or jacket.Do not restrain their head or any other part of their body.

, If someone near you has a seizure, you should try to time the length of the seizure. Seizures generally last between 60 to 120 seconds (one to two minutes). Seizures that last longer than that can indicate a bigger problem, and you should call emergency services.Use a watch if you have one for a more accurate time. However, you can count in your head how long the seizure lasts.

, Never place anything in a seizing person’s mouth, even if you think it will help prevent them from hurting their mouth or teeth. People who are seizing will not swallow their tongue. Putting things in their mouth may cause the seizing person to break a tooth. You should never place your fingers in their mouth. The person could bite your finger and injure you.

, During the seizure, never hold the person down. Never try to restrain them or keep them from moving. This will cause them injury. The person could dislocate their shoulder or break a bone., Some people who have seizures may wear medical identification jewelry. Look on the person's wrist for a bracelet, or around their neck for a necklace. Medical ID jewelry may give you information needed during an emergency.When you have a chance, you can look in their wallet or pockets for any medical ID card.

, Most seizures only last for a few minutes and are no reason to panic. You should stay calm to help the person who is seizing. If you panic or act stressed, the person seizing may also become stressed. Instead, remain calm and talk reassuringly to the person.You should also remain calm after the seizure. Staying calm and helping the person remain calm can help with their recovery.

, If you know that someone has a history of seizures, then you do not need to call emergency services unless the seizure lasts for more than 2-5 minutes or if there is something different about this seizure.However, if a person is having a seizure for the first time or if you are unsure, you should call an ambulance immediately.If you don't know the person, check for a medical bracelet to see if they regularly have seizures.
The person needs to be checked out by a medical professional to determine the underlying reason for the seizure.

, Most people's seizures are over after a few minutes, and then they regain consciousness and become aware of their surroundings. However, if a person has atypical seizure activity, you need to call an ambulance. Abnormal activity may include:Multiple seizures without regaining consciousness
The seizure lasting for more than five minutes
Inability to breathe
A seizure after the person complains of a sudden, severe headache
A seizure following a head injury
A seizure after inhaling fumes or poison
If it occurs with other signs of stroke, such as trouble speaking or understanding speech, loss of vision, and inability to move part or all of one side of the body

, Seizing when someone is in a dangerous situation can lead to injury or death. You should call emergency services if the person having the seizure is pregnant or has diabetes, is having the seizure in water, or has injured themselves during the seizure., After the seizure is over, wait until the person is calm. Then, you should turn the person onto their side if they are not in that position already. Look over the person’s body to check for any injuries that may have occurred during the seizure., If you notice the person is having trouble breathing after they have calmed, use your finger to clear the mouth. The person’s mouth may be full of saliva or vomit which may be blocking the airflow.If clearing the mouth doesn’t help them breathe better, call emergency services.

, If the person has a seizure in a public place, people may hang around to watch. Once you get the person to a safe place, ask the onlookers to move along and to give the person space and privacy.Coming out of a seizure surrounded by strangers who are staring can be very stressful for someone.

, Give the person a safe area where they can rest. Make sure any tight clothing around their neck and waist is loosened. Don’t let them eat or drink until they are calm, conscious, and cognizant of what is going on around them.Stay with the person while they rest and recover. Never leave a confused, unconscious, or sleepy person after a seizure.

, Just like you timed the seizure, you should also time their recovery. Evaluate how long it takes for the person to recover from the seizure and return to their normal state and activity level.If they take longer than 15 minutes to recover, call emergency services., Seizures can be frightening and stressful situations. Remember that a person may be confused or embarrassed when they wake up. Remind the person they are safe. When they are conscious and alert, explain what happened to them.Offer to remain with the person until they are feeling better.

, As soon as you get the chance, make a note of the details surrounding the seizure. This can be extremely valuable to the person who had the seizure, as well as to their doctor. Write down any of the following information:Part of the body the seizure started in
Parts of the body affected
Warning signs before the seizure
Length of the seizure
What the person was doing before and after the seizure
Any changes in mood
Any triggers, like tiredness, hunger, or feeling queasy
Any unusual sensations
Anything you noticed about the seizure, like a noise, if their eyes rolled, or if they fell and which way
The person's consciousness during and after the seizure
Any unusual behaviors during the seizure, like mumbling or touching their clothing
Any changes in their breathing

"
"
Assess the situation.,
Ask the person, ""Are you choking?,
Administer first-aid.,
Give back blows.,
Administer abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver).,
Modify the Heimlich maneuver for pregnant women and people who are obese.,
Make sure the object is completely gone.,
Check to see if normal breathing has returned.,
Administer help if the person falls unconscious.,
Consult a physician.",How to Help a Choking Victim1," Make sure the person is choking and determine whether it is a partial or total airway obstruction. If a person is experiencing mild choking, or partial airway obstruction, you are better off letting him cough to remove the obstruction himself.


Signs of partial airway obstruction include the ability to speak, cry out, cough or respond to you. The person will also usually be able to breathe, though it may be slightly labored and the person may grow pale in the face.In contrast, someone experiencing a total obstruction of the airway will not be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. In addition, you may notice the person making the ""choking sign"" (both hands clutched to the throat) and his lips and fingernails may turn blue due to lack of oxygen.;
,"".If the person can respond to you verbally, wait. Someone who is really choking will not be able to speak at all, but they may shake their head yes or no. It is important that you do not use back blows on a person who has partial airway obstruction because there is the risk of lodging the previously semi-loose object more deeply and potentially causing a total obstruction. If the person responds:


Reassure the person. Let him know that you are there and ready to help if need be.
Encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage. Do not use back blows.
Keep monitoring the situation and be prepared to help in the case that the person's airway becomes fully blocked or the choking becomes severe.

, If the person is choking severely or suffering from a total airway obstruction and is conscious, communicate your intent to perform first aid. It's a good idea to make sure that someone who is conscious know what you plan to do; this will also give him an opportunity let you know if your assistance is welcomed.


If you are the only person present who can help the person, perform the first aid described below before calling emergency services. If someone else is available, get him to call for assistance., Note that the following instructions apply to a person sitting or standing.


Stand behind the person and slightly off to one side. If you’re right-handed, stand to the left and if you’re left-handed, stand to the right.Support the person's chest with one hand and lean the person forward so that the object blocking his airway will exit his mouth (as opposed to going further down the throat).Administer up to 5 forceful blows between the person’s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (between your palm and wrist). Pause after each blow to see if the blockage has cleared. If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts (see below)., The Heimlich maneuver is an emergency technique that is only to be used on adults or children older than 1 year of age. Do not use the Heimlich maneuver on children under 1 year old.Stand behind the choking victim.
Put your arms around his waist and lean him forward.Make a fist with your hand and place it directly above the person's navel (belly button) but below the breastbone.Put your other hand on top of your first, then thrust both hands backwards into their stomach with a hard, upward movement.Do this thrusting action up to five times. Check after each thrust to see if the blockage is gone. Stop if the victim loses consciousness., Place your hands higher than described above in the regular Heimlich maneuver technique. Your hands should be at the base of the breast bone, just above where the lowest ribs join. Press hard into the chest with quick thrusts as described above. However, you will not be able to make the same upward thrusts. Repeat until the person stops choking and the blockage is dislodged or he falls unconscious., Once the airway is cleared, parts of the object that caused the person to choke can remain behind. If the person is able, ask the victim to spit it out and breathe without difficulty.


Look to see if there is something blocking the airway. If there is, you can also do a sweep through the person's mouth with your finger. Only sweep if you see an object, otherwise you could push it further back.

, Once the object is gone, most people will return to breathing normally. If normal breathing has not returned or if the person loses consciousness, move to the next step.

, If a choking person falls unconscious, lower him on his back onto the floor. Then, clear the airway if possible. If you can see the blockage, take your finger and sweep it out of the throat and out through the mouth. Don't do a finger sweep if you don't see an object. Be careful not to inadvertently push the obstruction deeper into the airway.If the object remains lodged and the person does not regain consciousness or respond, check whether the victim is breathing. Place your cheek close to the person's mouth. For 10 seconds: Look to see if the chest is rising and falling, listen for breathing, and feel for the person's breath against your cheek.If the person is not breathing, start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The chest compressions used in CPR may also dislodge the object.Send someone to dial emergency services or, if you are alone, call emergency services yourself and then return to help the person. Alternate between chest compressions, checking the airway, and performing rescue breathing while you wait for help to arrive.Give 2 breaths after every 30 chest compressions.Remember to recheck the mouth repeatedly while administering CPR.
There may be some resistance to chest inflation until the object is dislodged.

, If after choking, the person experiences a persistent cough, any difficulty breathing or a feeling that something is still stuck in his throat, he should see a medical professional immediately.Abdominal thrusts can also cause internal injuries and bruising. If you used this tactic or performed CPR on another person, he should be checked out by a physician afterwards."
"
Call emergency services.,
Perform the Heimlich maneuver on yourself.,
Consult a physician.",How to Help a Choking Victim2," If you're alone and choking, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Even if you can't speak, most emergency services still send someone to check out all calls., You may not be able to do this as forcefully as someone else, but you can still try to dislodge the item.Make a fist. Place it on your abdomen just above your navel.
Hold that fist with your other hand.
Bend over a chair, table, counter or other solid object.
Drive your fist in and up as described above.
Repeat until the object is removed or until assistance arrives.
Make sure the object is completely gone. Try to spit out the object and any of its remnants.

, If you experience a persistent cough, any difficulty breathing or a feeling that something is still stuck in your throat, see a medical professional immediately.Abdominal thrusts can also cause serious injuries. If you have used this tactic on yourself, you should be examined by a physician afterwards."
"
Check the scene for immediate danger.,
Assess the victim's consciousness.,
Send for help.,
Do not check for a pulse.,
Check for breathing.,
Place the victim on his or her back.,
Place the heel of one hand on the victim's breastbone, 2 finger-widths above the meeting area of the lower ribs, exactly between the normal position of the nipples.

,
Place your second hand on top of the first hand, palms-down, interlock the fingers of the second hand between the first.

,
Position your body directly over your hands, so that your arms are straight and somewhat rigid.,
Perform 30 chest compressions.,
Minimize pauses in chest compression that occur when changing providers or preparing for a shock.Attempt to limit interruptions to less than 10 seconds.

,
Make sure the airway is open.,
Give two rescue breaths (optional).,
Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions.,
Continue CPR until someone takes over for you, emergency personnel arrive, you are too exhausted to continue, an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available for immediate use, or signs of life return.

,
Use an AED (automated external defibrillator).,
Turn on the AED.,
Fully expose the victim's chest.,
Attach the sticky pads with electrodes to the victim's chest.,
Press analyze on the AED machine.,
Do not remove pads from the victim and resume CPR for another 5 cycles before using the AED again.,
Position the patient ONLY after the victim has been stabilized and is breathing on his/her own.

,
Flex and raise one knee joint, push the victim`s hand that's on the opposite side from the raised knee, partially under the hip with the straight leg.,
Use the recovery position to help the victim to breathe more easily.",How to Do CPR on an Adult," Make sure you're not putting yourself in harm's way by administering CPR to someone unconscious. Is there a fire? Is the person lying on a roadway? Do whatever is necessary to move yourself and the other person to safety.


If there is anything that could endanger you or the victim, see whether there is something you can do to counteract it. Open a window, turn off the stove, or put out the fire, if possible.
However, if there is nothing you can do to counteract the danger, move the victim. The best way to move the victim is by placing a blanket or coat underneath their back and dragging it.;
, Gently tap his or her shoulder and ask ""Are you OK?"" in a loud, clear voice. If he or she responds agreement ""Yeah"" or such, CPR is not required. Instead, undertake basic first aid and take measures to prevent or treat shock, and assess whether you need to contact emergency services.


If the victim does not respond, continue with the following steps.

, The more people available for this step, the better. However, it can be done alone. Send someone to call for emergency medical services (EMS).


To contact emergency services, call
• 911 in North America
• 000 in Australia
• 112 by cell phone in the EU (including the UK)
• 999 in the UK and Hong Kong.
• 102 in India
•1122 in Pakistan
• 111 in New Zealand
•123 in Egypt
•120 in China
Give the dispatcher your location, and notify him or her that you're going to perform CPR. If you're alone, put your phone on speaker mode so your hands are free to start compressions. If you have someone else with you, have him or her stay on the line while you do CPR on the victim.

, Unless you're a trained medical professional, odds are you'll spend too much valuable time looking for a pulse when you should be doing compressions.

, And, make sure that the airway is not blocked. If the mouth is closed, press with your thumb and forefinger on both cheeks at the back of the teeth to help open the mouth and then look inside. Remove any visible obstacle that is in your reach but never push your fingers too far inside. Put your ear close to the victim's nose and mouth, and listen for slight breathing. Watch for rising and falling of the chest.If the victim is coughing or breathing normally, do not perform CPR.

, Make sure he or she is lying as flat as possible - this is to prevent injury while you're doing chest compressions.Tilt their head back by using your palm against their forehead and a push against their chin.

,,, Don't flex the arms to push, but nearly lock your elbows, and use your upper body strength to push.

, Press down with both hands directly over the breastbone to perform a compression, which helps the heart beat. Chest compressions are more critical for correcting abnormal heart rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, heart rapidly quivering instead of beating).


You should press down by about 2 inches (5 cm).
Do the compressions in a relatively fast rhythm. Some agencies recommend doing compressions to the beat of the chorus of ""Stayin' Alive,"" a 1970s disco hit, or at roughly 100 beats per minute.

,, Place your hand on the victim's forehead and two fingers on their chin and tilt the head back to open the airway.


If you suspect a neck injury, pull the jaw forward rather than lifting the chin. If jaw thrust fails to open the airway, do a careful head tilt and chin lift.
If there are no signs of life, place a breathing barrier (if available) over the victim's mouth.

, The American Heart Association no longer considers rescue breaths necessary for CPR, as the chest compressions are more important. If you are trained in CPR and totally confident, give two rescue breaths after your 30 chest compressions. If you've never done CPR before, or you're trained but rusty, stick with only chest compressions.Keeping the airway open, take the fingers that were on the forehead and pinch the victim's nose closed. Make a seal with your mouth over the victim's mouth and breathe out for about one second. Make sure you breathe slowly, as this will make sure the air goes in the lungs and not the stomach.
If the breath goes in, you should see the chest slightly rise and also feel it go in. Give a second rescue breath.
If the breath does not go in, re-position the head and try again. If it does not go in again, the victim may be choking. Do abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich maneuver) to remove the obstruction.

, If you're also doing rescue breaths, keep doing a cycle of 30 chest compressions, and then 2 rescue breaths; repeat the 30 compressions and 2 more breaths.


You should do CPR for 2 minutes (5 cycles of compressions to breaths) before spend time checking for signs of life.

,, If an AED is available in the immediate area, use it as soon as possible to jump-start the victim's heart. Make sure there are no puddles or standing water in the immediate area.

, It should have voice prompts that tell you what to do.

, Remove any metal necklaces or underwire bras. Check for any body piercings, or evidence that the victim has a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (should be indicated by a medical bracelet) to avoid shocking too close to those spots ().


Make sure the chest is absolutely dry and the victim is not in a puddle. Note that, if the person has a lot of chest hair, you may need to shave it, if possible. Some AED kits come with razors for this purpose.

, Follow the instructions on the AED for placement. Move the pads at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from any metal piercings or implanted devices.


Make sure no one is touching the person, when you apply the shock.

, If a shock is needed for the patient, the machine will notify you. If you do shock the victim, make sure no one is touching him or her.

, Stick on adhesive electrode pads are intended to be left in place.

,, Then position the free hand onto the opposite shoulder, and roll the victim onto the side with the straight leg. The raised knee/bent leg is on top and helps stop the body from rolling over onto the abdomen. The arm with the hand tucked under the edge of the hip is kept from sticking out in the way when rolling the patient onto that side.

, This position keeps saliva (spit) from accumulating in the back of the mouth or throat, and helps the tongue to hang to the side without it falling/flopping into the back of the mouth and obstructing the airway.

Check the wound.,
Wash your hands before treating the wound.You do not want to cause an infection when treating your skinned knee, so wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before starting to take care of it.,
Stop any bleeding.,
Rinse the wound.,
Wash the wound.,
Remove any debris.,
Gently pat dry.,
Apply an antibiotic cream, especially if the wound was dirty.,
Cover the wound.,
Apply fresh bandages as needed.,
Reapply antibiotic cream daily.While this alone doesn’t make the wound heal faster, it will stave off infection.,
Pay attention to how the healing is progressing.,
Contact a doctor if things seem to get worse.",How to Heal a Skinned Knee," Most of the time, a skinned knee is a relatively minor problem, treatable at home—but inspect your wound just to be sure. A wound is considered minor and treatable without medical attention if:It is not deep enough to see fat, muscle, or bone.
It is not spurting blood.
Its edges are not jagged and far apart.
If you do notice any of these conditions, contact a doctor.
If the scrape was caused by rusty metal and you have not had a tetanus shot in several years, you should contact a doctor.;
, If you want extra protection, you can also put on disposable gloves before starting to clean the skinned knee.

, If there is any bleeding on your skinned knee, stop it by applying pressure on the site.


If dirt or debris is blocking the spot where the knee is bleeding, rinse it off before trying to stop the bleeding. Otherwise, rinse and wash the wound area after stopping the bleeding.
To stop the bleeding, hold a clean cloth or gauze over the bleeding portion of the wound, and apply pressure for a few minutes.
Change the cloth or gauze if it becomes soaked with blood.
If the bleeding does not stop after 10 minutes, contact a doctor, as stitches may be required., Let cool water run over your skinned knee, or pour it over it. Do this long enough to make sure that the water has flowed over the entire area, and washed away any loose dirt and/or debris., Use antibacterial soap and water to clean around the wound, but try not to get soap in the wound itself, as this can cause irritation.This will help to wash away bacteria and keep away infection.


Hydrogen peroxide and iodine were traditionally used to disinfect skin wounds, such as a skinned knee.However, hydrogen peroxide and iodine can actually damage living cells, so medical professionals now advise that you should not apply them to a wound., If anything is stuck in the wound, like dirt, sand, splinters, etc., use tweezers to carefully remove this material. First clean and sterilize the tweezers by rubbing them with a cotton ball or gauze soaked in isopropyl alcohol.Rinse with cool water once the debris is removed.


If dirt or other material is lodged so deep in the wound that you cannot get it out, contact a doctor., Once you have rinsed and washed the skinned knee, gently use a clean cloth or towel to dry the area. Patting rather than rubbing it dry will help you avoid unnecessary pain.

, This can deter infection and help the wound as it heals.There are numerous types of antibiotic creams and ointments, containing different active ingredients or combinations (bacitracin, neomycin, and polymyxin, for example).Always carefully follow the directions provided with your cream regarding the amount to use and method of application.
Some creams have mild analgesics incorporated as pain relief.
Some ointments and creams may cause an allergic reaction in some people. If you notice redness, itching, swelling, etc. after using one of these products, stop using it and try another one with a different active ingredient.

, Make sure to cover your skinned knee with a bandage, to protect it from dirt, infection, and irritation from clothing during the time it needs to heal. You can use an adhesive bandage, or sterile gauze held in place with tape or an elastic band., Change the bandage covering your skinned knee daily, or more frequently if it becomes wet or dirty.Wash any dirt away from the area, as before.


Research demonstrates that removing an adhesive bandage quickly rather than slowly will probably cause less pain, although it depends somewhat on the nature of the wound.Rubbing the ends of an adhesive bandage with oil, and letting it sit for a few moments, might help remove the bandage with less pain.

, An antibiotic cream will also keep a wound moist as it heals, which will prevent the scabbing and scarring that may result if a wound dries out. Generally, creams can be applied once or twice a day. check with product directions for frequency., Exactly how fast your skinned knee will heal depends on a number of factors like your age, nutrition, whether or not you smoke, your stress level, if you have an illness, etc. Moreover, antibiotic creams will only stave off infections, not actually heal the wound faster. If you wound seems to be healing abnormally slowly, check with a medical professional, as it could be a sign of something more serious, like an illness., You will need expert attention: If the knee joint stops working.
If your knee feels numb.
If the wound bleeds and won’t stop.
If there is dirt or other foreign material in the wound that you can’t get out of it.
If the wound site becomes inflamed or swollen.
If red streaks radiate from the wound.
If the wound site drains pus.
If you run a fever of over 100.4° F (38° C)

Simply pull them out into a clean container to melt and drink., Turn off the supply of water to your house if you know or think the lines may be contaminated between the main water supply and your house. Find the main valve. Generally, it is near your meter, which may be outside or in a basement or utility closet.You may need a special key to turn it off.Drain the water in your pipes. Turn on the highest faucet in your house to let air in. Next, put a container underneath the lowest faucet. Turn it on to drain out the water., Your hot water tank also contains clean drinking water. You need to turn off the electricity or gas to it first, as well as turning off the water supply by turning a valve. Once you've done that, you can drain off the water.Place a container under the drain at the bottom. Place another container under a faucet in the house. Turn on the hot water on that faucet to help start the draining. Let it drain until you've collected all the water.Disinfect the water with the steps included in this article., Your toilets can also be a source of water. Just make sure you only use the water in the top tank, not in the actual bowl. You'll also need to disinfect this water.Don't use toilet water if it has been treated with chemicals or if it is obviously discolored., Your canned goods can actually be a source of water if you are running out. Don't drain off the liquid from vegetables or fruit when you eat them. Instead, drink the water to help hydrate yourself., For instance, you may be tempted to use water from your water bed. However, these types of bed often have additives to prevent growth. Nonetheless, you can collect this water for washing up., Lakes, creeks, and ponds can all be used for drinking water, as long as they are freshwater. Of course, you need to sanitize the water first. Look for running water near your house where you can collect water in jugs. Just be sure to keep your water-collecting jugs separate from your sanitized jugs for storing water.Skip saltwater, as it will just dehydrate you.

, You can also use old rainwater or collect rainwater for drinking purposes. To collect rainwater, place open containers outside during a rainstorm to catch water. This water will also need to be sanitized.You can also melt snow and use it in a similar manner, sanitizing it first., If you have wells or springs nearby that haven't been tested, you can use them in case of emergency. Because this water is untested, sanitize it before you drink it., If possible, use your radio or phone to find out where help is being provided in your community. During most disasters, the government and other aid organizations will have areas set up that will provide food and water to those in need. You can also find shelters if your home has been destroyed., If the water isn't clear, you need to filter it first. You can use a clean piece of cloth. You can also use a coffee filter or paper towels. If none of these are available, allow the water to sit until you see clear water at the top. Spoon or draw off the clear water, being careful not to disturb the sediment at the bottom. If the water is already clear, you don't need to take this step.One way to draw off water is to use a clean towel. Roll it tightly into a rope-like tube. Place one end in the drinking water and the other end in a container to hold the water. The end in the new container should be several inches below the end in the water. The water will wet the towel, then drip off the end., Though you've found a source of water, it may not be safe to drink. Even if you have access to tap water, it could be contaminated if pipes are broken or flooded.Boil the water for a full minute. Once the water reaches a rolling boil, make sure it boils for a full minute or for 3 minutes above 6,500 feet.Store in sanitized containers., If you can't boil water, you can disinfect the water with chemicals. Add chlorine bleach (5-6%) to water at a ratio of 1/8 teaspoon per gallon if your water is clear. If it's not, you need to double the amount to 1/4 teaspoon per gallon. Make sure to incorporate the bleach thoroughly. Let it sit for 1/2 an hour before drinking.Once disinfected, the water should be kept in clean, sanitized containers.

, Plan on a gallon a day for everyone in the household. You should include your pets in this calculation. Store at least 3 days worth of water, though 2 weeks is better if you have the space.For instance, if you have 3 people and 1 dog in your household, that's 4 gallons a day. For a 3-day supply, that's 12 gallons of water. For a 2-week supply, that's 56 gallons.

, Water that has been commercially bottled is the safest to store.It is less likely to be contaminated with bacteria, and it will keep for longer.If you prefer to store your own water, use 2-liter soda bottles, as milk and juice can leave behind a residue that can grow bacteria.Use soap and water to clear the jug of any residue. Make sure all the soap is out of it. Add a teaspoon of bleach to a quart of water. Use that solution to sanitize the bottles. Pour it in. Put the lid on the container, and shake it thoroughly. Wait half a minute or more to pour it out.Let the bottle air dry. Only rinse if you have clean (sanitized) water already available.Add tap water. Once you have cleaned the bottles and let them dry, you can add tap water. As long as your city adds chlorine to the water, that is all you need to do. If you are on an alternative source for water, you need to add bleach yourself. Use unscented bleach at a ratio of 2 drops for each gallon of water.Screw the lids on tightly when you're done, then label it as drinking water.

, Put the water in a cool area. The area doesn't need to be completely dark, but it shouldn't be in sunlight. Also, make sure to not store the bottles near pesticides, gasoline, or other chemicals., Check the expiration dates on commercially bottled water to figure out when you need to replace it. For water you bottle at home, replace it every 6 months."

Allow the baby to cough.,
Look for symptoms of choking.,
Do not attempt to remove the obstruction by hand.,
Call local emergency services, if possible.",How to Do First Aid on a Choking Baby1," If the baby is coughing or gagging, this means that their airway is only partially blocked, so they are not being completely deprived of oxygen. If this is the case, allow the baby to continue coughing, as coughing is the most effective way to clear any obstructions.If your baby is making choking noises and they are old enough to understand you, try instructing them to cough or demonstrate how to do it before administering first aid.;
, If the baby is unable to cry or make noise, their airway is completely blocked and they will be unable to remove the obstruction by coughing. Other symptoms that indicate choking include:


Producing an odd, high-pitched sound or an inability to make any sound at all.
Clutching at the throat.
Skin turning bright red or blue.
Lips and fingernails turning blue.
Unconsciousness.

, Whatever you do, do not attempt to remove the obstruction yourself by sticking your hand down the baby's throat. This may cause the object the become lodged more deeply, or damage the baby's throat., Once you have ascertained that the baby is choking, your next step is to perform emergency first aid. If the baby is deprived of oxygen for too long they will lose consciousness and may suffer brain damage or even death. In such an emergency situation, it is important to have trained healthcare professionals on the scene as quickly as possible:If possible, have another person call local emergency services immediately, while you administer first aid. For your local number, check How to Call Emergency Services.If you are alone with the baby, start administering first aid immediately. Do this for two minutes, then stop and call emergency services. Resume care until the health care professionals arrive.Note that if the baby suffers from any heart conditions or you suspect that they are experiencing an allergic reaction (where the throat closes up), you should call emergency services immediately, even if you are alone."

Make sure that there's no possibility of spinal injury before moving the victim.,
Roll the victim onto their stomach if they're on their back.",How to Do a Fireman's Carry1," If a traumatic accident has taken place and you think the victim has injured their spine, then do not move them unless it's absolutely necessary to evade an urgent danger, such as a flood.


If you absolutely do need to move a victim that might have injured their spine, then you'll need to drag them instead of carrying them over your shoulder to minimize the chances of spinal damage.;
, If the victim is on their back, roll them over on their stomach so they'll be easier to lift. To do this, just place one arm on the victim's shoulder and one arm on the same side of their body and push or pull them on to their stomach.


If there is time and the person is not breathing, you may need to perform CPR.

Position the baby correctly.,
Perform five back blows.,
Reposition the baby.,
Perform five chest thrusts.,
Repeat until the obstruction is dislodged.,
If the baby loses consciousness, perform modified CPR.",How to Do First Aid on a Choking Baby2," When administering first aid to a baby younger than a year, it is important that you support the head and neck at all times. To get the baby in a safe, professionally-recommended position for administering first aid, do the following:


Slide one arm under the baby's back so that your hand is cradling their head and their back is resting against your forearm.

Place your other arm firmly along the baby's front, so there is sandwiched between your forearms. Use your top hand to securely grasp the baby's jaw between your thumb and fingers, without covering their airways.Gently flip the baby onto their front, so they are now resting on the opposite forearm. Keep their head supported by the jaw.Rest your arm against your thigh for added support and ensure that the baby's head is lower than the rest of her body. You are now in the correct position to perform back blows., Back blows create pressure and vibration in the baby's airway, which is often enough to dislodge any stuck objects.To perform a back blow on a baby less than twelve months old:


Use the heel of your hand to firmly hit the baby on the back, between the shoulder blades. Ensure that you are adequately supporting the head as you do this.Repeat this movement up to five times. If this does not dislodge the object, move on to performing chest thrusts., Before you can perform a chest thrust, you will need to turn the baby over. To do this:


Place your free arm (which you were previously using to perform the back blows) along the baby's back and cradle the back of her head in your hand.
Gently turn them over, keeping your other hand and arm firmly pressed against their front.Lower the arm supporting the baby's back, so that it's resting against your thigh. Again, ensure that the baby's head is lower than the rest of her body., Chest thrusts force the air out of the baby's lungs, which may be enough to dislodge the object.To perform a chest thrust on a baby less that a year old:


Place two or three fingertips in the center of the baby's chest, just below their nipples.Push inwards and upwards, applying enough pressure to compress the baby's chest about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm). Allow the baby's chest to return to its normal position before repeating up to five times.When compressing the baby's chest, ensure that the movements are firm and controlled, rather than jerky. Your fingers should be in contact with the baby's chest at all times., Alternate between giving the baby five back blows and five chest compressions until the object becomes dislodged, the baby starts crying or coughing, or the emergency services arrive., If the baby becomes unresponsive and emergency services have still not arrived, you will need to perform modified CPR on the baby. Be aware that modified CPR is different from normal CPR, as it is tailored to be performed on small babies."

Check the baby's mouth for an object.,
Open the baby's airway.,
Check if the baby is breathing.,
Give the baby two rescue breaths.,
Perform thirty chest compressions.,
Give another two rescue breaths followed by thirty chest compressions and repeat for as long as necessary.",How to Do First Aid on a Choking Baby3," Before you begin CPR, you should check the baby's mouth to see if the object they were choking on has become dislodged. Lie the baby on their back, on a firm, flat surface.


Use your hand to open the baby's mouth and look inside. If you see something, remove it using your baby finger.
Even if you can't see anything, proceed to the next step.

, You can do this by using one hand to tilt the baby's head back slightly and the other to lift their chin. Don't tilt their head back too far, it takes very little to open a small baby's airway., Before proceeding with CPR, you should check to ensure the baby is not breathing. You can do this by placing your cheek very close to the baby's mouth, looking towards their body.If they are breathing, you should be able to see their chest rising and falling slightly.
In addition, you may be able to hear breathing noises and feel their breath on your cheek.

, Once you have confirmed that the baby is not breathing, you can begin CPR. Begin by covering their mouth and nose with your own mouth and blow two small rescue breaths gently into their lungs.


Each breath should last for about a second and you should see the baby's chest rise as the air goes in. Pause between breaths to allow the air to escape.Remember that a baby's lungs are very small, so you shouldn't blow too much air or blow too forcefully.

, Once you have performed the rescue breaths, leave the baby lying on her back and use the same technique you used earlier for the chest thrusts - that is, using two or three fingers to firmly compress the baby's chest by about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm).Press straight down on the baby's breastbone, in the center of the baby's chest, slightly below the nipples.
The chest compressions should be performed at a rate of 100 compressions per minute. This means that you should be able to get through the thirty recommended compressions, in addition to the two rescue breaths, in approximately 24 seconds., Repeat this cycle of two rescue breaths, followed by thirty chest compressions, until the baby starts breathing again and regains consciousness or until emergency services arrive.Even if the baby starts breathing again, they will need to be examined by a healthcare professional to ensure that they have sustained no further injuries.

Administer five back blows.,
Administer five abdominal thrusts.,
Repeat until the obstruction clears or the child starts coughing.,
If the child becomes unresponsive, perform modified CPR.",How to Do First Aid on a Choking Baby4," To give first aid to a child older than twelve months, sit or stand behind them and place an arm diagonally across their chest. Lean the child forward slightly, so they are resting against your arm. With the heel of your free hand, administer five firm and distinct blows to the child's back, directly between the shoulder blades. If this does not dislodge the object, move on to abdominal thrusts., An abdominal thrust - also known as the Heimlich maneuver - works by forcing the air out of a person's lungs, in attempt to clear any obstructions from the airways. It is safe to perform on a child older than a year.To administer an abdominal thrust:


Stand or sit behind the choking child and wrap your arms around their waist.
Make a fist with one hand and place it firmly on the child's stomach, thumb side in, slightly above the belly button.Wrap your other hand around the fist and deliver a quick upward and inward thrust to the child's abdomen. This motion should force air and any lodged objects out of the windpipe.For smaller children, be careful not to thrust against the breastbone, as this could cause injury. Keep your hands just above the navel.Repeat up to five times.

, If the child is still choking after five back blows and five abdominal thrusts, repeat the entire procedure again and continue to do so until the object becomes dislodged, the child starts coughing, crying or breathing, or emergency services arrives., If the child still cannot breath and loses consciousness, you will need to perform modified CPR as quickly as possible.

Check the child's mouth for an object.,
Open the child's airway.,
Give two rescue breaths.,
Perform thirty chest compressions.,
Alternate between two rescue breaths and thirty chest compressions, for as long as necessary.",How to Do First Aid on a Choking Baby5," Before you begin CPR, open the child's mouth and look for any objects that may have become dislodged. If you see something, remove it with your fingers., Next, open the child's airway by tilting their head back and their chin upward slightly. Check for breathing by placing your cheek next to the child's mouth.If they are breathing, you should either see their chest rising and falling slightly, hear breathing noises or feel their breath against your cheek.
Do not proceed with CPR if the child is breathing on their own., Pinch the child's nose and cover her mouth with your own. Give two rescue breaths, each lasting about a second. Make sure to pause between each breath to allow the air to come back out.


If the rescue breaths are working, you should see the child's chest inflate as you exhale.If their chest does not inflate, their windpipe is still blocked and you should return to the first aid procedures to dislodge the obstruction.

, Begin chest compressions by placing the heel of one hand on the child's breastbone, right between the nipples. Place the heel of your other hand on top and interlock your fingers. Position your body directly above your hands and begin compressions:


Each compression should be hard and fast, and should compress the child's chest by about 2 inches (5.1 cm). Allow the chest to return to its normal position between each compression.Count each of the thirty compressions out loud, as this will help you keep track. They should be performed at a rate of 100 compressions per minute., Repeat the sequence of two rescue breaths followed by thirty chest compressions until the child starts breathing again or emergency services arrives."

Hook your elbows under the victim's armpits.,
Raise the victim to their feet.,
Place your right leg between the victim's legs.,
Grab the victim's right hand with your left.,
Squat down.,
Wrap your right arm around the back of the victim's right knee.,
Rise up and lift the victim's right thigh over your right shoulder.,
Move the victim.",How to Do a Fireman's Carry2," To do this, kneel by the victim's head and hook your elbows under their shoulders, therefore sticking your arms under the person's back and armpits. Your head should be facing the victim's feet and you should have your feet planted on the ground so you can stand easily., Lift slowly, using your legs to support the person's weight. Avoid using the strength of your back to lift them or you may injure yourself. Raise them until their feet are just a foot or so away from being straightened into standing position and are still dragging on the ground a bit.

, This will help you get a firmer grip on the victim. Just move your weight to your right or dominant leg and stick it between the victim's legs for support. If your dominant leg is your left leg, use your left leg instead and follow the opposite of all of the positioning in the instructions.

, You should begin to do this as you place your right leg between the victim's legs. If your dominant leg is your right leg, then you should grab the victim's right hand with your left hand; if not, do the opposite. After you do that, you should drape the hand over your shoulder so you have more leverage, with your head planted under the their armpit and side.

, Keep your back as straight as possible when you do this. Place the victim's body over above your shoulders, so that their torso is relatively perpendicular to the ground. Try to distribute their weight as evenly as you can over your shoulders so that they don't tilt to one side.

, To do this, put your right arm between the victim's legs to reach behind his right knee. This will help you get a firmer grasp on the victim. Your left hand should still be holding on to the victim's right hand. Gripping the victim with both hands on his knee and arm will help you lift them., Keep your back straight. The left leg and arm of the person should now be hanging behind and the body should be supported by your shoulders. Hold onto the victim's right arm and leg with your right and left hands, respectively, as you stand up. Alternately, you can use your right arm to wrap around the victim's thighs and grab their right hand.

, Now that you have the victim draped safely over your back, you should look forward and move cautiously, using your free arm for balance. To do this, you'll need to adjust your weight. Gently adjust the weight to distribute evenly among both shoulders; this will enable you to carry the person for longer distances, possibly 50 feet (15 m) or more. Try to keep the victim's torso level to prevent further injury.

Check the scene for danger.,
Check the victim for consciousness.,
Check the victim’s pulse.,
Understand the importance of reacting quickly.,
Perform CPR for two minutes.,
Remember CAB.,
Position your hands for the compressions.,
Perform 30 compressions.,
Make sure the airway is open.,
Give two rescue breaths.,
Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two breaths.,
Use an AED.",How to Do CPR on a Child," If you come across someone who is unconscious, you need to quickly make sure there are no dangers to yourself if you choose to help them. Is there a car exhaust running? A gas stove? Is there a fire? Are electrical lines down? If there is anything that could endanger you or the victim, see if there is something you can do to counteract it. Open a window, turn off the stove, or put out the fire if possible.


However, if there is nothing you can do to counteract the danger, move the victim. The best way to move the victim is by placing a blanket or a coat underneath her back and pulling on the coat or blanket.
If there is a chance the person has suffered a spinal injury two people should move her to prevent any twisting of the head and neck.;
, Shake or tap his shoulder and saying in a loud, clear voice, ""Are you okay? Are you okay?"" If he responds, he is conscious. He may have just been sleeping, or he could have been unconscious. If it still appears to be an emergency situation — for example, he is having trouble breathing or he appears to be fading in between consciousness and unconsciousness — call for help and begin basic first aid and take measures to prevent or treat shock.

, If the child is unresponsive, the first thing to do is check her pulse.If the child does not respond, you need to begin CPR immediately. Do not check the pulse for more than 10 seconds. If the victim does not have a pulse, her heart is not beating and you will be required to perform chest compressions.To check the neck (carotid) pulse, feel for a pulse on the side of the victim's neck closest to you by placing the tips of your first two fingers beside the Adam's apple. (Be aware that the Adam's apple is usually not visible on a female, and may not even be very visible on a boy who has not yet gone through puberty.)
To check the wrist (radial) pulse, place your first two fingers on the thumb side of the victim's wrist.
Other pulse locations are the groin and ankle. To check the groin (femoral) pulse, press the tips of two fingers into the middle of the groin. To check the ankle (posterior tibial) pulse, place your first two fingers on the inside of the ankle.

, If you see someone whose heart has stopped beating or has stopped breathing, reacting quickly and performing rescue breathing and CPR could save his life. When someone starts CPR before an ambulance arrives, the patient has a considerably better chance of surviving.Being able to respond quickly by performing CPR, which can help get oxygenated blood back flowing to the brain, is essential.

If the person has a pulse but is not breathing, only perform rescue breathing, not chest compressions.
A human brain can typically go for around four minutes without oxygen before suffering permanent brain damage.
If the brain goes without oxygen for between four and six minutes the chances of brain damage rise.
If the brain lacks oxygen for six to eight minutes brain damage is probable.
If the brain is without oxygen for over ten minutes, brain death is probable., Once you have quickly assessed the situation and checked the consciousness and circulation of the victim you need to act very quickly. If there is no pulse you must begin CPR immediately, and continue it for two minutes (which is about five cycles of CPR) and then call for Emergency Medical Services.If you are alone it is important to start CPR before calling for help.


If someone else is there send them for help. If you are alone, do not call until you have completed two minutes of CPR.Dial your local emergency number. Call 911 in North America, 000 in Australia, 111 in New Zealand, 112 by cell phone in the EU (including the UK) and 999 in the UK.
If possible, send someone else to get an AED (Automatic External Defibrillator) if there is one in the building or nearby.

, CAB is the basic process of CPR. It stands for Chest Compressions, Airway, Breathing. In 2010, the recommended sequence changed with chest compressions placed before airway opening and rescue breathing. Chest compressions are more critical for correcting abnormal heart rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia), and because one cycle of 30 chest compressions only requires 18 seconds, airway opening and rescue breathing are not significantly delayed.Chest compressions, or hands-only CPR is recommended if you have not been properly trained or are worried about performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a stranger., When performing CPR on a child the positioning of your hands is especially important, given that a child will be more fragile than an adult. Locate the child's sternum by moving two fingers to the bottom of the rib cage. Identify where the lower the ribs meet in the middle and then place the heel of your other hand on top of your fingers. Just use the heel of this hand to do the compressions., Compress the chest, with elbows locked, by pushing straight down about 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep. The smaller body of a child needs less pressure than an adult would. If you begin to hear or feel a cracking sound, that may indicate that you are pushing too hard. Continue, but apply less pressure with the compressions.Do 30 of these compressions, and do them at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute if you are the only rescuer.

Allow complete chest recoil after each compression.Minimize pauses in chest compression that occur when changing providers or preparing for a shock. Attempt to limit interruptions to less than 10 seconds.
If there are two rescuers, each should complete a round of 15 compressions.

, Place your hand on the victim's forehead and two fingers on his chin. Lift the chin gently with the two fingers while carefully pushing down on the forehead with your other hand. If you suspect a neck injury, gently pull the jaw upward rather than lifting the chin.Once you have done this you should look, listen and feel for breathing.


Put your ear close to the victim's mouth and nose and listen carefully for any signs of life.
Watch for chest movement and feel for any breath on your cheek.If there are no signs of life, place a breathing barrier (if available) over the victim's mouth.

, Keeping the airway open, take the fingers that were on the forehead and pinch the victim's nose closed. Make a seal with your mouth over the victim's mouth and breathe out for about one second. Make sure you breathe slowly, as this will make sure the air goes in the lungs not the stomach. Make sure you keep your eye on the victim's chest.


If the breath goes in, you should see the chest slightly rise and also feel it go in. If the breath goes in, give a second rescue breath.If the breath does not go in, reposition the head and try again.If it does not go in again, the victim may be choking. You'll need to do more chest compressions in this case. Keep in mind abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich manuever) should only be performed on someone who is conscious.

, You should do CPR for two minutes (five cycles of compressions to breaths) before checking for signs of life, a pulse or breathing. Continue CPR until someone takes over for you; emergency personnel arrive; you are too exhausted to continue; an AED is attached, charged, and the person running it asks you to clear the body; or pulse and breathing return.Don't forget to call the emergency services after the first two minutes of CPR.
After you call them, continue to administer CPR until they arrive.

, If an AED becomes available, turn on the AED, place the pads as instructed (one over the right chest and another over the left side). Allow the AED to analyse the rhythm, and give one shock if indicated, after clearing everyone from the patient (yell ""CLEAR!"" first). Resume chest compressions immediately after each shock for another 5 cycles before reassessing.If the victim begins breathing, gently manoeuvre them into the recovery position.

Gather your other supplies.These include a tourniquet (to help locate the vein you will insert the needle into), tape or medical adhesives (to keep all of the equipment in place once the needle is inserted), alcohol swabs (to sterilize the equipment), and labels (to keep track of the time of administration, the type of IV fluid, and the person who inserted the IV line).,

Clean the spot where you will insert the cannula.,
Insert the cannula.,
Connect the IV tubing to the cannula hub.,
Regulate the drops per minute.,
Monitor your patient for any signs of an adverse reaction.",How to Administer IV Fluids," The IV stand is the tall coat hanger-like device that you will hang the IV bag on when you are preparing and administering it. In case you can’t find an IV stand and it is an emergency, your will have to hook the bag up to a place that is above the patient’s head, so that the force of gravity helps the liquid to flow downward into the person's vein.;
, Turn the faucet on and lather your hands with soap and water. Start with your palms and work to the back of your hands. Make sure that you also clean the areas between your fingers. The next step is to focus on washing from your fingers to your wrists. Finally, rinse thoroughly and pat your hands dry.


If there is no water source, rub your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer., It is always important to check the doctor’s orders again before you begin. Giving a patient the wrong IV bag could lead to a life-threatening situation, such as an allergic reaction.


You should double check that you are giving the medication to the right patient, that you are doing it at the right date and time, that you are giving the correct medication in the correct order, and that the bag is the right volume.
If you have any questions at all, it is important that you ask the doctor before continuing so that you are 100% sure you understand what you are supposed to do.

, A set is the tube and connector that regulate how much fluid the patient will get. A macroset is used when you are supposed to give the patient 20 drops per minute, or about 100 mL per hour. Adults generally receive a macroset.A microset is used when you want to give the patient 60 drops of IV fluid per minute. Infants, toddlers, and younger children generally need a microset.
The size of the tubing (and the size of needle) that you use will also depend on the purpose for the IV. If it is an emergency situation where the patient needs fluids as quickly as possible, you will more likely choose a larger needle and tube in order to deliver the fluids and/or blood products or other medications as quickly as possible.
In less urgent situations, you may choose a smaller needle and tubing.

, The trick here is that the higher the needle gauge, the smaller the size of the needle. 14 is the largest and it is usually used to correct symptoms of shock and trauma. 18-20 is the usual kind of needle used by adult patients. 22 is usually used on pediatric patients (such as infants, toddlers, and young children) or geriatric patients with ., Always wear gloves for standard protection against blood and body fluid exposure.

, When the time comes to give the patient the IV, you will want to have all of your supplies right there. This will ensure that the procedure as quick and easy as possible.

, Look at the bag and locate the port of entry (this is located at the top of the IV bottle and is similar to a bottle cap). The port of entry is also where the macroset or microset line will be inserted. Unwrap an alcohol swab to sanitize the port of entry and the surrounding area of the bag.If you ever get confused while assembling the IV bag, there should be instructions written on the bag that you can follow. However, if you have any questions, stop what you're doing and find someone who knows what to do.

, Ensure that the drip chamber is in place (this is the part of the IV line that collects the fluid going through the patient’s vein). This is also the part where medical personnel are able to regulate the IV to make sure the patient gets the right medication.


IV pumps, or infusion pumps, are often used to help deliver a precise dose for the proper amount of time.

, Make sure that the drip chamber is half filled. Once it is half filled, let the fluid in the IV flow until it reaches the end of the line (this is to remove any air bubbles are are trapped in the line). Close it when it reaches the end by clamping the tube.


This is also termed as priming the tubing. This is an essential step, as inserting an air bubble into the patient could be fatal.

, The IV is sterile (as in it does not have any bad microorganisms on it). If the line touches the floor, the fluid in the IV could be compromised (meaning bad microorganisms could get into it and infect the patient).If the IV line does touch the floor, you will have to prepare a new IV, as the contaminated IV could potentially harm your patient. Keep the IV line close so that it does not touch the floor again.

, Be courteous, introduce yourself and tell him that you will be the one administering his IV fluids. It's best to lay all of the facts out for your patient — the needle puncturing his skin will hurt. Try to describe it so that he knows what he is getting into., Wash your hands again to ensure extra cleanliness before putting on your gloves — this can also help reassure the patient that you care about her health and protecting her against unnecessary exposure to bacteria.


Lying or sitting calms the patient down and actually reduces the amount of pain she will feel. It also ensures that she is in a stable position where she won't pass out if she has a psychological fear of needles.

, The cannula is the tube-like structure that you will insert at the same time as the needle, but it will stay in place after you take the needle out. You should look for a vein on the non-dominant arm (the one the person doesn't write with). You should look for a long, dark vein that you will easily be able to see when you are inserting the needle.Start by looking for veins lower down on the arm, or even on the back of the hand. Starting lower down will give you more ""chances"" if you are not successful at inserting the IV on your first try. If you need to try a second time, you will need to move higher up the arm, so there are benefits to trying lower down first if you can find a reasonably visible vein.
You can also look for veins that are located in the crease where the forearm meets the upper arm. These are often the easiest to insert an IV into; however, if the patient bends his arm, this can block the IV.

, When you tie the tourniquet, it will cause the vein to bulge, which will make it easier to see, and easier to insert the needle into.

, Use an alcohol swab to clean the insertion site (the spot that you will be putting the needle into). Use a circular motion when you clean the spot so that you get rid of as many microorganisms as possible. Let the area dry.Do not wave your hand over the area as if to dry it, as this can causes bacteria to be waved over the ""cleaned area"". Instead, allow the alcohol to air dry.

, Position the cannula so that you are holding it at a 30–45 degree angle to the patient’s arm and vein. Hold the cannula like you would hold a syringe so that you do not accidentally pass it through the vein. When you feel a “pop” and dark blood appears inside the cannula, decrease the angle of insertion so it is parallel to the patient’s skin.If this is your first time you are attempting this procedure, make sure you are doing so under supervision.


Push the cannula forward another 2mm. Then fix the needle and push the rest of the cannula in a little bit further.Remove the needle fully. Apply pressure above insertion site while maintaining site and connect tubing, otherwise the patient may bleed.
Dispose of the needle in a designated sharps container.
Finally, untie the tourniquet and clean the insertion site where the cannula is sticking out of the skin with a hypoallergenic dressing or alcohol swab.

, You should do this by slowly feeding the tubing into the cannula until you can connect it. Make sure that it is secure once it is connected. Slowly open the line so that the IV fluid goes into the tube and into the patient. You should also put tape on the tubing so that it stays in place on the patient’s arm.


Start by administering normal saline in order to ensure the IV is open and unobstructed.If you notice swelling in the surrounding tissue, or other problems with fluid administration, stop the saline flush and immediately remove the cannula. You will need to start the process over again.
Assuming that the saline flows normally through the IV access you have set up, you can proceed to administering what the doctor has specifically ordered through the IV.

, Regulate the IV drip rate according to the physician’s order. Usually in a clinic or hospital, the physician will order a specific rate, like milliliters per hour.

In a field setting, you will need to do this manually. The IV may have roller clamps and you need to count the drops per minute. Other IV sets already have a roller knob that you can turn and set the drops per minute so that you don’t have to count.







, Check your patient’s heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature. Report any untoward signs and symptoms. These symptoms could include an elevated heart rate, respiratory rate, difficulty breathing, hives, anaphylactic shock, or an increase in temperature and high blood pressure.

Make treatment of the bleeding wound a priority.,
Expose the entire wound to see the full extent of the injury.,
Apply a regular dressing over the wound.,
Check the limb for signs of ischemia after securing the bandage.,
Elevate the injured limb.,
Apply manual pressure to the wound.,
Apply the pressure dressing only if manual pressure and elevation fail.,
Make improvised bandages from strips of cloth.,
Secure a wad of the improvised bandages over the wound.,
Check the limb with the pressure dressing frequently.,
Treat bleeding wounds on the torso and the head differently.,
Apply a tourniquet to a limb as a last resort.",How to Apply a Pressure Bandage1," Time is of the essence when a deep wound is bleeding profusely. Call or send for help immediately, or come up with a plan to reach medical personnel if you are somewhere remote.Stabilize the injured person as much as possible before you consider leaving him if it is just the two of you. Delegate duties if several people are present. Let someone call or go for help if there is another who can help with the pressure dressing.If the person is conscious, ask for his consent to treat the wound before you touch it.;
, Cut, tear, push, and/or lift any clothing away from the wound. If clothing is stuck to the wound, leave that portion in place and work around it. Do not try to wash the wound. Resist the impulse to remove any impaled objects from the wound.If you have access to a sterile saline solution, you can add some of this to keep the wound moist and to lift away clothing gently.
Help the wound to coagulate. Ripping off the portion of clothing stuck to the wound may disturb blood clots and cause more bleeding.Do not remove objects because they may be having a tamponade or compression effect within the wound. Injured blood vessels, arteries, or veins can clot faster when any type of pressure is applied. Removing an object from the wound may lead to more rapid hemorrhage or blood loss.If an impaled object is involved, take a triangular bandage and roll it into a cord. Wrap this cord around the object to keep it from moving. Try not to jostle the object as you do this. You can also use rolled up gauze on either side of the object as well. Tape the support dressing in place. In a pinch, use clothing or other materials that are as clean as you can find. It is important that the impaled object move as little as possible, so that it does not cause tissue/blood vessel damage or initiate new bleeding.
Leave washing the wound to medical personnel. The gentlest cleansing could dislodge blood clots. Treat serious and deep wounds differently from everyday superficial wounds. Do not manipulate the wound more than necessary. It is okay to protect the wound from further contamination if the area around the victim is dirty or filled with chemicals., Find the cleanest cloth available if you do not have a first-aid kit. Stabilize any impaled objects sticking out the wound with some of the bandage/cloth before you cover the wound. Secure the dressing in place.If no impaled object is involved, make a dressing of sterile, nonstick gauze or the cleanest, most absorptive cloth available. Fold it into a dressing about 1 inch thick and apply it to wound.
Then, take a triangular bandage (or other length of cloth about 3 feet long). Fold it into a ribbon the width of your palm, then wrap it around the limb. Secure it with a firm but easily adjustable knot.
Do not place the knot on the wound, but to the outside of the limb.

, Make sure it has not turned blue or cool. This is a vital step if cloth has been tied around the limb. Loosen the bandage slightly if you see signs of inadequate oxygen delivery to the limb or if you cannot find the pulse. Check the pulse below the bandage. Check on the inside of the wrist near the thumb or on top of the foot near the ankle., The limb should be elevated above the level of the injured person’s heart. Do not elevate the limb before you splint any broken bones. Elevate the leg by placing the foot or ankle on a pack, log, rock, or any other object; this works if the injured person is lying down or sitting. Elevate the arm by placing the forearm on the chest if the injured person is lying on her back or by placing the wrist on top of the head if she is sitting.Splint a limb by finding straight objects (branches, foam, or cardboard) and wrapping material (clothing or climbing web). Use the wrapping material to first cover the objects that you will use as splints to avoid infection. Cut or rip sections so that you have at least three ties; use them to secure the objects on the limb to keep the fracture immobilized and to keep any injured joints straight. Do not compromise the blood flow to the limb by wrapping it too tightly.Do not apply these bandage ties on top of the wound or the break. Apply them above and below the injury site. Remember to check the hand/foot beneath the splint for adequate blood flow.

, Put direct pressure over the bandage with the hand. Maintain this for five to 10 minutes. Reassess for signs of uncontrolled hemorrhage like blood soaking the regular dressing or dripping from under the dressing., If direct pressure fails to stem bleeding and the wound still bleeds through a second layer of bandage, then it is time to apply a pressure bandage. Pressure bandages prevent prolonged and excessive blood loss, which can cause a drop in blood volume (a decrease in the amount of blood flowing in your vessels), decreased blood pressure, loss of consciousness, and death.Replace any blood volume losses and raise the victim’s blood pressure with liquids by mouth. Only do this if he is fully awake and the wound has been stabilized., Use ripped or cut garments like T-shirts, pants, or socks. Place the pressure dressing on top of the regular dressing.


Protect the wound and guard against making the bleeding worse. If you need to remove the pressure dressing for any reason, the regular dressing will be in place to prevent disturbing any clot which has formed in the wound., Take a longer piece of cloth and wrap it firmly around the wadded bandages. Tie the ends together. Apply enough pressure to help gain hemostasis, but do not create a tight tourniquet-like effect. One finger should be able to fit under the knot.After you apply the securing bandage, check the fingers or toes past the bandage to ensure that they are still pink and warm. If not, loosen the bandages and try again.

, Reassess the limb to make sure the bleeding has stopped. Additional treatment may be indicated. Look for signs of decreased circulation in the limb, as well. There is a risk of tissue loss if a bandage impedes bloodflow for too long.Loosen the pressure bandage if the extremity becomes cool, blue, numb, or loses the pulse below the pressure dressing. When there is inadequate oxygen delivery to the limb, tissue can begin to die off and the limb could be compromised to the point of requiring an amputation., Use the improvised bandages or bandages from a first-aid kit to apply manual pressure on the torso (chest and abdomen) and head in a very specific way. Use extreme caution when applying compression to these areas.Change your technique when applying a pressure dressing to the torso. The first steps are the same. Do not remove any objects from the wound. Apply the regular dressing. Tape this dressing, if you can. But, do not secure the dressing by wrapping cloth around the injured person. This could compromise the victim’s ability to breathe. Wad the cloth or bandages over the regular dressing on the wound. Apply enough manual pressure over the wad to stop the hemorrhage without interfering with the injured person’s breathing. Maintain this compression for 15 minutes. Continue the manual pressure if there are signs of continuing hemorrhage, such as a soaked dressing or blood dripping around the regular dressing.You will have to continue this compression until medical personnel arrive or until the wound begins to clot.
Do not apply any pressure to a head wound if the victim’s skull appears deformed. Look for sunken areas, visible bone fragments, or exposed brain tissue. Do not apply pressure to a wound which involves the eye or when an object in the wound clearly pierces the skull. Cover the wound GENTLY with bandages, have the person lie down, and get him medical attention as soon as possible. Keep adding more bandages on top if the dressing gets soaked.Assess the head wound and make sure pressure can be applied safely. Establish which dressing will be considered the regular dressing, even if it is not secured, and do not remove it.
Apply manual pressure on wadded cloth or bandages over the regular dressing for 15 minutes. If the hemorrhage continues, reapply the manual pressure until medical personnel arrives.
Wounds on the head bleed a lot because there are a lot of blood vessels close to the surface of the skin, so have plenty of extra dressings handy if you have them available.Keep in mind that hair makes it hard to use tape and even long pieces of cloth wrapped around the head have a tendency to slip. Do not waste time trying to secure a regular dressing.
Never wrap anything around the neck.

, Use a tourniquet when no other technique (elevation, manual pressure, or a pressure dressing) has worked. A tourniquet compresses arteries and veins very firmly. There is very little blood flowing past the point of the tourniquet, thus preventing hemorrhage from the wound A tourniquet can be anything like a special device, a belt, or a long piece of cloth. It is used for limbs only. The best location to wrap the tourniquet is within 1-3"" of the wound site, to minimize tissue death/damage. The tourniquet must be closer to the heart than the wound.Put something, a piece of cloth or the person’s clothing, under the tourniquet to protect the skin. Do not remove the tourniquet once it is placed.
It does not take too much constant pressure to impede blood flow. However, a tourniquet is not a bandage like a pressure dressing. It is a very, very tight band around a limb. There is a definite risk of tissue loss and ischemia. Weigh the risk of loss of a limb versus the loss of life."

Review the patient’s medical record.,
Ask the patient about medications.,
Interview the patient about alcohol, cigarette, and recreational drug use.,
Confirm that the patient has abstained from food and fluid as instructed.",How to Administer General Anesthesia1," Before administering anesthesia, the anesthesiologist will review the patient’s medical record. This review process helps to ensure that the medications the patient receives is the safest and most effective for each for. The anesthesiologist will look at a patient’s:Age
Weight
Medical history
Current medications including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal supplements
Prior anesthetic records, if available
Recent medical studies or specialist visits relevant to the type of anesthetic planned (for example, recent cardiology notes, echo reports)
Other relevant medical history and details relevant to the type of anesthesia planned
Allergies to medications and to food products;
, Next, the anesthesiologist will speak with the patient. The anesthesiologist will let the patient know what to expect and about the potential side effects of these medications.It is important for the anesthesiologist to know about any past reactions to anesthetics. If a patient has had a bad reaction to any anesthetic agents in the past or if the patient has a significant family history of problems with anesthesia, the anesthesiologist may choose to use different medications.

, The anesthesiologist will ask the patient about the patient's current use of alcohol, cigarettes, and recreational drugs. All of these substances have the potential to affect the way that a patient responds to anesthesia, so it is crucial for the anesthesiologist to learn this information.Cigarettes affect the heart and lungs, which can affect the type of anesthesia chosen and recovery process. Chronic obstructive lung disease can significantly impact a patient’s ability to recover from intubation. It is recommended to quit smoking at least eight weeks prior to any anesthetic to improve outcomes from anesthesia and to decrease the risk of surgical infection.
Alcohol affects the liver, heart, lungs, and blood, which are important in the administration of anesthesia. Chronic liver disease can significantly impact the choice and outcomes of anesthesia.
Current or past use of recreational drugs, such as cocaine, marijuana, or amphetamines, is important information for an anesthesiologist to learn. If cocaine or amphetamines are present in the bloodstream, they can lead to dangerous changes in blood pressure and even death under general anesthesia.
Remember that all conversations between patient and doctor or anesthesiologist are confidential. Not sharing this information it could increase the possibility of negative side effects from the surgery, including death — make sure the patient knows how essential it is that he be honest with you.

, Doctors instruct patients to abstain from food and fluid for a specific amount of time before surgery. However, the anesthesiologist will often confirm this information.Any food in the stomach during surgery increases the risk of aspiration during surgery. This is the medical term for when food and gastric contents rise up into the esophagus and enters the lungs during surgery. Even candy or chewing gum without swallowing can increase a patient’s risk of aspiration
Because general anesthesia also puts to sleep the musculature in your body you won’t have a gag reflex and will not be able to cough to protect your lungs. Do NOT eat or drink anything during the time period your surgeon gives you prior to surgery. Aspiration can lead to prolonged intubation and ICU stays, and sometimes even death.

Prioritize immobilizing the victim and applying a pressure dressing to the limb.,
Leave the victim’s clothing in place.,
Allow the snake bite to bleed freely for 15 to 30 seconds.,
Obtain a soft and flexible material for the pressure dressing.,
Apply the pressure dressing upwards on the limb.,
Immobilize the bitten limb with a splint.,
Check for pulses in the bitten limb.,
Keep the limb in a gravity-neutral position, if possible.,
Treat snake bites to the torso, head, and neck differently.,
Initiate antivenin treatment as soon as possible.,
Provide supportive care to the victim.",How to Apply a Pressure Bandage2," The pressure immobilization technique is thought to hinder the movement of venom from the bite site into the circulation. Make plans to reach medical personnel while treating the bite wound.Some research has shown that very little venom reaches the bloodstream if pressure is applied over the bite and the limb is immobilized, but this is still unproven.Go to places known to have poisonous snakes with at least three people. One can call or go for help while another treats the bite wounds., Keep the person and the injured limb as still as possible. Do not promote movement of the venom into the bloodstream. , Let venom be evacuated from wound. Letting the wound bleed while keeping it still will help to keep the venom out of the circulatory system.

During this expulsion phase, try to keep the limb lower than the heart to encourage the blood to expel the venom, rather than take it into the body.

, Use a flexible material like ace bandages or pantyhose, if available. Improvise and create a bandage by cutting or tearing something soft, like clothing or towels, into strips., Continue up the limb to cover the area of the bite, at minimum. Go up the limb as far as possible. Let only the amount of bandages limit you.Start wrapping on the foot and cross the knee for bites anywhere on the leg. Start wrapping at the fingers and cross the elbow for bites anywhere on the arm. Bites located on the very upper arm and thigh will be challenging to cover; you may have treat them like they are on the torso.This upward wrapping may squeeze a little venom towards the circulation. But it will be more comfortable and the injured person will tolerate it longer. The pressure dressing should be as tight as you would apply on a sprained ankle., Take care to cross the joint to maximize the restriction of movement. Do not allow the victim to move the limb to help apply the splint.Use any rigid object such as a branch, a tool with a handle, or rolled up newspaper. Wrap these objects with the same soft and flexible materials used to compress the limb before using them as splints., Loosen the dressing if there are no pulses; the dressing is too tight.You want the pulse to be strong and normal.


Check the pulse on top of the foot when the pressure dressing is on the leg. Check the pulse at the wrist near the thumb when the pressure dressing is on the arm., Venom can travel into the circulation if the limb is kept above heart level. Swelling can occur if the limb hangs below heart level.Lie the victim flat on her back with her arms at the side. She should not be moving anyway.

, Wad cloth or bandages and apply manual pressure over a bite on the torso. Take care not to restrict breathing. Do not give any first aid if the bite is on the head or neck. Keep the patient still no matter the bite location and seek medical assistance immediately., Do not remove the pressure dressing until right before the antivenin will be being given at a medical facility. Prompt treatment with antivenin will decrease the likelihood of morbidity (serious long-term side effects) and mortality (death) from the snake venom.Antivenin contains antibodies (the blood cells your body uses to destroy anything foreign) against specific poisons found in the venom of snakes. It is made from the blood of horses or sheep exposed to the specific venom.Do not listen to old wives’ tales about how to treat a snake bite. Do not apply mouth suction. Do not cut into the bite site. Do not apply hot or cold packs. Do not apply a tourniquet. Do not delay treatment trying to kill and bring in the snake.Treat the bite like it is from a venomous snake if you cannot identify the type of snake., Help him deal with any symptoms as they arise. Encourage him to stay still. But, antivenin therapy is the definitive treatment which will combat the poison(s) in the snake venom and help the victim feel better.Expect general signs and symptoms such as swelling and redness around the bite, pain at the bite site, difficulty breathing, vomiting and nausea, blurred vision, sweating and salivating, numbness in the face and limbs, and decreased level of consciousness. Each snake venom has different side effects and you also could see convulsions, low blood pressure, and paralysis."
"
Place an IV.,
Intubate the patient.,
Be aware of the potential complications from intubation.,
Take extra precautions if the patient is at risk for complications from intubation.,
Monitor the patient’s vitals.",How to Administer General Anesthesia2," Prior to being taken to the surgical suite a nurse or anesthesiologist will put an intravenous line (IV) into the patient’s arm. The intravenous (IV) line in the patient’s arm will be used during surgery. In many cases a second IV is inserted in the other arm after the patient is under anesthesia.


The patient may receive a sedative in the preoperative area before moving to surgery. The sedative will help the patient to relax.An anesthetist may have to use more medication to achieve general anesthesia if a patient is highly anxious.
Prior to surgery, the patient will go to sleep by receiving general anesthetics through the IV and sometimes through a face mask as well. Delivering the anesthesia through the mask alone is also an option that may be used in some cases. For example, if the patient is a child who is afraid of needles, then a mask may be used to administer medications.This option, called “mask induction,” is not often used in adults or larger children, because it can be less effective and risky to induce general anesthesia without first securing an IV.

, Because many anesthetic medications will prevent patients from breathing adequately on their own, the anesthesiologist will want to secure the patient’s airway, usually with either a laryngeal mask airway or an endotracheal tube. Placement of an endotracheal tube is called intubation. In this procedure, the anesthesiologist will place a tube into the patient’s trachea in order to protect the lungs and help the patient breathe during surgery. This tube will be hooked up to a machine that will help the patient breathe during the procedure.


The endotracheal tube used in intubation is a flexible plastic tube that goes through the patient’s mouth with the help of an instrument called a laryngoscope. This instrument helps the anesthesiologist lift up the tongue and pharynx, or tissues of the mouth, in order to see well enough to pass the tube into the patient’s lungs.
Because intubation usually happens when the patient is asleep, patients may occasionally have a cut lip or chipped tooth if placement of the endotracheal tube was difficult. It is important for patients to notify their anesthesiologist if they have loose teeth, which can increase this risk.
After surgery, some patients will have a sore throat from the endotracheal tube. This can last one to two days and is a normal side effect of intubation

, Complications from placing the tube down the esophagus toward the stomach instead of the lungs will result in inadequate oxygenation, brain damage and possibly death. For this reason a qualified and experienced physician places the endotracheal tube and checks placement before the start of surgery. Other complications from endotracheal intubation include:Knocking out a tooth during insertion of the tube, or intubation
Damage to the lips, teeth or tongue
Low blood pressure from the anesthetic medications
Lung infection, such as pneumonia, more so with prolonged intubation

, Some patients are at a higher risk of complications from intubation, which is why it is so important to review the patient’s medical history and perform a physical exam. Patients that are at high risk for a difficult intubation may require an awake intubation, which can be performed with numbing medicine and sedation. This is done to ensure the patient’s safety, and after the endotracheal tube is in place, the anesthesiologist will then provide anesthesia medications.Factors that increase the risk of difficult intubation include:Neck or cervical spine injury that limits flexion or extension of the neck
Thick neck circumference
Small mouth opening
Small chin or inability to move the jaw forward
Previous head or neck radiation or surgery
Recent meal

, Once the patient is under anesthesia from IV or inhaled induction, with a secure airway and appropriate ventilation, the anesthesiologist will monitor the patient’s vital signs and treat the patient with a variety of medications and fluids to keep her stable throughout surgery. The anesthesiologist will communicate with the surgeon throughout the procedure to ensure the patient’s safety. The vital signs that the anesthesiologist will monitor include:Oxygen saturation levels
Heart rate and rhythm
Blood pressure
Respiratory rate
Body temperature
Blood loss
Urine output, depending on the type of surgery
Central venous pressure, depending on the type of surgery
Cardiac output and other invasive cardiac monitoring, depending on the patient or type of surgery

"
"
Keep the patient under anesthesia until the procedure is over.,
Take the patient to the recovery room.,
Watch for common side effects.,
Seek immediate medical treatment for more serious side effects.,
Be aware of the potential for serious complications.",How to Administer General Anesthesia3," The patient will continue to receive medication to stay sedated until the surgeon has completed his or her procedure. After the procedure is complete, the anesthesiologist will reduce the use of the medication. Before removing the endotracheal tube the anesthesiologist will ensure that the patient:Is breathing adequately without assistance
Has stable vital signs
Has had appropriate medications and reversal agents, if necessary
Can follow basic commands and demonstrate good muscle strength, usually by lifting his or her head or squeezing somebody’s hands

, After the endotracheal tube has been removed and the patient has been weaned off the anesthesia, the patient will be taken to the recovery room. In the recovery room, expert nurses will monitor the patient’s vital signs (oxygen saturation, heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and temperature) to ensure that everything is normal. The nurse will also monitor for and treat common side effects of anesthesia and surgery, including pain and nausea.

, Like any other medical procedure, there can be side effects from general anesthesia. Most of these side effects will go away soon after surgery, but if any of these side effects are severe or persistent, seek medical attention right away. Common side effects of general anesthesia include:Nausea
Vomiting
Sore throat
Confusion
Muscle aches
Chills/shivering
Itching

, Some patients may also experience more serious side effects from general anesthesia that require medical care from a doctor. Serious side effects that require medical attention include:Difficulty breathing
Signs of infection, such as fever or chills
Chest pain or pressure
Heart palpitations
New weakness
Arm or leg swelling and/or fatigue, which can be signs of heart failure

, After surgery, you may be at higher risk for developing other more serious complications. Notify a doctor right away if the patient suffers from any complications. Some complications to watch out for include:Postoperative delirium. This complication causes confusion and memory loss which can last longer than a few hours. Some patients are at a higher risk, such as people who are transferred to intensive care after surgery, as well as those with heart disease, lung disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, or who have had a stroke.

Learn about local anesthesia.,
Find out about regional anesthesia.,
Ask about conscious sedation.",How to Administer General Anesthesia4," Unlike general anesthesia, local anesthesia will only numb a small part of the body. This type of anesthesia is used only for minor procedures. The patient may be awake during the procedure., Regional anesthesia will block the perception of pain from a larger portion of the patient's body. In this case the patient may also receive a sedative. Regional anesthesia can be provided as an alternative to general anesthesia, or sometimes in combination with general anesthesia. There are two types of regional anesthesia.

Peripheral nerve block. In this procedure, anesthetic is injected adjacent to a specific group of nerves.
Epidural or spinal anesthesia. In this procedure, local anesthesia is injected near the spinal cord, which blocks pain from the nerves in the spine. This will block pain in a region of the body such as the chest wall, hips, legs or belly., Conscious sedation is a type of anesthesia involving sedation without being entirely ""asleep"" or unconscious. This option allows a patient to be somewhat sedated and comfortable while undergoing surgery.Most of the time a nurse, doctor or dentist will administer the sedation using a medication that wears off quickly.
The medication is given through an IV and requires monitoring every three to five minutes.
The patient will likely get oxygen through a mask during the procedure.
Patients often fall asleep but will wake easily and respond to people in the room upon waking.
Some medications used also induce amnesia so the patient may not remember much about the procedure.
The patient may hear voices and drift in and out of sleep, all of which would be normal for conscious sedation. Awareness during conscious sedation does not mean the patient “woke up” during surgery and it is an expected part of this mild type of sedation.

Follow your doctor’s instructions.,
Keep an eye out for nosebleeds or pain.,
Watch for side effects.,
Store your Nasonex properly.",How to Administer Nasonex," In order to get the full benefits of Nasonex, your nose needs to be clear of obstructions. This ensures that the medication gets deep into your nose. Gently blow your nose to clear any mucus or other obstructions out of your nose.Sniff air through each nostril after blowing your nose to make sure that you’ve cleared the passage. If you can’t do this, gently blow your nose again. Not clearing your nasal passages keeps Nasonex from going deep into your nose.;
, Before you begin administering your Nasonex, shake the bottle gently several times.This can ensure that nothing has settled in the bottle and that you get the full benefits of Nasonex.


Remove the Nasonex cap when you’re finished shaking it.

, If it is your first time using your Nasonex prescription or you have not used it in a week or longer, you’ll need to prime the applicator pump. Doing this ensures that you get a fine and even mist for optimal use.Push the pump a few times into the air until a consistent fine mist comes out. If you notice any problems with the pump or applicator, contact your pharmacist.

, After you’ve primed the Nasonex, you’re almost ready to administer it. Keep the bottle upright as you place your forefinger on one side of the applicator and your middle finger on the other side.Use your thumb to support the base of the bottle., It may seem better to tilt your head backwards, but this can cause Nasonex to go down your throat instead of into your nasal cavity. The best way to ensure that you’re getting the full benefit of Nasonex is to tilt your head forward slightly.Breathe out slowly as you tilt your head. If you notice any mucus or obstructions in your nose, blow it again.
Make sure that you don’t have any hair or clothing in your face that may cause you to itch or sneeze. This can keep you from getting the proper amount of Nasonex.

, Once you’re head is in the proper position, insert the applicator into your nostril. Close off the other nostril with a free finger. Aim the application towards the back of your head for optimal placement of the medication.Keep your aim as straight as possible so that you don’t waste medication.You can also point the applicator away from the center ridge of your nose and towards the corner of your eye on the same side if it is more comfortable., As you slowly and gently inhale, push down on the applicator once with your fingers. You should feel the light mist of Nasonex inside your nose. When you’re finished, remove the nozzle from your nostril.Exhale through your mouth when you’re finished. It’s important to not breathe out through your nose so that the medication doesn’t dribble out.
Finish administering the prescribed number of sprays into your nostril.

, Just after you’ve finished spraying the allotted dose, try to not blow your nose or sneeze. This can dislodge Nasonex and keep you from getting the benefits of a full dose.Avoid taking an extra dose if you sneezed or had to blow your nose. Simply skip it for that day and continue with your regular regimen.Try not sniffing too hard after your dose, which can cause the medication to end up in your throat instead of your nose., When you’re finished administering the proper dose in one nostril, it’s time to switch to the other side of your nose. Repeat the steps for properly getting your Nasonex dose in the opposite nostril. Making sure to use Nasonex in both nostrils can ensure that you reap the full benefits of the medication.Return the plastic cap to the applicator when you’re done. This keeps dirt and bacteria from accumulating on the tip and making you sick.

, You may need to give a friend or another member of your family Nasonex at some point. You can do this after the person has blown his or her nose and you have prepped the bottle.Have the person sit with his or her head slightly forward. Ask him or her to breathe out slowly while in this position.
Put the tip of the bottle in the just into the nostril and ask the person to block the other side of the nose. If he or she is not able, you can also block the opposite nostril. Have the person slowly inhale through the open nostril as you push the spray nozzle.
Repeat the procedure for other nostril.

, Children over the age of 3 generally understand if you tell him or her that it’s time to take medication. If your child is resisting his or her dose of Nasonex, be honest and don’t lie to make the situation better. Appealing to your child’s sense of reasoning may make administering the Nasonex easier.Let your child know that you understand he or she hates getting Nasonex. Tell him or her that it will be easier to get it over quickly.
Tell your child why it’s important to take Nasonex. Ask him or her why the medication is important, which can start a conversation that makes getting the Nasonex easier.Reassure your child and be as honest as possible. Say, “I know the Nasonex feels weird, Anna. Letting me squirt it into your nose will make you feel better. Just think, if you take it, you can go play with your friends.”

, Your reactions can impact how your child reacts to taking Nasonex. Even if you feel badly, smiling and being cheerful may make it easier for your child to get the dose of medication.Give yourself a pep talk before you approach your child. Remind yourself that it will be quick and painless for you and your child. Then say, “Hey Joe! What are you watching? Let’s take a minute to squirt your Nasonex and then we can watch together.” Remember to keep your facial gestures and voice as positive as possible.

, Occupying your child with stuffed toys, singing a favorite song, reading a book, or watching TV may make administering Nasonex easier.Let your child choose what he or she does while you administer the Nasonex. Allowing your child to do something he or she likes can be a great way administer the medication.
Consider having your child read a book or watch something on a tablet. This will naturally have the child bow down his or her head, which can make administering Nasonex much easier and quicker.Say, “Hi Christopher! It’s time to squirt in your medicine to make you feel better. Do you want to read a book or watch a movie or show on the tablet?”

, If your child is being uncooperative, enlist the help of a friend or loved one. This may not be pleasant for any of you, but it can help get the process over quickly.


Hold the child on the lap of one adult. This person can also keep the child’s hands and head from moving. The second person can then administer the Nasonex.
Say, “I’m really sorry we had to give you medicine by holding you. If your let me give it to you next time, no one has to hold you.” Provide your child some reassurance or extra love.

, It’s easiest if you have your child sit in a chair or on the lap of another adult. This allows you to stand or squat down in front of your child to best administer the Nasonex.Make sure your child is sitting in a comfortable chair or on the sofa. Letting your child pick the chair may also help him or her feel more in control of the situation.

, Once your child is comfortably seated, have him or her tilt down his or her head as though he or she is reading a book. This can ensure the Nasonex goes into the nose and doesn’t drip down the throat. Letting your child read a book or watch something on a tablet can get your child to naturally tilt his or her head, which will make administering the Nasonex easier., Place the Nasonex bottle tip straight back in your child’s nostril. Tilt the nozzle outward to your child’s eye or ear on that side of his or her head. Then press the nozzle for the proper number of sprays.Ask your child if he or she is ready to do the other nostril when you’re finished giving a dose in one nostril.
Dab off any Nasonex that may run out of your child’s nose. Tell him or her not to sniff back the medication.

, If your child did a good job getting his or her Nasonex, offer a little treat. It can be something small but special like a sticker or other trinket. You could also place gold star stickers on a board after he or she has taken the medication. If your child has a gold star for getting Nasonex each time, after ten stickers (or whatever number you choose) you can give him or her a treat such as a trip to a favorite restaurant or the zoo., It can take up to 2 weeks of taking Nasonex before your notice its effects. If you have seasonal allergies or know you’re going to be around something to which you’re allergic, begin using Nasonex about two weeks before exposure.Check to make sure your Nasonex hasn’t expired, especially if you don’t use it consistently. Although the dose may still be effective, the tip could have been exposed to dirt or bacteria that could make you sick., Your doctor will give you specific instructions about how to take your Nasonex. This includes a specific dose, which you shouldn’t exceed. It’s important to closely follow your doctor’s instruction to ensure you get the optimal dose and minimize your risk of side effects.Ask your doctor any questions you have about the drug, your dose, or how to best administer it in your nose. Using Nasonex consistently and regularly can ensure that it works best for you.Tell your doctor right away if you are planning to become pregnant, are pregnant, or breastfeeding. It is currently unknown if Nasonex can pass to your baby through breastmilk. Your doctor will discuss whether it’s best to continue using Nasonex or try another drug.Let your doctor know if you have a history of glaucoma or cataracts. It’s also important to tell your doctor if you have tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or herpes simplex of the eye. Make sure he or she is aware of any exposure to chickenpox or measles, especially if your immune system is suppressed. Use of Nasonex with these conditions can make them worse or compromise your immune system., You may experience some pain or stinging if you use Nasonex, especially over a longer period of time. You may also even notice nosebleeds. If this happens, stop using the spray for one or two days. This can give your nostrils a chance to rest and minimize the risk of further irritation.Contact your doctor if your nosebleeds are severe.
Try an over-the counter saline spray before using Nasonex. This can moisturize your nasal passage and make it less uncomfortable to inhale your Nasonex.Avoid using the saline spray after you administer your Nasonex because this can wash the medication out of your nasal cavity., Like all medications, Nasonex can cause side effects. Although most are not serious, you should watch for side effects and let your doctor know if you’re experiencing any of them.Common side effects include: headaches, viral infections, sore throat, nosebleeds, coughing, dryness and irritation in the nose or throat, mucus of phlegm that contains a small amount of blood.
Call your doctor right away if you notice any of the following side effects: pain or sores in your mouth, white patches in your nose or mouth, painful swallowing or trouble swallowing.
Seek immediate medical attention if you experience the symptoms of an allergic reaction. These include: rash; itching of the tongue, throat, or face; severe dizziness; trouble breathing.

, How you store you Nasonex can make a difference in its ability to treat your allergies. Sunlight and heat can degrade your medication, cause it to lose potency or harm your health. Keeping your Nasonex in a cool place away from the sunlight can ensure you get the full benefits of the medication.Put your medication in a room that is between 58 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit. Move the bottle if the room temperature falls below 58 degrees or rises above 86 degrees.
Remember that part of proper storage is throwing away your Nasonex after you’ve used the allotted number of sprays. Each bottle comes with 120 measured sprays.

Check the height of the handgrip.,
Adjust the height of the handgrip.,
Check the adjusted height.,
Fix the crutches at the right height.",How to Adjust Forearm Crutches1," The first thing to do when you are adjusting crutches is to measure where the handgrip is in relation to your height. Stand up straight, relax your shoulders, and let your arms hang down loosely at your sides. Ask someone to help you balance if necessary, and place one crutch at your side. Check to see where the handgrip is in relation to your arm. It should be level with your wrist.


Make sure you keep your arm hanging down at your side, fully extended.If the handgrip is not level with the crease of your wrist you will need to adjust it.;
, If, after checking the height, you discover that you need to adjust the height of the handgrip, you will need to locate the spring buttons on the leg extensions of your crutches. There will be a small button or protruding metal knob along a series of small holes on the side of each crutch.


To adjust the height you simply have to push in this button and shorten or lengthen the leg extension by pushing it up or pulling it down.If it doesn't move, the spring button is probably not completely pushed in.

, Once you think you have the crutches at the right height you can do a quick test to check. Stand normally and take hold of the handgrips as you would if you were using the crutches. Now look at the angle of your elbow. Your elbow should be bent somewhere between 15 and 30 degrees.You can look in a mirror or ask someone to judge the angle for you if you can't see it.
Be sure you check that both crutches are the same height., Once you have successfully adjusted the height of the crutches you need to fix them in place so they don't shift around. The first thing to do is ensure that the spring button is securely in place in the hole you have moved it to. It should be firm and you should not be able to move the leg extension up or down.


After checking this, tighten the ring you can find below all the adjustment holes.
This ring is called the collar, and you can tighten it like you would a screw or a jar lid."

Try scooting.",How to Walk on Crutches," Before you position the crutches, make sure you're wearing the shoes that you'll wear for normal, everyday activity. This will make sure that you're at the right height when you adjust your crutches., Using crutches at the incorrect height can lead to nerve damage in the armpit area.You should have about 1 ½ inches between your armpit and the top of the crutch when the crutches are in a normal position. In other words, the pads on the crutches should not be squeezed to your sides or an unnecessary distance from your body.When you use the crutches, you will place the arm pads under your armpits, not right inside them.

, Adjust your crutches so that when you are standing upright with your hands at your sides, the handles sit just under your palms. The arm guards should be about 1 inch or 3 centimeters above your elbow.


When you first get crutches, your doctor or a nurse may help you adjust them for the first time., You can reposition this piece by removing the wing nut and sliding the bolt out of the hole. Slide the hand bar to the appropriate location, insert the bolt, and fasten the nut., There may options for devices other than crutches, depending on the type of injury.


A walker or cane may be an option if you are allowed to bear some weight on the leg.Crutches require a fair bit of arm and upper body strength. If you are weak or elderly, your doctor may recommend a wheelchair or walker instead., You can ask your doctor about physical therapy, which is a commonly recommended option when you need to use crutches. A physical therapist will help you learn how to use crutches properly and can monitor your progress. Because crutches are often prescribed after an injury or surgery, you may need rehabilitation as well.Your doctor may recommend at least a few sessions with a physical therapist to help you get the hang of crutches. If you cannot put any weight on your leg, your doctor will likely send you to the physical therapist before you leave the hospital so that you can learn how to move around properly.If you have had surgery on your leg or knee, you will likely need to see a physical therapist for rehabilitation. Your PT will make sure that you are stable and able to walk safely using your crutches. The PT will also work with you to develop your strength and mobility.

, The crutches should be positioned straight up-and-down to begin. Position the shoulder pads slightly wider than your shoulders so that you can fit between the crutches when you stand up. The feet of the crutches should be next to your feet, and the pads should be underneath your arms. Place your hands on the hand pieces., Push down on the hand pieces of the crutches as you stand up, keeping your injured leg or foot off of the floor. All of your weight should be on your good leg. You may want to ask for help from a friend or family member.If you need to, hold on to something stable like a piece of heavy furniture or a railing while you are adjusting to moving around independently.

, To take a step, start by placing the foot pads of the crutches a short distance in front of you, ensuring that they are slightly wider than shoulder width apart. The distance should be short enough that you feel stable, about 12 inches. When stable and ready, lean on the crutches by loosely gripping and then pushing against the handles and straightening your arms, transferring your weight onto your arms. Swing your body slowly through the gap between the crutches, lifting your good leg and moving it forward. Place the foot of the good leg flat on the ground, keeping the other leg next to the good leg. Repeat the process until you get to your destination.


When pivoting, pivot with the strong leg, not the weak leg.As your injury begins to heal you will feel more comfortable taking larger steps but the crutches should never be much farther forward than your bad foot's toes; otherwise, you'll most likely be caught off balance and increase the possibility of falling. Be careful especially the first few days on the crutches. They can be a challenge to many people.

, Lean on the crutches and swing forward, slowly shifting your weight forward using your forearms, not your elbows. Be sure to have a slight bend to the elbow, and use your arm muscles; do not lean on your armpits.


When leaning, don't lean on your armpits; it will hurt and may cause you to develop a painful rash. Instead, lean on your hands using your arm muscles.
You can put socks or a rolled up towel on the armpit pad to help prevent a rash.Leaning on the armpit can lead to a condition called radial nerve palsy. If this happens, the wrist and hand can become weak, and occasional the back of the hand can lose feeling The good news, is if the pressure is relieved, the injury usually heals itself.
Leaning on the armpit could also cause brachial plexus injury, or ""crutch palsy,"" or rotator cuff tendonitis, which causes inflammation and pain in the shoulder and outer arm., Doing so may cause a cramp in your fingers and increase numbness in your hands. Try to relax your hands as much as possible. To avoid cramps, try to keep your fingers cupped so the crutches 'drop' into your fingers when leaving the ground. This will relieve pressure on your palms and let you walk farther with much less discomfort.

, Using a messenger bag or a handbag on one side could interfere with your crutches. It may also throw you off balance. Use a backpack to carry things around when you're using crutches., Balance on your good leg and put both crutches under the arm on the same side as your weak leg. Use your other hand to feel behind you for the chair. Slowly lower yourself into the chair, lifting your weak leg as you sit.When you are seated, lean your crutches upside-down in a nearby spot so they don’t fall over out of reach.

, Stand facing the stairs, and whichever side the banister/railing is on, put that crutch under your arm on the opposite side. You should now have one hand free to hold the railing and one hand with a crutch to take weight, with the second crutch resting under your arm.


If possible, have someone carry the unused crutch for you.
Whenever possible, take the elevator instead of the stairs while you are on crutches., The crutch should be next to you, on the outside of your good leg. You should hold the banister or handrail with the hand that is on the same side as your bad leg. Leave the crutch in place until you have stepped up, then move the crutch up to meet you on your current step. Do not lead with the crutch.

, Use that leg to move the rest of your body weight up. Then follow with the crutch, so that the crutch is on your current step with you. Now repeat that until you get to the top of the stairs. Your good leg should do the majority of the lifting, and your arms should be used just for support and balance. Coming down stairs, you should put your bad leg and crutch on the step down, then use your good leg to move your body weight down. If you get confused about which way it goes, the good leg is always the highest on the stairs, as it always takes the strain of moving your body's weight. Try to remember the saying, “Good leg up, bad leg down” Good leg goes first when you go up the steps, the bad (injured) leg is first when going down the steps.
With practice you can also use both crutches to take the stairs, but you need to be very careful on steps. The same concept is done, “down with the bad leg.”, If you feel too unsteady on the stairs, you can sit on each step and scoot your bottom up and down. Start with sitting on the bottom step with the injured leg in front of you. Scoot your body up and sit on the next step, hold both crutches with you in the opposite hand and moving up the steps with them. When going down, do the same. Take your crutches in the free hand and use your other hand and good leg to support yourself while going down."

Investigate the legality of changing the settings.",How to Adjust Pressure on a Respironics CPAP Machine," When you sleep overnight in a specialized sleep laboratory and get diagnosed with sleep apnea, the team of doctors will determine what the optimum average constant pressure is for you on your CPAP machine. The process by which they figure out the most appropriate air pressure is called a titration study.A titration study is done with a mask and air machine for the purposes of calibrating a CPAP machine to a level that stops your sleep apnea events.


The events are measured in a point system called an apnea hypopnea index. An index below five indicates no sleep apnea.

Mild OSA: AHI of 5-15. Involuntary sleepiness during activities that require little attention, such as watching TV or reading
Moderate OSA: AHI of 15-30. Involuntary sleepiness during activities that require some attention, such as meetings or presentations.
Severe OSA: AHI of more than 30. Involuntary sleepiness during activities that require more active attention, such as talking or driving.Sleep clinics typically do not recommend that new CPAP users change their pressure settings until they've had their first sleep study and used the prescribed pressure settings for several weeks at minimum.
While you are in the sleep lab, the doctor or sleep specialist may also:Measure your activity levels and movement as you sleep
Record your brain activity, eye movements, blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels
Fine-tune the fit of your mask and the air pressure settings

;
, Doctors and manufacturers recommend that the air pressure settings of your CPAP machine be personalized for you by a medical professional based upon a titration study at a sleep clinic — you should then use those recommended settings for at least a few weeks to get used to them at night. If you think those initial settings need to be adjusted, you should contact your doctor or sleep clinic to have them checked.Adjustment of the air pressure settings may be necessary when:You gain or lose weight
You are extra tired
You have had a few alcoholic drinks
You are on prescribed sedatives
You have sinus congestion
You are using a different mask
You are at a different altitude
You have jet lag
You change stages in your sleep cycle

, If you're considering changing your CPAP air pressure settings, the safer method is to upgrade from a constant-pressure machine to an auto-CPAP machine.These fully automated machines continually measure the air pressure needed to keep your airways open and then self-adjust on a regular basis according to your ongoing needs.An auto-CPAP machine is likely the best long-term option, since your air pressure needs change day by day (and even hour by hour) as you sleep.
A one-time titration study within a sleep clinic cannot account for various personal changes that impact air pressure needs, such as: what sleep stage you're in, sleeping position, what you eat / drink, your body weight, and various drugs you take.
Auto-adjusting helps prevent you from swallowing air at times when your standard pressure is too high. Swallowing air can make people feel bloated and disrupt their sleep.

, Before you touch and manipulate the settings of your CPAP machine, make sure to read the operating manual and gain an understanding of your machine type and the available options. There are 2 main types of constant-pressure CPAP machines (data recording and non-data recording) and the methods used to adjust the pressure settings is dependent upon which type you have.A data recording machine usually stores patient data that is viewable on the machine or from a removable ""smart card"" or other memory card on your computer.
A data recording machine records several variables that help determine optimum air pressure, including your Apnea/Hypopnea Index or AHI.
In contrast, a non-data recording machine records very little or no health information or variables, so you're kind of adjusting these machines by feel.
Contact the manufacturer to obtain patient and clinician manuals to get a better understanding of your machine.

, Adjusting this type of Respironics CPAP machine is easier because you have data to guide you, particularly your AHI. You want to have an AHI of less than 5.0, which means that you experience less than 5 incidents of apnea or hypopnea per hour (considered normal sleep).If your AHI is already less than 5.0 (or even better, less than 3.0), then you shouldn't adjust the air pressure. If it's greater than 5.0, then read the instructions on how to increase the pressure.


Most CPAP machines have a range of adjustment from 4cmH20 (the lowest pressure) to 20cmH20 (the highest pressure).
For the Respironics CPAP machine, you need to highlight the Setup option on the display screen and then hold down the ramp and wheel buttons at the same time for a few seconds until you hear a few beeps.
After the beeps, access the Setup option and scroll down the menu to select the Auto Max and the Auto Min options. These represent the maximum and minimal pressures the machine oscillates between during the night.
Try increasing the Auto Min setting first (so it's closer to the Auto Max setting). After adjusting very slightly, leave it at that for a few weeks to adequately evaluate the improvement, or lack of sleep quality and daytime alertness.
You may have to increase both the Auto Max and Auto Min pressure settings, but use your AHI as a guide of how you're responding in the night while sleeping.

, Adjusting a non-data recording Respironics CPAP machine is more difficult because you don't have an objective AHI to guide you to either raise or lower the air pressure.Instead, you must use the very subjective ""how-do-I-feel"" approach when you wake up in the morning. If you don't feel rested upon waking or if your partner informs you of your sleep apnea / snoring / gasping, then you'll likely want to increase the pressure settings.


To change the settings on a non-data recording Respironics CPAP machine, follow the instructions above on how to change them on a data recording machine.
The main difference is that you won't be able to access the Data option beforehand to see your AHI.
In the vast majority of cases, people unhappy with the settings on their CPAP machine want to increase the pressure in order to get more air.
In a minority of cases, people may want to lower the settings because the pressure is too great and creating noisy leaks from their masks, causing bloating or leading to excessive dry mouth.

, Whichever type of CPAP machine you have, the key is making small adjustments and then see how your AHI number responds (a more objective measure), or how you feel in the morning after waking up (a completely subjective measure). As such, you should not change your air pressure more than 0.5 cm/H20 at any one time, on either your Auto Max or Auto Min settings.After the change, give it at least a week or so before you assess the effectiveness of the change.


Changing air pressure too much at a time can decrease the effectiveness of your therapy and potentially lead to dangerous health complications.
Always start by raising your Auto Min setting, which is often set between 5-8cm/H20, and then gauge effectiveness before changing the Auto Max setting — usually set at around 15cm/H2O.
Even if your have access to your AHI, keep a written log of how you feel each morning, afternoon and evening.
Don’t make dramatic lifestyle / dietary changes that could change your optimum air pressure and confuse you while altering settings to your CPAP machine.

, Sometimes the problem isn't actually with your air pressure — it has more to do with the type of mask you're wearing.The design of some partial and full-face breathing mask don't allow the air to flow through them (especially through the nose piece) as well as others. In essence, some masks create more resistance than others do.


Before changing your pressure settings on your Respironics CPAP machine, ask your doctor or sleep clinician to try a different type of mask.
Switching to a more comfortable mask may necessitate raising or lowering your pressure settings depending on it's design.
For many people, having a Auto Min setting greater than 10cm/H20 starts to cause uncomfortable side effects such as bloating, belching and dry mouth.

, It appears that changing your CPAP settings requires a prescription from your doctor because the machines are classified as Class II Medical Devices.As such, changing the settings requires a physician's oversight either directly (in person) or indirectly (faxed prescription). This gives you two options: going to your doctor's office with your machine, or calling the physician and getting them to fax the prescription (changed settings) to the medical equipment company.


If it's a hassle or too great of an expense to see your physician, call and talk to their secretary or nurse and explain that you want to change the settings and need a faxed prescription.
Alternatively, call the medical equipment company and ask them to contact the doctor’s office on your behalf.
Without proper medical training and licensing, changing the settings on a CPAP device can get you into legal trouble, so make sure you know the law in your area.

Check the position of the cuffs.,
Adjust the cuff position.,
Secure the cuffs in position.",How to Adjust Forearm Crutches2," After adjusting the height of the crutches you can go ahead any make any necessary adjustments to the cuffs. The cuffs are the ring-shaped pieces of plastic which you place your arm through when you are using the crutches. When you put your arm through and stand up, the cuffs should be situated around your forearm, just below your elbow.


Or, more precisely, one or two inches below the bend in your elbow.They should not restrict your ability to bend your elbow.

, If the cuffs are not in right place, you will need to make some adjustments to enable you to use the crutches easily and safely. Adjusting the cuffs is much like adjusting the height of the handgrip. Find the spring button in each cuff. The button will be at the back of the cuff, where it is attached to the crutch itself.


Push the button in and shift the cuffs up or down according to your requirements.You will see that the cuffs move up and down a series of adjustment holes that are visible along the side of your crutch.
If your cuff is more of a horseshoe shape and has an opening, the opening should be facing forward, the way you are facing.

, When you have the cuffs at the right height and they are comfortable, you can fix them in place. First, check that the spring button is secure and not too easy to push in. Next you just need to tighten the collars below the cuff on each crutch. You should also check that the collar you tightened after adjusting the height is still secure.


Sometimes with forearm crutches you can widen or narrow the width of the cuffs so you get a good fit around your arm. You want to be able to move freely, but with a secure fit."

To keep them from getting mixed up, which could cause you to inadvertently take the wrong medication, put matching labels on both the bottle and the lid.Use simple symbols that can be read from any angle and that you'll instantly recognize both by sight and by touch. For example, you might use a large black dot for a medication that you need to take every day, and two black dots for another medication that you have to take twice a day.
If you can distinguish colors, you might want to use different colors for medications that you must take in the morning as opposed to those that must be taken before bedtime.
You can also purchase a Braille label maker to make your own labels for your prescriptions.;
, If you cannot make out a symbol even when using a thick marker, you may be able to distinguish the shapes of different symbols by touch. Puffy markers allow you to create your symbols with raised surfaces so you can more easily differentiate between your medications.Make sure you practice with the symbols, so you know you can recognize them by touch.
You also want to take care not to make symbols that are too similar to each other, or could be easily confused without looking at them, such as an ""X"" and a triangle.
Keep in mind that puffy markers aren't incredibly durable, and may rub off over time. If you have long-term doses of a medication, you may want to clean the bottle and re-mark it occasionally to keep that from happening.

, Objects such as buttons, rubber bands, or cotton balls also can help you differentiate between medications. These can be helpful if you're having trouble coming up with symbols.Keep in mind you'll have to remember which object signified which medication. You may want to make an audio file with a master key that lists all of your medications and their associated objects, in case you forget.
Make sure the objects are glued securely to the bottle using a strong glue, so they won't come off with repeated touching.
You also want to practice and make sure you choose objects that are sufficiently distinct from one another, and that you can immediately recognize by touch.

, Some pharmacies have audio prescription labels available, which can help you quickly identify your different medications. To get the audio labels to work, you have to buy your own reader.When you set the prescription bottle down on the reader, it will identify the medication and provide you with dosage information.
To learn more about ScripTalk audio prescription labels, talk to your pharmacist. These systems are available at most major chain drug stores as well as some independent pharmacies.

, Don't count on your medical providers to convey this information to the pharmacy. Take it upon yourself to let them know that you are blind or visually impaired. This way, the pharmacy can make accommodations for you, such as using large print or braille on labels.If you can't clearly make out he instructions on the bottle, ask for a consultation with the pharmacist so they can explain how you should take the medication safely. It may be a good idea to consult with your pharmacist each time you get a new prescription to ensure there are no misunderstandings.

, Using a flat-bottomed basket or bin allows you to store the bottles so that all of the tops are accessible. This is important if you have an object or symbol on the top to mark type of medication.Make sure the sides are tall enough that you don't have to worry about a bottle falling out when you move the basket or bin.
Get a basket or bin in a dark color, so it will provide the most contrast against your pill bottles., If you have two different medications, particularly over-the-counter medications, that are used for similar conditions or symptoms, you need to differentiate them so you know which one you're taking.For example, if you have a bottle of acetaminophen and a bottle of aspirin, you might put the aspirin in the bedroom and the acetaminophen in the bathroom.
If memory is a problem, create an audio file to remind you where each medication is located.

, Rather than going through your large bottles of medication each day, traditional pill-sorter boxes that are divided by the day of the week are a simple and relatively mistake-proof way to organize your medications.You can get larger boxes that allow medications to be separated by morning and night as well. Larger boxes with more compartments also may be necessary to distinguish medications that are supposed to be eaten with food.
If you can read braille, find a pill-sorter box that has the days of the week written on the lid in braille.
It also may be helpful to leave the lids up on empty compartments after you've taken your medication that day, rather than closing it again. That way you can move your finger from left to right until you find the first un-opened compartment.

, If you have the ability to set auditory reminders on your computer or on your phone, they can be used to remind you when to take your medications, what medications to take, and what your doses are.Auditory reminders are particularly important if you're blind, because you won't be reminded by a visual cue such as seeing your bottles or your weekly pill-sorter box.
You might want to include other information in your reminders, such as where the pills are located or whether they need to be taken with food or water.

, An easy system is to line your bottles up alphabetically. As long as you know the names of your medications, this can be a good way to stay organized and know exactly where each medication is kept., If you have trouble keeping track of whether or not you took your medication, try putting rubber bands on your wrist or in your pocket or just near your medication bottles. When you take a dose, transfer the rubber band to the bottle, signifying that you took one dose. Remember to remove all the rubber bands at the end of the day so there is no confusion the next day., If you are still able to read labels, but need a flashlight or magnifying glass to do so, have these tools along with your medications. That way they'll be handy whenever you need them.If you're keeping your medications in several different locations, get several small magnifying glasses so you can have them where you need them. For example, you might put one in a kitchen cabinet and one in your bathroom's medicine cabinet.
You may still want to use your own labeling system, even if you are able to read the labels with a magnifying glass – especially if your vision is deteriorating. You don't want to wake up one morning and no longer be able to read, even with the magnifying glass.

, Whenever you're given a new prescription, make sure you understand how much you should take and when you should take it. You also need to understand how many doses are in each bottle, and when it needs to be refilled.Speak up if you have any questions about your medication, including side effects. You also need to find out what to do if you miss a dose. With some medications, if you miss a dose you can take it immediately, or double-up the next day. For others, however, you just skip it and take your regular dose the next day.
Find out in advance what you should do if you accidentally take more than your dose of the medication. This can be very dangerous with some medications and you would need to seek medical help right away. With others, you simply don't take your next scheduled dose.

, Audio recordings can be an important tool in managing your medications if you're blind or visually impaired. They give you the ability to quickly access information about each drug, including dosage information and when the prescription needs to be renewed.If you're seeing several specialists or have prescriptions from multiple doctors, include the doctor's contact information with each medication log.
You also should include information about what to do if you miss a dose, or if you accidentally take an extra dose.
Think about how the pills feel, and describe them in your audio log. This can be helpful if you spill a bottle or get caps mixed up.

, If you are diabetic and are blind or visually impaired, switching to a pre-filled insulin pen makes it easier to calculate the dosage you need. You can administer your doses yourself without having to worry about overdose.Note that these pens are not designed specifically for the blind or visually impaired, so you will need training and careful instruction on how to use them properly. Practice with your doctor or diabetes educator to ensure you can inject yourself with confidence.Pre-filled pens can be dialed to the specific amount of insulin you need to take. Since all pre-filled pens contain the same amount of insulin (300 units), you can easily calculate how long that pen will last you.
Often a pre-filled pen will not dial an amount larger than what is left in the pen, although some will. Ask your doctor if yours does this, because if it does you'll have to keep close tabs on the insulin remaining.
Before you use the insulin pen, tap it on the back of your hand to release any air bubbles and make sure the pen is working properly. It will release a small drop of insulin on the back of your hand as well. You should be able to feel it, or you can blow on your hand to detect the distinct odor of insulin.
The insulin pen is not your only option if you are blind or visually impaired and diabetic. You can use an Inject-Aid or Safe Shot Syringe Holder to hold an insulin bottle and syringe straight for easy insertion (these must be calibrated by a sighted person so you get the proper dose of insulin). You can also use Count-a-Dose, which uses a click-wheel so you can hear and feel a click for each unit of insulin, ensuring you get the proper dose., Especially if you have a long-term medication that's only supposed to be taken on an as-needed basis, you may run the risk of the drug expiring before you've taken all of it.Ask your pharmacist to tell you the expiration date for the medication when you pick it up, and you can set a reminder on your phone.
Some pharmacies also may have reminder programs that will call you when a medication is due to expire or about to run out.

Identify the symptoms.,
Ask the person if they need help to use their EpiPen.,
Call emergency services.,
Check for a medical ID necklace or bracelet.,
Hold the EpiPen firmly with your fist in the middle.,
Inject into the mid-outer-thigh.,
Remove the EpiPen.,
Prepare for possible side effects.,
Go to the hospital immediately.,
Keep the EpiPen in its case until it is needed.,
Look at the viewing window.,
Store your EpiPen in the right temperature.,
Check the expiration date.",How to Use an Epipen," Anaphylaxis can occur when a person is accidentally exposed to a known allergen, but it also can occur when a person is exposed to an allergen for the first time. It is also possible to become sensitized to an allergen, that is, to develop allergies to things that previously did not cause a reaction. In some cases the reaction can be so severe it can be life threatening. Look for the following symptoms:Flushing of the skin
Rash on the body
Swelling of the throat and mouth
Difficulty swallowing and speaking
Severe asthma
Abdominal pain
Nausea and vomiting
Drop in blood pressure
Collapse and unconsciousness
Confusion, dizziness or an ""impending sense of doom"";
, Anaphylaxis is considered a 'treat first' emergency. If the person knows they need an injection and can instruct you then help them first. The instructions for the EpiPen are printed on the side of the device., Even when using the epinephrine/adrenaline, it's still imperative to have professional help as soon as possible.


Always have your country's emergency number on your phone. In the U.S., the emergency number is 911. In the UK, 999 is the main emergency number. In Australia, dial Triple Zero (000).Tell the operator your location before anything else, so help can be sent immediately.
Describe the condition and the emergency to the operator.

, If you suspect a case of anaphylaxis in someone else, look for a necklace or bracelet. People suffering from severe allergies usually carry those in case of an accident.These necklaces and bracelets detail the condition and give additional information on health.
They usually bear a Red Cross sign or other easily recognizable visual clues.
If you suffer from severe allergies, always carry the instructions with the EpiPen. That way, if you are incapacitated and someone else has to administer it, they'll know what to do.
Don’t give the EpiPen to someone suffering from a heart condition unless they have their own based on a doctor's prescription., Do not put any part of your hand over either end to avoid an accidental trigger. An EpiPen is a single-use device; once it is triggered it cannot be re-used.


Avoid placing your finger over either end to avoid accidentally triggering the device.
Pull off the blue activation cap (opposite end from the orange tip that holds the needle)., Place the orange tip against the thigh and push firmly. There should be a click once the needle has entered the thigh.Hold for several seconds.
Do not inject in any other place than the thigh. Accidental intravenous injections of adrenaline can lead to death., Remove the unit and massage the injection area for 10 seconds.


Check the tip. The orange needle cover should automatically cover the injection needle once the EpiPen is removed from the thigh.

, When you give a person an EpiPen, it may cause them to feel panicked or paranoid, and can also cause their body to shake uncontrollably. This is NOT a seizure.The shaking will subside over the next few minutes or hours. Don't freak out; just try to be calm and reassuring. Your calm will help to settle the person.

, 20% of acute anaphylaxis episodes are quickly followed by another crisis, called biphasic anaphylaxis. Once you have administered or received the EpiPen, you should be seen by a doctor without delay.


The second episode might be mild or severe. If not treated, it can lead to a fatality.
The second crisis happens when patients seem to have recovered. It’s important to go to the hospital even if you feel fine.

, The carrier tube will protect the EpiPen so that it can safely be used when needed. Keep the safety release on until you need to use the EpiPen., Most EpiPens have a ""window"" that allows you to see through the packaging to the medicine inside. The medicine should be completely clear. If it looks cloudy or otherwise discolored, then that EpiPen has lost potency due to exposure to extreme temperatures.This can occur anytime before the expiration date. Depending on the temperature exposure and duration it may have lost significant or all of its potency. You can use it in an absolute emergency, but you should replace it as soon as possible.

, Your EpiPen can be kept in temperatures between 59° to 86°F (15° to 30°C). It should generally be stored at room temperature.


Do not refrigerate it.
Do not expose to extreme cold or heat.

, The EpiPen has a limited life and should be replaced when the date is approaching. An expired EpiPen might not be able to save the life of a patient experiencing anaphylaxis.If you don’t have anything else at hand, use the expired EpiPen. Degraded epinephrine loses potency but does not transform into a harmful compound. It’s always better than nothing.
Once an EpiPen has been used, it should be discarded safely. To do so, bring it to the pharmacy.

Knowing the law in your state will make the process easier and protect you from possible prosecution.


For example, California law allows licenses to be granted for a wide range of conditions such as cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or ""any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.""This last category is quite broad and has made it very easy to obtain a license in California.Other states, such as New Jersey, have stricter guidelines, requiring a ""debilitating"" medical condition and providing a less flexible list of eligible conditions.
State laws also vary regarding how much marijuana you can possess, and whether you can cultivate your own plants.Brief summaries of the law for each state that allows medical marijuana use are available here. Penalties for possession of marijuana outside the bounds of medical limits also vary by state and amount. The penalties for this offense in each state are summarized here.
Be aware that whatever the law may be in your state, possessing any amount of marijuana is still a misdemeanor at the federal level. Although federal agents generally do not pursue individual patients, there is still a very slight risk of federal prosecution.At the federal level, the penalty for a first-offense possession conviction is up to $1000 and a year in prison.Penalties are even more severe if you give or sell marijuana to others. Even if obtained legally, this is considered drug trafficking.;
, After reviewing the conditions for which medical marijuana is allowed in your state, consider whether or not you are eligible.


If you have been diagnosed with any of the conditions that are listed explicitly in your state's law, you are almost certainly eligible for a license.
If you haven't, it may still be possible for you to get a license. For example, if you have any symptoms that might be considered evidence of a condition for which marijuana can be authorized in your state, it is probably worth pursuing the matter further.
If you do not have any symptoms, you may not be able to obtain medical marijuana legally if you live in a state with a strict statute.
Most states also require you to prove residency to be eligible., If you think you may be eligible for a medical marijuana license, your next step is to find a doctor who is willing to authorize it. This could be your regular doctor if you have one, or it could be someone else.


If you think your regular doctor would be willing to authorize a marijuana license, the easiest thing to do is probably to visit him or her.
If not, there are some ways to find a doctor who is amenable to such authorizations. For example, you can contact your local dispensary as they are likely to have contact information on hand for a doctor in your area.
Although your primary care physician may not be able to issue a medical marijuana license, it is a good idea to keep your doctor informed and ask for a referral letter along with your medical history documents.
There are also numerous websites that provide directories of doctors who conduct medical marijuana evaluations in the states where it is legal, such as this directory from medicalmarijuana.com and this search feature from United Patients Group.

, Make an appointment and visit the doctor for your evaluation. Tell the doctor about your condition and why you think medical marijuana might be helpful to you.


If the doctor thinks your case is valid, he or she will provide you the authorization necessary to apply for a license from the state.
In states with more permissive restrictions, such as California, there are clinics that exist for the sole purpose of medical marijuana screenings. The staff at these establishments won't need much convincing: just tell them how marijuana might help you and you'll probably get approval.If you are seeing a regular doctor or live in a state with a stricter statute, you may need to be more persuasive. It's a good idea to go in the appointment with a good understanding of the law in your state, the research on how marijuana may be helpful for your condition, and information about the safety of the drug.If you've done your homework in advance, you'll be able to make a better argument.
It may be especially important to tell your doctor that, according to federal law, he or she cannot be prosecuted for discussing or recommending medical marijuana use.Concerns about being prosecuted, which date back to threats made in the 1990s, make some doctors hesitant to authorize or even discuss this option.In some states, written authorization from your doctor may be sufficient to purchase marijuana from a dispensary., Once you've received authorization from a doctor, most states will require you to fill out a form and enroll in a registry of approved patients.It's possible the approving doctor will have the necessary paperwork. Otherwise, it should be available online.
Depending where you live, you may be able to scan the paperwork and the physician's documentation to submit via the internet, as is the case in the state of New Jersey.In other places, you may need to submit the documentation in person, as is the case in San Diego County.Ask the doctor or find your state's requirements online.

, Most (but not all) states also require you to pay a fee to receive your license. How and when you pay your fee will vary by state, but there should be instructions available with your registration paperwork.


State fees range from $10 to $200., Even if your paperwork is approved, don't try to purchase medical marijuana until you've received your card.


In most states, it will take a few days to review your paperwork, and then your card will come in the mail.In California, some clinics that do medical marijuana screenings can issue you a card on-site., Most dispensaries and law enforcement will ask for the original document and in some places the card is not valid unless there is a seal and doctors signature., Once your card has arrived, you can visit a licensed dispensary and purchase marijuana.


In most dispensaries you must show your current state ID card along with your recommendation.
In many states, such as Arizona this is the only way to obtain medical marijuana legally.If you buy it from another source, you may still be in violation of state laws.

Think about what you eat and drink.",How to Sleep With an Insulin Pump," Much of the struggle of sleeping with an insulin pump is psychological. Keep in mind that it's only about the size of a cell phone. Trying to forget it’s there or to keep it from your mind may help aid the sleeping process. As long as you’re thinking about the pump, it will be difficult for you to get restful sleep.


Establish a safe and secure place for your insulin pump before going to bed so you don’t have to worry about its location while you’re trying to sleep.
Try not to let your mind focus on the feeling of the pump or accessories. Instead focus on things that help you sleep, such as the things found in How to fall asleep.
Give yourself time to get accustomed to using your insulin pump, changes take time to get used to, but most people find they can sleep easily with one after a short transition.;
, Part of the stress of sleeping with an insulin pump is based on how it may affect those you share your bed with. The easiest way to overcome this stressor is to speak openly with your family about your insulin pump.


Discuss the insulin pump with your significant other so you can both address any questions that may arise.
If you share a bed with your children it might be time to have them sleep in their own beds. Insulin pumps are resilient pieces of equipment but children could easily get tangled up in the tubes or play with the pump as you sleep.

, Insulin pumps are designed for everyday use and are surprisingly resilient. The longer you live with your pump, the more familiar you will become with it and how it works. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with it and learning what it’s capable of.Insulin pumps are built to be worn all day and slept with, so they can take a decent amount of punishment with little to no issue.
If you roll onto your insulin pump, it will not damage it. It may make you a bit uncomfortable, so you may wake up to roll over.
Insulin pump buttons are designed to be very difficult to press by accident, so even if you sleep on the pump, the chances of causing any issues are very low.

, Sleeping with an insulin pump is extremely safe. The pumps have been designed to be worn 24 hours a day and are very resistant to issues like crimped tubes or accidentally pressing a button, but you should still be aware of the risks and how to address an emergency if it were to arise. The biggest risk associated with sleeping with an insulin pump is if it were to stop working overnight for some reason.Keep the materials nearby that you will need to test your blood glucose levels and administer insulin via an injection if your pump were to stop working.
Keeping a snack made of simple carbohydrates near your bedside may be helpful in less severe situations.
The pump may be fitted with an alarm in the event there is an issue, but a power failure would yield no alarm. Most patients wake up as their blood glucose levels drop.

, You have a number of options when it comes to where to place your insulin pump for bed. One way you may find comfortable is clipped to the waistband of your pants or shorts.This method keeps the insulin pump close to you and reduces the chances of you getting tangled up in the hoses.
You may roll onto the pump, but once people get used to it, they tend to roll back over without waking up.
It is very unlikely that rolling onto your insulin pump will cause any issues, but be aware that it is possible.

, If you are uncomfortable with sleeping with your insulin pump attached to your clothing, you may choose to sleep with it on the bed beside you. Depending on the length of the tubes, you may want to inform your partner about where you place it.


This may be more comfortable as you are less likely to roll onto the pump as you sleep.
Be careful not to place your pump somewhere where it could easily fall off the bed.

, If you sleep with the insulin pump clipped to your clothing or near you in bed, you may want to take steps to ensure it won't irritate your skin. Bare plastic can cause you to itch or even create a rash.


Place the pump in a sock so the material of the pump can’t bother your bare skin.
Use an armband designed for iPhones or other large smartphones to cover the pump and even to wear it on your arm. Some people wear them on a wristband, in their underwear, shorts, or bra.
If you get up frequently at night, it may be best to wear your pump in this fashion or to clip it to your clothes to prevent dropping it.

, If you are nervous about rolling onto your insulin pump or pushing it off the bed, placing it near your bed on a nightstand or something similar may be best for you.Placing the pump on your nightstand may require longer tubing.
You will not roll over the pump nor will you knock it off the bed.
You run an increased chance of getting tangled up in the hoses, but chances of a malfunction are still low.

, For the first week or two, you will need to check your glucose levels very often to help you fine tune your insulin pump for your needs.Check your BG (Blood Glucose) levels eight to ten times per day for the first one to two weeks.
You or your doctor may need to adjust settings like your basal rate, target ranges or sensitivity factor to treatment based on your checks.
Your doctor may be able to give you a glucometer and prescribe you test strips in order for you to check you blood glucose levels frequently.

, Your body handles insulin treatment differently while you’re sleeping, so you need to check your levels often until you have your settings just right.Some people have hyperglycemia at night. One symptom of this is nocturia, which is increased nighttime urination.


Check your blood glucose levels right before bed and again when you wake up.
Check your levels midway through your night’s sleep or every three to four hours of sleep.
Discuss your readings with your doctor to ensure your overnight basal rates are set correctly.

, Even after you have your settings right, you should still check your blood glucose levels in evenings. Your body may change how well it handles the treatment and you may require alterations to your dosages or treatment plan. Check your blood glucose levels before you go to bed to help prevent high or low blood glucose levels while you’re asleep.
Check your levels when you first get up to make sure your blood glucose levels are high enough.
Occasionally check your blood glucose levels in the middle of the night to make sure you are still on the right course of treatment.

, Low blood glucose can occur when you make changes from the normal activity accounted for in your treatment plan. Be conscious of the things you do that may affect your body’s insulin levels.


Accidentally taking too much medication designed for diabetes treatment can dramatically lower BC levels.Skipping meals or eating less than usual can cause your blood glucose level to be lower than intended.
Exercising more than normal or right before bed can cause your blood glucose levels to drop while you sleep., You can identify problems before checking your blood glucose levels by learning what symptoms to look for when your blood glucose level drops dangerously.Waking up sweating can indicate that your blood glucose level is too low.
Waking up with a headache can also indicate low blood glucose levels.
Waking up as a result of a sudden nightmare may indicate your blood glucose levels are low.
Other symptoms include tremor, palpitations, anxiety, and seizure.

, Some nights are bound to break the norm and involve different levels of eating or drinking, just make sure you take that into account before bed.Don’t forget about what insulin you’ve already taken. Even fast acting insulin can remain in your system for up to four hours, so take all insulin you’ve taken recently into account when determining your dosage.
Don’t have midnight snacks. If you snack regularly, make a habit of adjusting your boluses to reflect your snacks.
Remember that alcohol can suppress a liver’s secretion of glucose, so have an extra snack (without insulin) at bedtime after drinking.

Do not put all of your weight on your armpits.,
Watch for skin irritation under your arms.,
Take breaks when using your crutches for long periods.,
Ask for help.,
Plan ahead.,
Be prepared for the jokes.,
Decide which kind of crutches you want.,
Ask as many questions as possible.,
Properly adjust the height of your crutches.",How to Adjust to Crutches," You have a multitude of nerves under your armpits, or brachial plexus. These nerves are responsible for sensation and movement for your arms and hands, and putting all of your weight on these nerves can cause nerve damage. To avoid this, hold yourself up with your hands and squeeze your upper arms into your crutches. But don't squeeze too hard because you might break a rib., Be prepared that you might develop red irritated areas under your arms from using the crutches over time. This is the result of the unavoidable constant rubbing of the crutches on the skin they come into contact with.


To help alleviate this irritation, put some Vaseline on the area of the skin that is bothering you.
Wear a sports bra if you're a girl; it will keep from the wire hurting as well. If you're a guy, try to wear more shirts; maybe layer them or wear an undershirt.
You can also wrap towels around the top of of the crutches and then tape them on with duct tap to provide more cushioning.

, If you feel yourself getting tired, stop and wait. If you’re in school, your teachers probably won't mind if you’re a little late to class. You could even ask the teachers if you can leave two minutes before the bell rings so you're not stuck in the hall gasping for air.

, More than likely people will be happy to help when they see you struggle. People might even offer to help you before you have to ask. If they offer, say yes. It will be hard doing all of the things you normally do by yourself, so enlisting the help of friends and family members will be a necessary evil for you during this time., Many simple life tasks are exponentially more difficult while you are using crutches. Things like grocery shopping and preparing food become especially challenging while you are restricted in how you can use your hands. The key is to plan ahead for what you’ll need for the week and get some help obtaining those items.If you go grocery shopping, carrying food can throw off your balance. If you put the goods you want to purchase in a bag, it can look like you are trying to steal it. To avoid these potentially embarrassing situations, prepare a list of what you’ll need for the week and ask someone to go shopping for you.
You can also use an online delivery service for these things if you can afford it.
If you are in school, then avoid wearing a backpack with books in it while you are using crutches. The extra weight can create extra unnecessary pressure on your armpits. Ask a friend to carry your books for you while you are using crutches.

, People can sometimes be cruel when they encounter someone with a disability or who appears different from them in some way. While you are using your crutches, you might get made fun of by someone like this because you are slower than usual, because you can’t do all the things you normally do, or simply because the crutches look different. If this happens to you, don’t take it personally. Just smile and keep moving forward.

, There are two kinds of crutches: underarm crutches and forearm crutches. Perhaps your doctor will have a preference about which kind he or she prefers you to use, but if the choice is up to you, do a little research to decide which kind would most benefit you.Underarm crutches: These are easier to master and maneuver than forearm crutches, but can lead to more soreness and discomfort from the way they press against your body during use.

Forearm crutches: These require more upper body strength than underarm crutches and can be more difficult to navigate initially, but they are better suited for long term use than underarm crutches.

, It will be helpful for you if you come to your doctor’s office prepared with the questions you want to ask. Once you leave the office, it may be harder to get the answers that you need. Ask questions that directly relate to the activities you perform in your daily life.Here are some general questions you may want to ask:Is it okay to rest your injured limb on the ground? Should you avoid placing any weight on it whatsoever?
Can you just use one crutch as a cane? What’s the best way to walk using this method?
How can you bathe? Is it okay to stand in the shower, or should you take baths instead?
What is the proper posture to maintain while using crutches?
Do you need to limit other physical activities like swimming or sex?

, Using crutches can be much more painful if you don’t properly adjust them to the dimensions of your specific body. Even if they were adjusted for your by a medical professional, sometimes these settings need adjusting once you start using them.Crutches should be adjusted while you are standing with the base of the crutches situated about six inches from the sides of your feet.
The underarm supports should be two inches below your armpits.
When you put your hands on the grips, your elbow should bend slightly.
If you feel like you have to hunch over when you are using your crutches, they are too short.

Learn what the rabies vaccine regimen entails.,
Be aware of possible side effects of the vaccine.,
Complete the treatment regimen.,
Bring a friend with you.,
Stay calm.,
Celebrate!,
Be aware that rabies, if untreated, can be fatal.If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal that you suspect may have rabies, it is critical that you seek medical attention promptly.,
Know which animals can carry rabies.,
Understand that ""surviving"" the rabies shots is your ""best shot"" at surviving.Therefore, as you prepare to get vaccinated, know that you are doing the right thing.",How to Survive Rabies Shots," Knowing what to expect can help to ease any anxiety around the procedure.Assuming you have been bitten or scratched by an animal with a risk of being infected with rabies, you will first receive the rabies immune globulin or IgG. IgG is an antibody that is effective immediately at fighting off any rabies that may be present in your body.The vaccine takes a couple of weeks to develop your immunity, but IgG will protect you during this period.
You will also receive the rabies vaccine on the same day, which is a separate thing. The immunity from the rabies vaccine kicks in within about 2 weeks.You will then receive 3 additional ""follow-up"" rabies vaccines - on day 3 post-exposure, day 7 post-exposure, and day 14 post-exposure, respectively. This is to ensure that it is maximally effective in your system. Because of the high risk and fatality of a rabies infection, it is extremely important that you follow through with all vaccinations scheduled.Both the rabies ""immune globulin"" as well as the rabies vaccine are safe to give to pregnant women and children.;
, Similar to getting a flu shot, the arm muscle where you receive the injection may be sore afterwards, and you may have mild symptoms of fever or generalized muscle aches.This is normal and nothing to worry about.

, If you follow through with the whole treatment regimen for rabies, your chances for ""cure"" are near 100%. The main reasons that rabies becomes dangerous are that either you are in a developing country or a location where vaccination is not available, or you ignore the risk of the animal bite and fail to be treated quickly.As long as you seek treatment immediately after exposure, the risk is very low.

, If you are worried about getting the rabies vaccine, having a friend accompany you to the emergency room can provide an emotional support. Also, if you are nervous around the idea of shots, having someone else to drive you to and from the hospital can help to ensure safety while driving.

, It is important to fully relax your arm before getting the needle put in, as this will minimize the pain. If your muscles are tense, the shot will hurt a lot more. Some strategies to relax include:


Look away from the needle. Some people get very anxious at the sight of a needle that is about to enter their arm. If this is the case for you, it can be helpful to look away and to distract yourself.

Practice deep breathing. Focusing on deep breaths can help your whole body to relax, and also help to minimize any tension that may be present in the muscle receiving the vaccine.
Talk to the person giving you the shot. While looking away, it can also be helpful to distract your mind. One easy way to do this is to make small talk with the nurse giving you the vaccine. It can also help to get your mind off the worry of the pain that is to come. The great thing is that, when your mind is distracted, having a vaccine can be nearly painless!

, If you are someone who is fearful of vaccines, be proud of yourself for following through with the series of rabies vaccines. It is a long process, but one that is extremely important for your health and wellbeing, so be proud of yourself for conquering your fears., Even when you are treated after you have been exposed to rabies, the good news is that if treatment is done quickly enough you will recover just fine.

, In developing countries, dog bites are responsible for 90% of cases of rabies in humans.However, in North America the greatest risk for humans comes from bats. Rabies is also common in raccoons, skunks, and foxes.

, Putting it in context like this can help to ease tension around getting the vaccine, for the benefits far outweigh the hassle or the fear of getting a needle put into you.

Let them fall back against you. Take a stable stance with your knees slightly bent and one foot in front of the other. Take the weight of the person against your body, but do not attempt to hold them up., Remain standing, but allow the person to slide to the floor. If you can, guide the fall away from hard objects (tables, edges of counters) or other obstructions that could injure the person on the way down. Don't try to hold on or hold the person up.,

Support and protect the head. Do what you can to keep the person's head from hitting anything, either on the way down or when they are on the floor., Kneel down next to or behind the person, and do what you can to keep the person calm and comfortable. A pillow or rolled-up shirt will help. If the person is disoriented, discourage them from standing up.,

Call for help. Call emergency services immediately, unless you are certain the person is in no danger. If someone has fallen and you're not sure why, don't hesitate to call and explain the situation, anyway., Tell emergency responders as much as you can about what happened. Mention that you controlled the fall, and say whether you think any injury might have resulted from the fall., At the very least, check that the person is breathing and take appropriate steps to keep their airway clear.

If you think someone has vomited or may vomit as a result of whatever made them fall, ease them onto their side, or, if you need to, use your fingers to clear their airway.

If you have any of the following symptoms and they are severe, call emergency medical services or get to the nearest hospital as soon as possible:Difficulty breathing.
Hoarseness or wheezing.
Swelling around the eyes, lips, or throat.
Hives.
Paleness.
Weakness.
Rapid heartbeat or dizziness.;
, Even if you don’t have symptoms of a severe or life threatening allergic reaction to the flu vaccine, you may still experience serious side effects. These also require medical attention. Call your doctor about how to proceed if you have any of the follow serious side effects:Fever greater than 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).
Hives or swelling at the injection site.
Labored breathing or fast heart rate.
Dizziness that lasts longer than a day or two.Continuous bleeding from the injection site., Medical treatment depends on the type of adverse or serious reaction you have. Your doctor may give you medication or require that you stay at a hospital for monitoring. You may receive one of the following treatments for a serious reaction:Injections of epinephrine for anaphylaxis.
Oral or injected antihistamines for hives and/or itching.
Hospital stay for cardiovascular reactions or loss of consciousness.

, In many cases, bad reactions to the flu vaccine will go away without treatment. However, it’s important to pay attention to any symptoms you may experience following the injection or treatment for an adverse reaction. If your symptoms don’t go away or get worse, contact your doctor or seek prompt medical attention. This can minimize the risk of adverse reactions and serious complications.Contact your doctor if you are unsure of any of your side effects or how you’re feeling. It’s better to be safe than sorry with an adverse reaction.

, Serious reactions to the flu vaccine are uncommon. However, you may still have an adverse reaction to the injection or nasal spray vaccine (The nasal flu vaccine is not currently recommended). Recognizing the common side effects of the flu vaccine can help you figure out the best way to treat them. Adverse reactions include:Soreness, swelling, or redness at the injection site.
Headache.
Low grade fever (below 101 degrees Fahrenheit/ 38 Celsius).
Nausea or vomiting.
Muscle aches.
Cough or sore throat.Runny nose.

, Most side effects from the flu vaccine go away in two days. The most common adverse reactions happen at the injection site. These usually include redness, soreness, or slight swelling. Taking a pain reliever such as ibuprofen can ease any discomfort and decrease swelling.Take an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) such as aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen sodium. These can relieve pain and reduce swelling or inflammation.
Follow dosing instructions as directed on the product packaging or by your doctor.

, You may have itching, soreness, or discomfort at the injection site. You may even experience some lightheadedness or weakness. Putting a cool compress either on the injection site or your face can relieve these adverse reactions to your flu vaccine.Place a cool washcloth or ice pack on the injection site if you have any swelling, discomfort, or redness. Use as often as necessary for 20 minutes at a time until your symptoms go away.Put a cool, damp washcloth on your face or neck if you have any dizziness, lightheadedness, or sweating.Remove the compress if your skin gets too cold or numb., The injection site may bleed a bit following your vaccination. In some cases, it may continue to bleed slightly for a couple of days after the injection. If this happens, put an adhesive compress over the site until it stops bleeding.Contact your doctor if the bleeding doesn’t stop within a day or two or gets worse.

, Some people may get dizzy or even faint with a flu shot. In general, these adverse reactions won’t last longer than a day or two. The best way to treat dizziness and prevent fainting is rest. Having a snack while you rest can boost your blood sugar and help you feel better.Sit or even lie on the floor for a few minutes if you’re feeling dizzy. Loosening any clothing or sitting with your head between your knees may help the dizziness go away.Eat a small snack to boost your blood sugar and help minimize any dizziness you may feel.Aim to eat a healthy snack such as a piece of string cheese, toast with peanut butter, or apple slices.

, Many people experience a low-grade fever (below 101 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) following the flu vaccine. This is a common reaction and usually goes away within one to two days. If the fever bothers you, taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help decrease the your temperature as well as any discomfort you may have from it such as muscle aches.Follow packaging instructions or your doctor’s orders for treating your fever with ibuprofen or acetaminophen.
Contact your doctor right away if your fever doesn’t go away after two days or increases above 101 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.

, Itching at the injection site is also a common adverse reaction to a flu vaccine. In most cases, this will also go away within a day or two. However, you might find the itchiness uncomfortable. You can use an antipruritic, or anti-itch, medication to relieve any itching sensations at the injection site.Apply a hydrocortisone cream every four to six hours to relieve itching. If the itching is severe, your doctor may prescribe oral prednisone or methylprednisolone.
Take an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax) every four to six hours to control injection site itching.

Check that the bandage is not too tight.",How to Attend to a Stab Wound," A stabbing often occurs during a volatile incident and the assailant(s) may still be in the vicinity, which could be dangerous for you and the stabbing victim. Avoid making yourself a potential victim by intervening or going near the assailants. Only approach the victim once you have determined it is safe for you to do so.Although waiting until the assailants have left the scene does entail lost precious time for the stabbing victim, having more people injured is hardly conducive to rescuing anybody.;
, If the person has been stabbed, it is critical to call emergency services as soon as possible.


If you are the only person around, use your phone to call for as first priority assistance. If you don't have a phone with you, try to find a passersby or a nearby shop. You want to help the person as quickly as you can, but the most helpful thing you can do is get professional medical help to the victim as soon as possible.
If the assailants are still nearby and you are unable to safely approach the victim, use that time to call emergency services.

, Before you do anything else to attend to the stab wound, get the person to lie down on the ground.This will make it easier to help stabilize the victim, particularly if he starts to get dizzy or fall unconscious. You don't want the person to risk aggravating the injury or harming himself if he falls while fainting.


For comfort, place a jacket or backpack under the victim's head. Alternatively, if there are other people around, ask one of them to sit with the person's head in her lap and talk to him. This will be soothing to the victim and help him keep calm., Is there more than one stab wound? Are there slashes? Where is the blood coming from? Is it on the front or back of the body?


You will probably have to part the person's clothing to properly identify the wound(s). Try to look for and identify all wounds before starting your treatment.
However, if you notice one obviously severe wound that needs urgent treatment, you should deal with this immediately. A severe wound would be one that is bleeding steadily and profusely or one that it spurting out blood like a geyser. Spurting blood is usually a sign that the wound has hit an artery., Alternatively, you can also put some plastic bags over your hands. Though this step is not required in order to tend to the stab wound, it is important in order to protect yourself reduce the risk of infection to you or the victim.If available, nitrile or other non-latex gloves are preferable. These types of gloves minimize the possibility of an allergic reaction to latex, which can complicate treatment. Nitrile and other non-latex gloves are usually blue or purple and are rapidly replacing the white latex gloves that were previously the standard.If you don't have gloves with you, try to wash your hands or even use a hand sanitizer quickly. If you have nothing available to you, try to use layers of cloth to keep a barrier between yourself and the victim's blood.Remember, you do not have to touch the person if you believe that you are in danger of contracting an infection or are otherwise uncomfortable. Wait for emergency assistance if you are in doubt. If you choose to treat the victim, do your best to minimize contact with the victim's blood.

,
Listen for the sound of breathing and watch the person's chest for movement.
Check the victim's pulse to make sure the heart is still beating.
If the victim has stopped breathing, perform CPR.
If the person is conscious, begin working but also talk with him to keep him calm and help slow his heart rate. If possible, try to keep the victim's eyes averted so he cannot see the wound.

, This will enable you identify the precise location of the stab wound and then apply treatment. Stab wounds can sometimes be obscured by both clothing and blood or other fluids and even dirt or mud, depending on where the victim is found.Use care in removing the victim's clothing since she is likely in considerable pain.

, Leave the object in the wound if it is still there and be very careful not to move it, which may cause further damage. The object is actually helping to stem the blood flow. Pulling it out will likely increase blood loss, while pushing it in may cause further injury to the internal organs.You'll need to apply pressure and dress the wound around the object as best you can. Medical professionals will be better able to remove the object without damaging any internal organs or causing massive blood loss in the process., Apply pressure on the wound with a clean and absorbent material (like a shirt or towel), or preferably, a clean dressing such as sterile gauze. If the object is still in the wound, press firmly around it. Applying pressure to the wound will help to slow the flow of blood.Some first aid training suggests using the edge of a credit card to ""seal"" the wound, an item that's handy because so many people have one on them. Not only does this stem blood flow, but it may also prevent lung collapse (by keeping air out of the wound) if the wound is in the chest.If the wound is bleeding profusely, apply pressure to the major artery leading to the area with your hand, while your other hand continues to apply pressure on the wound. These areas are called ""pressure points"".For example, to slow bleeding in the arm, press the inside of the arm just above the elbow or just below the armpit. If the wound is on the leg, press just behind the knee or in the groin., This will help reduce blood loss. If the victim can sit, get him to move himself into an upright position; if not, then help the victim if possible., If you happen to have first aid materials with you, fasten the dressing in place using a bandage or tape. Do not lift or remove the dressing as this will disrupt clot formation and re-start the bleeding. If the dressing becomes soaked with blood, add more cloth material on top of it.If you don't have any materials to fasten the dressing in place, simply continue to apply pressure. This will help the blood clot.
For a chest wound, be careful. Cover the wound with something like kitchen foil, a plastic bag or cling-film and only cover three sides of the wound and leave one un-taped or bandaged down. Air needs to be able to escape from one side of the bandage to prevent it from entering the pleural cavity in the chest. If air enters the pleural cavity, the lungs can collapse.
Never use a tourniquet except as the last resort to save a life.Know how and when to use a tourniquet. If a tourniquet is applied incorrectly, it may lead to an unnecessary serious injury to or loss of the affected limb.

, While waiting for emergency help, continue to monitor the ABCs: airway, breathing, and circulation.Look for and treat symptoms of shock. Symptoms of shock include cool, clammy skin, paleness, rapid pulse or breathing, nausea or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, and increased anxiety or agitation. If you suspect the victim may be in shock, loosen any tight clothing and cover her with a blanket to warm her. Try to get the victim to stay still. See How to treat shock for details., If the victim falls unconscious, you'll need to act quickly. Place the victim in the recovery position, on his side with the head tilted back and the hand further away from the ground under the head and the arm closest to the ground either bent or straight out. The leg further away from the ground (the top leg) should be bent for stability and to keep the victim from rolling forward. Do not put someone in the recovery position if you suspect he has a spinal or neck injury. Monitor the person's breathing.If the unconscious victim stops breathing, place the victim on his back and perform CPR.

, Both shock and loss of blood can cause the victim to suffer from lowered body temperature. Throw a blanket, coat, or some other warm item over the victim to keep her warm.Keep the victim as still as possible. Whether lying or sitting down, the person should be kept still and calm. It is important that someone remains with the person constantly to both reassure her and to monitor her condition., If you are isolated and not able to call emergency services (e.g., if you are camping or in the wilderness), you should clean the wound once you have some control over the bleeding. In normal circumstances, this would be the job of emergency personnel, but there may be times when you need to do this yourself.


Remove any debris from the wound if present. Keep in mind, however, that even a wound without debris has had an object jabbed in it and there's no way of knowing how clean that item was. In other words, every wound should be cleaned properly.
Saline is the best to irrigate the wound. Fresh, clean water is best if there is no saline on-hand.You can also make a salt solution. Mix of 1 tablespoon of salt to 1 cup of warm water.The victim will likely experience pain when the wound is being cleaned so if the person is conscious, give him warning.

, A dirty wound should not be closed, and any stabbing is considered dirty. Packing the wound should help to avoid any contamination from outside materials, like dirt, which could cause an infection. Stab wounds should be packed with saline and gauze and cover with tape relatively loosely. In this case, you are covering the wound, not binding it, as you wait for it to clot.If you have some medical training or you are certain the wound is clean, you may wish to close the wound. Make sure the wound is dry first. If you have some glue, apply it to the edges of skin around the wound (not on the wound). Apply a strip of tape to one edge of the wound, close the skin gap with your hand, and apply the other side of the tape. Cover the wound with clean cloth, duct tape, or whatever else you have on hand that can keep dirt and other infectious materials out of the wound.The wound should be repacked daily.
If a wound will not cease bleeding, do NOT close it., If you have any antibiotic ointments, apply periodically to the wound. This will also help avoid any infection from setting in., Check the area furthest away from the heart for each limb that has a bandage on it. For example, if the person has an arm wound, examine his fingers. If the person has a leg wound, check his toes. If a bandage is too tight, it may cut off blood flow to the area below it, which is dangerous and can permanently damage the tissue. You can tell if this is happening because these areas will become discolored (blue or dark-colored). Loosen the bandage if you notice this happening and see emergency assistance as soon as possible."
"
Don't think about the shot.,
Bring someone else for moral support.,
Know that it won't hurt for long.,
Take deep breaths.,
Take precautionary measures if necessary.,
Don't look at the bag of needles.,
Relax your muscles and don't look.,
Take care of yourself after the shot.",How to Relax While Getting a Shot," If you worry about it too much in the week or so before you get the shot, when it actually comes you'll be even more scared. In order to avoid this, try not to think about the shot in the time leading up to it. Distract yourself with friends, games, or even homework - do anything rather than think about the shot.


If your parents made the doctor's appointment for you, ask them not to tell you about it - when the appointment is or whether you'll be getting a shot. This way, you won't be able to worry about it that far in advance.;
,  This can be a parent, sibling, other relative, or friend. Ask them to talk to you about other things and distract you throughout the appointment and especially just before the shot. Squeeze their hand if it helps you release your anxiety. Having someone you're close to will help you feel better and relax throughout the experience, but make sure to choose someone who will help you relax, rather than making fun of you or stressing you out.

, There will be a sharp pain for less than three seconds, and then it will be over. It may be slightly sore for a few days, but it won't hurt much. Realize that it's only a small amount of pain for a huge benefit, so it will be worth it. Expect and accept a small amount of pain, and you will get through the shot much more easily.

, Breathe in and out, focusing on drawing the air all the way into your body and then pushing it all the way out. Count your breaths if that helps you relax and focus on your breathing. This will help calm your body down so that you will feel less nervous and stressed.

, If you've fainted during or after shots before, or if you're worried about fainting, tell the doctor. They may have you lie down on the table or sit in a comfortable chair while they administer the shot, and they can keep an eye on you for a few minutes after the shot to make sure you're okay. Make sure they know that you're nervous so that they can help calm you down or take any necessary precautionary measures to keep you safe in any situation. 

, Before giving the shot, the doctor will clean the area where you're getting the shot with some alcohol. This is the scariest part because you know you're getting it soon.  If you look at the bag of needles they will look super sharp and menacing, so turn your head away. Focus instead on your friend or family member that you brought with you, and talk to them to avoid looking at or thinking about the upcoming shot.

, Look at your parent or friend, read a poster on the wall, or just look straight in front of you, but don't look at the needle and don't watch the doctor administer the shot if you're at all nervous about it. Clenching your muscles can make the shot hurt more and can cause a much stronger relief reaction just after the shot, so avoid this by making sure to relax your muscles. 

, Move your arm around throughout the day to keep it from being sore. Keep an eye on it the next couple of days to make sure everything is going as planned, and call your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.

A person cannot get TB from touching people, shaking hands, or touching bed linens or toilet seats.
A person cannot get TB by sharing food or drink, sharing toothbrushes, or kissing. (However, s/he can become infected with other communicable diseases by doing these things.);
, It is possible to be infected with TB bacteria and not get sick. The TB skin test cannot tell the difference between latent TB infection or TB disease.If the person has latent TB infection, s/he is infected with the TB bacteria but his/her body is able to fight it off. S/he will not experience any symptoms and will not feel sick. S/he will not be infectious and cannot spread TB to others. A skin test will indicate TB infection.
However, if the patient’s body stops being able to fight off the bacteria, s/he can become ill with TB disease. S/he may become ill shortly after being infected, or s/he might feel fine for years until his/her immune system is weakened by something else.

TB disease occurs when a patient’s body cannot keep the TB bacteria from multiplying. S/he will feel sick and experience symptoms. People with TB disease are infectious and can spread the bacteria to others. A skin test will indicate TB infection.

, To determine whether a patient has been exposed to the TB bacteria, you should know how to recognize the symptoms of TB disease.These include:


A bad cough lasting 3 weeks or longer
Chest pain
Coughing up blood or bloody sputum (mucus)
Fatigue or weakness
Weight loss
Loss of appetite
Chills or fever
Night sweats

, Before administering the test, gather all of the necessary supplies, including:A vial of tuberculin (tuberculin should always be stored in a refrigerator)
Latex gloves
Small disposable tuberculin syringe, 1.2 cc or smaller, with a needle 25 g or smaller
Alcohol swab
Cotton ball
Ruler with millimeter measurements
Sharps disposable container
Patient’s paperwork

, Before attempting to administer the tuberculin, verify that it’s safe and appropriate to use.The expiration date should be printed on the label. It will indicate when an unopened vial should no longer be used. If the expiration date has passed, don’t use the vial.
Check the date the vial was opened. The label should also specify a beyond-use date indicating how long after its initial opening a vial can still be used. If the beyond-use date has passed, don’t use the vial. Your local health department will be able to let you know the exact number of days after a multidose vial is opened before you must discard it.
The manufacturer’s guidelines should state whether the vial is single or multidose. A multidose vial includes a preservative that allows you to administer it to more than one patient.

, You will need a firm surface for the patient to rest his/her arm on. The area should be well-lit and clean., Wash with warm water and soap, scrubbing liberally for 20 seconds.Rinse your hands with a paper towel and put on a pair of latex gloves.

, Explain what the skin test does and how long it will take. You should tell the patient what each step of the procedure will be like. After you have explained the procedure, ask whether the patient has any questions for you.Tell the patient that you will be injecting a very small amount of fluid into his or her arm. If infection is present, the injection site will show a reaction, such as swelling or a raised, hard area.Explain that the patient must return to your office after 48-72 hours to have the test site examined.
If the patient cannot return after 48-72 hours, do not administer the test. Make another appointment.

, The left arm is the standard choice, though the right arm is acceptable if you can’t use the left.Be sure the patient’s arm is on a firm, well-lit surface.
Slightly flex the arm at the elbow and position the hand palm side up.
Look for a place below the elbow clear of elements that could interfere with the test reading, like hair, scars, veins, or tattoos.

, Be sure to wipe vigorously.


Allow the alcohol to dry.

, To fasten the needle to the syringe, twist the cap into the tip of the syringe.


Place the vial on a flat surface, then insert the needle into the stopper.
Draw the solution. Pull back on the plunger and draw out slightly more than one-tenth (0.1) of a milliliter of solution.
Remove the needle from the vial. Make sure there are no bubbles in the syringe. If there are bubbles, expel the bubbles by slightly pushing the plunger up while pointing the needle of the syringe towards the ceiling.

, Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. Circle the alcohol swab outward from the center of the site.Allow to dry.
Stretch the skin at the injection site taut between your thumb and forefinger. Hold the syringe flange parallel to the forearm with the needle bevel facing upwards. Still holding the skin taut, insert the needle slowly into the injection site at a 5-15 degree angle.

, After inserting the needle, advance it approximately 3 millimeters. The needle tip should be intra dermal (below the epidermis but in the dermis).


Let the skin go and hold the syringe steady. Depress the plunger to inject the solution intradermally, just below the superficial layer of skin.
A tense, pale raised area about 6-10 millimeters will immediately appear over the needle bevel.

, Be careful to remove without pressing or massaging the patient’s arm.Do not recap the needle; you’ll risk sticking yourself.
Discard the needle immediately in a sharps container.
If a drop of blood appears on the patient’s arm, blot it lightly with a cotton ball or gauze pad. Don’t cover the site with a bandage because it could interfere with the test.Return the tuberculin solution to the refrigerator or a cooling container., Measure the raised skin at the injection site; it should be at least 6 millimeters in diameter.If the raised area is smaller than 6 millimeters, it indicates that either the needle was inserted too deeply or the dose was inadequate. You should repeat the test.
You may also need to repeat the test if the patient doesn’t return 48-72 hours after the injection to complete the test.If you need to repeat the test, choose another site at least 2 inches away from the original site., Instruct the patient to have the test read 48-72 hours later.


Verify the appointment for the test reading.
The test must be read by a trained healthcare provider. The patient cannot read the test on his or her own.

, The patient can anticipate symptoms including itching, swelling, or irritation at the site that should go away within a week.Remind the patient to come back if a more severe reaction occurs.


Instruct the patient to avoid scratching the site, covering it with a bandage, or applying any itching creams.
Instruct the person to also avoid scrubbing the area, though showering is okay.

, Elevate your arm so that when you bend your elbow, your elbow is parallel to your heart. This ensures that you will not get either an overestimated or underestimated reading on your blood pressure. It is also important that your arm is supported during the reading, so make sure to rest your elbow on a stable surface.

, Most cuffs have Velcro, making it easy to secure the cuff in place. If your shirt has long or thick sleeves, roll them up first, as you can only put the cuff over very thin clothing. The bottom edge of the cuff should be about an inch above the elbow.Some experts recommend you use your left arm; others suggest you test both arms. But while you're first adjusting to self-testing, use the left arm if you're right-handed, or vice versa.

, If the cuff is too loose, the cuff will not compress the artery correctly, giving you an inaccurately low blood pressure reading. If the cuff is too tight, it will create what is known as ""cuff hypertension"" and give you an inaccurately high reading.Cuff hypertension can also occur if the cuff is too narrow or too short relative to your arm.

, The head of the stethoscope (also known as the diaphragm) should be placed flat against the skin on the inside of your arm. The edge of the diaphragm should be just beneath the cuff, positioned over the brachial artery. Gently put the earpieces of the stethoscope in your ears.


Do not hold the head of the stethoscope with your thumb — your thumb has its own pulse and this will confuse you while you try to obtain a reading.
A good method is to hold the head of the stethoscope in place with your index and middle fingers. This way, you should not hear a thumping sound until you have begun to inflate the cuff.

, If the pressure gauge is clipped to the cuff, unclip it and attach it to something sturdy instead, such as a hardcover book. That way, you can place it in front of you on the table, making it easier to watch. It's important to keep the gauge anchored and stable.


Make sure there is adequate light and you can see the needle and pressure markings well before you begin to test.
Sometimes the gauge is attached to the rubber bulb, in which case this step does not apply.

, The valve needs to be closed completely before you start. This will ensure that no air escapes as you pump, which would produce an inaccurate reading. Twist the valve clockwise, until you feel it stop.


It is also important to avoid over-tightening the valve, otherwise you will open it too far and release the air too quickly.

, Rapidly pump the bulb to inflate the cuff. Keep pumping until the needle on the gauge reaches 180mmHg. The pressure from the cuff will occlude a large artery in the bicep, temporarily cutting off blood flow. This is why the pressure from the cuff can feel a little uncomfortable or strange.

, Gently turn the valve on the bulb counter-clockwise, so that the air in the cuff is released steadily, but at a slow pace. Keep an eye on the gauge; for best accuracy, the needle should be moving downwards at a rate of 3mm per second.Releasing the valve while you hold the stethoscope can be a little tricky. Try releasing the valve with the hand on your cuff arm, while holding the stethoscope with your free arm.
If there is someone nearby, ask him to assist you. An additional pair of hands can make the process much easier.

, As the pressure drops, use the stethoscope to listen for a thumping or knocking sound. When you hear the first thump, make a note of the pressure on the gauge. This is your systolic blood pressure.


The systolic number represents the pressure your blood flow exerts on the walls of an artery after the heart beats or contracts. It is the higher number of the two blood pressure readings, and when blood pressure is written down, it appears at the top.The clinical name for the thumping sounds your hear is ""Korotkoff sounds.""

, Keep watching the gauge, while using the stethoscope to listen to the thumping noises. Eventually the hard thumping noises will turn into a ""whooshing"" sound. It is helpful to note this change, as it indicates that you are close to your diastolic blood pressure. As soon as the whooshing noise subsides, and you hear only silence, make a note of the pressure on the gauge. This is your diastolic blood pressure.


The diastolic number represents the pressure your blood flow exerts on the walls of an artery when your heart relaxes between contractions. It is the lower number of the two blood pressure readings, and when blood pressure is written down, it appears at the bottom.

, If you miss the exact measure of either number, it's perfectly acceptable to pump the cuff back up a little to catch it.


Just don't do it too much (more than twice) as this can affect accuracy.
Alternatively, you can switch the cuff to the other arm and repeat the process again.

, Blood pressure fluctuates within minutes (sometimes dramatically) so if you take two readings within about a ten-minute period, you can come up with a more accurate average number.


For the most accurate results, check your blood pressure a second time, five to ten minutes after the first go.
It may also be a good idea to use your other arm for the second reading, especially if your first reading was abnormal.

, Once you have recorded your blood pressure, it is important to know what the numbers mean. Use the following guide for reference:



Normal blood pressure: Systolic number of less than 120 and diastolic number of less than 80.

Prehypertension: Systolic number between 120 and 139, diastolic number between 80 and 89.

Stage 1 Hypertension: Systolic number between 140 and 159, diastolic number between 90 and 99.

Stage 2 Hypertension: Systolic number higher than 160 and diastolic number higher than 100.

Hypertensive Crisis: Systolic number higher than 180 and diastolic number higher than 110., Even if your blood pressure readings are far below the 120/80 ""normal"" mark, there is usually no cause for concern. A low blood pressure reading of, say, 85/55 mmHg is still considered to be acceptable, as long as no symptoms of low blood pressure are present.


However, if you are experiencing symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, trouble concentrating, cold and clammy skin, fast and shallow breathing, dehydration, nausea, blurred vision and/or fatigue, it is advisable that you see a doctor right away, as your low blood pressure may be the result of an underlying condition, which could be serious or cause serious complications.., It's important to understand that a single high reading does not necessarily mean that you have high blood pressure. It could be the result of many factors.


If you take your blood pressure after exercising, after eating salty foods, drinking coffee, smoking, or during a period of high stress, your blood pressure might be uncharacteristically high. If the blood pressure cuff was too loose or too tight on your arm or too large or too small for your size, the readings could be inaccurate. As a result, you shouldn't worry too much about one-off readings, especially if your blood pressure is back to normal the next time you check it.
However, if your blood pressure is consistently at or higher than 140/90 mm Hg, you may want to consult with a doctor who can put you on a treatment plan, which usually involves a combination of healthy eating and exercise.
Medications may also be considered if lifestyle changes don't help, your blood pressure is very high, or you have risk factors such as diabetes or heart disease.
If you get a systolic reading of 180 or higher, or a diastolic reading of 110 or higher, wait a few minutes then check your blood pressure again. If it is still at that level, you need to contact emergency medical services immediately, as you may be suffering from a hypertensive crisis."

Ask about rescheduling when your child is sick.",How to Safely Vaccinate Your Child," Your child's pediatrician is required to provide you with information on the vaccines your child is receiving. These pamphlets lay out in detail how vaccinations help your child, as well as any risks vaccinations pose to your child.Keep in mind that vaccines do not cause autism.This is a myth that has been disproven many times, and the person who originally fabricated this claim had his medical license revoked due to skewing data.;
, If you are concerned about the safety of vaccinations, it's a good idea to talk to your child's doctor before your child is vaccinated. Your child's pediatrician can explain what each vaccine will do and how they can help your child, as well as any risks to your child., Vaccinations introduce a weakened or partial form of certain viruses and bacteria to the body. They don't actually make a person sick, but they teach the body to fight off these invaders that make your child sick.Taking a vaccination is much safer than getting the actual disease, as many of the diseases that are vaccinated against can lead to disabilities and even death.

, Vaccinations help keep your child healthy, which means fewer sick days. Plus, it's important for those who can get vaccinated to do so, as some children are not able to get vaccinations. Having as many kids as possible get vaccinations helps protect the more vulnerable kids and adults, as diseases are not able to spread as readily.Vaccines help prevent many diseases from the past, such as polio or diphtheria, but they also prevent or reduce diseases that are still very much around. These include chickenpox, measles, whooping cough, influenza, meningitis, pneumonia, and even ear infections.

, Vaccinating on schedule is important. Doing vaccinations on a schedule helps to keep your child protected from serious diseases. If you miss vaccinations or don't do them when you should, you leave your child vulnerable to these diseases.In the first year of life or so, your child will need about 4 sets of vaccinations. The vaccinations will include hepatitis B, rotavirus, DTaP, haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcal conjugate, polio, flu, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, hepatitis A, and meningococcal. However, your child won't get all of these doses every time they go in, only some of them. Some people worry that this is too much for a child's body, but children are exposed to thousands of bacteria and viruses during childhood and can safely deal with the amount of vaccines required.
Your child will need an annual vaccination (for the flu), as well a set each at 18 months, 4 to 6 years, and 11 to 12 years.
Talk to your child's doctor about the best schedule for your child., You don't need to spread out vaccinations. Rather, vaccinations are easiest done in groups. You don't have to visit the doctor as often with your child, which means less trauma. Plus, your child's body is able to handle multiple vaccinations at once., While vaccines are generally safe, it's a good idea to pay close attention to your child after they get a vaccine. Mild side effects include a light fever and pain or mild redness or swelling at the injection site, and these side effects are usually not cause for concern. More severe side effects are very rare.Watch for allergic reactions, such as hives or redness that is severe or is on a large area of the skin.
Also look for things like blood in the urine, seizures, or very high fevers (over 105 degrees Fahrenheit or about 40.5 Celsius).
Also, watch for things like vomiting or extreme tiredness.

, If your child has a bad reaction, you should take them to the emergency room or call your doctor, depending on the severity. However, you should also report reactions to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which is in place to monitor reactions.You can call 1-800-822-7967 or go to the website at http://www.vaers.hhs.gov to report the reaction.

, It's important to keep track of your child's vaccination history. For one, if you move, you may need it to show a new doctor. Also, most schools require proof of vaccinations before kids can enter, so it's good to have proof on hand.Make sure you hold on to any papers your doctor gives you about your child's vaccination. It can also help to keep your own written document of the dates your child received vaccinations. Most doctors' offices and health departments keep electronic records of vaccines, but it is still important for you to have a written copy.

, If your child has an allergy, including food allergies, it's important to talk to your child's pediatrician before your child is vaccinated. For instance, if your child has an egg allergy, they may need a certain form of the flu vaccine, as many of these vaccines are grown in eggs. Similarly, a latex allergy is important to note, as many vaccines are packaged in latex., If your child has had a reaction to a vaccine in the past, it's important to remind your child's pediatrician of that if your child is scheduled for more vaccinations. Depending on the reaction, your doctor may choose to not give certain vaccinations to your child., It's important to discuss any chronic illnesses your child has with their pediatrician along with any medications they take. Certain diseases or medications may make your child a poor candidate for certain vaccines. It's especially important to bring up these diseases if your child has a new doctor.For example, conditions such as cancer or a compromised immune system may make your child a poor candidate for getting certain vaccines.

, Often, your child can still have their vaccinations when they are sick. However, that is a conversation you need to have with your child's doctor, as some vaccines may be better off rescheduled. If your child is sick the day before or the day off their appointment, call in to see what the best option is.For instance, if you child has a mild fever, a cold, or an ear infection, it's usually still fine to get vaccinations."

Learn what acidophilus is and what it's used for.,
Talk to your doctor about using acidophilus.,
Be prepared for mild side effects.The lactose intolerant may react to acidophilus because the manufacturing process can leave small amounts of lactose in the final product.,
Buy acidophilus from a reputable supplier.,
Look for independent quality guarantees.,
Check the packaging for a CFU count guarantee.Each acidophilus supplement should come with a CFU (Colony Forming Units) count guarantee, which is based on the count at the time of manufacturing.,
Ensure the acidophilus is correctly handled.,
Check the ingredients in the acidophilus supplement.,
Consider a variety of acidophilus supplements.,
Take acidophilus capsules.,
Chew acidophilus tablets.Chewable acidophilus tablets are a good alternative for children and adults who have difficulty swallowing pills.,
Mix acidophilus powder into your food.Acidophilus powder is available in large bottles through health food stores and online vitamin suppliers.,
Drink acidophilus milk.Acidophilus milk is available through health food stores and some grocery stores.,
Ingest acidophilus through foods.Yogurt and soy products contain natural forms of acidophilus.",How to Buy Acidophilus," This naturally occurring ""good bacteria"" helps to break down food in your colon and protect against “bad bacteria.” Though you can ingest it through food, you can't get adequate amounts that way. For the best results, you should take a supplement as well to help with various GI issues and other conditions. Though there are many types, Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most commonly used probiotic.It's used to treat many different conditions, including:Traveler’s diarrhea
Antibiotic associated diarrhea
Irritable bowel syndrome
Inflammatory bowel disease
Vaginal infections
Research is currently being conducted to see if probiotics are effective in treating lactose intolerance and helping the immune system.;
, If you're using acidophilus as a general dietary supplement, you should take 1 to 4 billion CFU (colony forming units) per day.The packaging of reliable suppliers will let you know the strength of the probiotic supplements you buy. However, your doctor may prescribe smaller or larger doses if acidophilus is being used to treat a specific condition — yeast infections, for example.When using to treat a specific condition, follow your doctor's recommended dosage rather than general dosage recommendations.


Acidophilus can be problematic if you have a pre-existing gastro-intestinal condition, like short bowel syndrome.Discuss your options with your doctor.
Be careful about using it with children or infants, as bacteria can get into the blood, causing sepsis. It can also cause diarrhea and dehydration, or raise the child's likelihood of developing lactose intolerance.

, However, the most common side effect is bloating and gas, though it usually tapers off with continued use.


Be aware that antibiotics can kill off the acidophilus bacteria, rendering it ineffective. Talk to your doctor about your antibiotic use. To be safe, it's best to give yourself at least a 2 hour window before and after taking an antibiotic.
In rare cases, it can cause arthritis, arterial blockage, diarrhea, esophageal disease, heart, liver, or skin problems, or vaginal discomfort.
Some people are just allergic to the bacteria itself. If you suffer an allergic reaction, avoid all products from the Lactobacillaceae family of bacteria.

, Because probiotics are considered dietary supplements, the FDA does not have to approve these products. They do, however, loosely regulate them. There are standards for the manufacturing of dietary supplements, and the FDA may periodically check the facilities.Still, there's a chance that your dietary supplement is contaminated or does not actually contain what it claims to.It's important to buy probiotic supplements from a reputable supplier who guarantees its products.


Keep cold supplements cold. Remember that if a supplement is meant to be refrigerated, then it must stay that way. Millions of probiotics die when the supplement is left at room temperature.

, A reputable manufacturer will allow an independent organization like U.S. Pharmacopeia, NSF international or Consumerlab.com to test their product. These seals of approval do not necessarily guarantee safety or effectiveness. However, they do ensure that the products actually contain what they claims to, and that they're not contaminated., Most acidophilus supplements contain between 1 to 2 billion CFU. Do not purchase products without CFU count guarantees.

, Acidophilus supplements contain live bacteria, so they should be stored and transported in cool conditions. The ideal temperature is below 40 degrees F (4.5 degrees C).This may be hard to verify, but it is important information to consider.


If the label doesn't require you to refrigerate the product, you probably don't have a good product on your hands. Real acidophilus supplements need refrigeration.
Also check the label for an expiration date. Reputable stores generally pull all expired products from stock.

, Some supplement manufacturers water down their product by mixing slow-growing acidophilus with other fast-growing bacteria. This increases the CFU count and makes it appear like a more effective product to consumers. Examples of fast-growing bacteria additions include other strains of Lactobacillus and Bacillus coagulants.Although these may have some research behind them, most studies use Lactobacillus acidophilus.


For best results, look for an acidophilus supplement that contains only acidophilus.
The probiotic may be listed as acidophilus, lactobacillus or l. acidophilus.

, Acidophilus is naturally produced in the body, and is normally found in the mouth, small intestine, and vagina.However, you can supplement natural probiotic production with a variety of products — you don't have to restrict yourself to a single form! Lactobacillus supplements are available as pills, powders, or enriched foods at most health food stores, pharmacies or online vitamin distributors., Capsules are the most popular way to take acidophilus because you can swallow the pills with water. The general recommended dosage is 1 to 2 capsules taken once a day. The capsules usually have a strength of 1 to 2 billion CFU, so you should get 1 to 4 billion CFU per day. , Just like the capsules, you need to get 1 to 4 billion CFU per day through 1 to 2 tablets.


Some suppliers offer acidophilus tablets that taste like strawberry or other flavors.
Don't give these supplements to children under 3 years unless directed to by your doctor.

, The powder can be mixed with juice or water, or sprinkled over food. It has a slightly sweet and chalky taste. About 1/4 tsp. (1.23 ml) of the powder is equal to 2 capsules or tablets.


Be aware that every time you open the container, the powder is exposed to contamination and humidity, which can cause it to deteriorate.
As opposed to tablets or capsules, you are in charge of measuring the correct dosage with powders. Measure carefully!, The milk has a tangy taste and a slightly thicker consistency than cow's milk. Unlike the advertised CFU strength in tablets, capsules and powders, the amount of the supplement in the milk usually isn't verified. It can be hard to know how much acidophilus you're actually drinking.

, When choosing yogurt for its probiotic value, look for yogurt that contains live l. acidophilus cultures and no added sugars. Some fresh fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, also contain acidophilus. However, the amount of probiotics in food sources do not meet the recommended dosages for acidophilus supplements. Therefore, while yogurt, soy products and fresh produce are helpful in increasing probiotic intake, they are not a substitute for an acidophilus supplement.


Although food sources are great, a supplement is the only true way to consume enough of this. It is a great idea to do both of these methods!

Look at the condition of the person’s skin.,
Examine the person's chest.,
Palpate the 4 quadrants of the person’s abdomen: upper left and upper right (including the shoulders and ribs, down to their waist) and lower left and lower right (including the lower ribs and stomach).,
Examine the pelvis.,
Assess the person’s capillary refill by pressing on their fingernail.,
Exam the bones of the arms and legs to check for breakage.",How to Conduct a Head‐to‐Toe Exam During First Aid," This is a useful way to remember the five steps for a primary first-aid survey. A primary survey should be performed as soon as you encounter an injured person, in order to determine if they are suffering from any life-threatening conditions.The five letters stand for:


Danger
Response
Airway
Breathing
Circulation;
, If so, either make the situation safe, or do not help them.


This guidance may seem cold-hearted. However, the reality of the situation is that it’s useless to attempt to help an injured person if you are only going to injure yourself in the process.
For example, if the victim is in a precarious place or in a situation with a dangerous animal, you should first take steps to make the situation more safe before you conduct a head to toe exam.

, Verify the injured person’s level of consciousness and orientation. First, note if he is awake and alert by verifying that his eyes are open and focused.Ask the individual to tell you his name, where he is at, what the date is and what he was doing before he was injured.
If he can answer you properly, he is conscious. If not, there is possibility he has suffered some cognitive damage.

, If the victim is conscious and indicating that they are choking (hands around the neck, gasping for breath, etc.), their airway is probably obstructed. Clear the airway by inserting your pointer and middle finger into the victim’s mouth, and use a “sweeping” motion to clear the back of their throat. Common signs of choking in a victim are:


Clasping hands around his neck.
Struggling to breathe.
It is useless—and potentially harmful—to administer mouth-to-mouth breathing (also known as “rescue breathing”) if the victim’s airway is blocked.

, Put your hand or cheek next to their mouth and nose in order to feel their breath; you should also watch the rise and fall of their chest. You may need to put a hand on their upper chest to feel their breathing if their breaths are shallow.


If the victim is struggling to breathe but their airway is not obstructed, tilt their head back and lift their chin. This will open the airway as much as possible.
If the victim is not breathing at all, begin giving him cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

, If the victim is visibly bleeding, try to stop the flow of blood by applying firm pressure with a piece of cloth (a sleeve torn off of your shirt, for example).Once you have stopped the flow of blood, you should treat the victim for shock. Have them lie down in a safe place, then cover them with a blanket (or jacket) and elevate their feet about 4 inches.
This will cause blood to flow to their head and reduce the symptoms of shock.

, Find out, in their words, what happened that caused the individual to be hurt or to feel unwell.If the victim was hurt within view of others, ask witnesses to describe what happened.
Use context clues to determine what injuries the victim could have sustained. For example, if the victim fell while rock climbing, fractured bones are likely.

, This should include events that have before this particular incident.Once emergency responders (usually EMTs or ambulance crews) arrive on the scene, be prepared to hand over your notes to them, or to verbally describe the victim’s medical history. Ask specific questions; try asking:


“Do you have any relevant allergies?”
“Do you take any prescribed medications?”
“Do you have any existing medical conditions that would effect this incident?”
“When was the last time that you ate a meal? What did you eat?”

, Often injured victims will have symptoms that are not found by a simple first-aid exam. Consequently, it is valuable to hear from the victim himself what hurts or what has been injured.


Ask specific questions: where does the victim feel pain? At what point did the pain start?

, Once you have determined that the hurt individual is not in immediate danger, can breathe, and has circulation, you can proceed with a more nuanced secondary survey: a detailed head-to-toe examination.This will help you confirm that there are no smaller, lingering injuries or problems.


Unless you have medical qualifications, you should note and record this information in order to pass it on to medical personnel when they arrive.
The information you track in a Secondary survey will probably not reveal any immediately life-threatening problems. However, your observations could still provide emergency personnel with valuable information that will aid the victim’s recovery.

, This will prevent the spread of disease through contact with body fluids such as blood, urine, or vomit.


If the body fluids of an infected individual enter through a break in your skin, there is a possibility of contracting a disease, so barrier protection is critical.
You should use nitrile or latex gloves, which will protect your hands from touching blood and feces. However, if you or the victim has a latex allergy, opt for nitrile.
There are also vinyl gloves, which can be included in first aid kits and also will protect you from blood and feces. They are not as robust as the other types of gloves and tear more easily, but feel free to use them, especially if your victim has no open wounds or exposed body fluids.
You can also improvise gloves with plastic bags, dish gloves, or leather work gloves., Abnormalities in this region can be a sign of damage to the skull, or swelling in the brain. If you notice active bleeding in any locations on the head, apply pressure to area to stop the blood flow. As you inspect the victim’s head:


Whisper in his ear to check for hearing loss.
Check his nose for any breaks or drainage.
Observe the patient’s mouth for cuts, broken teeth, and blood.
Prepare to relay all of this information to the EMTs or ambulance personnel.

, Check for cuts, scrapes, redness, bruising and irritation, as these can be signs of physical trauma.


If the victim is bleeding, apply direct pressure to the wound, using a clean piece of cloth. If the cloth gets soaked with blood, do not remove it. Instead, apply another cloth on top of it.
Take note of the color and temperature of his skin, as it may be abnormally hot or cold.

, Look for any obvious cuts or bruises. Then, watch the person breathing to see if any part of the chest looks out of line or is moving differently than the rest of the chest. Divide the chest into four quadrants, and place your hand lightly on each section of the chest to watch for pain and unusual movement.Listen for a strong heartbeat and any abnormal sounds such as wheezing, as these may be signs of inner damage. Report any abnormal sounds to the emergency personnel.

, You are checking for tenderness, swelling, and lumps.


Place your head close to the abdomen and listen for any abnormal sounds, such as gurgling.

, If the person is uncomfortable with you touching them in that area, do not continue with the exam. However, if they do not mind, put one of your hands on each side of the pelvis, and gently compress the pelvis together. If the person feels pain, stop here. If they do not, gently rock the hips from side to side and look for unusual movement.If the victim complains of pain, or you notice abnormal signs, pass this information on to the emergency personnel.

, The fingernail will turn white when pressed and will immediately turn pink again if proper circulation is present. If the fingernail takes longer to regain its pink color, the individual may have a problem with their circulation.Check the pulse at the wrist: make sure that the pulse is present and regular. If the victim’s pulse feels weak or beats irregularly or slowly, pass this information to the emergency personnel.

, Place a hand on each side of the limb and press inward, checking for flexing of the bone.


Ask the person if they feel any pain when pressing.
Do not press on areas where there is obvious protrusion of the bone, as it can do more damage.

Locating an Injection Site: Choose one of the eight injection sites that your doctor reviewed with you.,
Wash Your Hands Thoroughly: Use soap and water.,
Open the Betaseron Package: Remove the Betaseron vial.,
Open the Vial Adapter: Remove the prep pad from the vial and gently push the adapter onto the vial until you hear a clicking sound.,
Connect the Syringe with the Yellow Line to the Vial Adapter: Turn it counter-clockwise slowly until it stops turning.,
Slowly Push the Syringe's Plunger All the Way In: This will transfer all the diluent into the vial.,
Once You Start to Swirl the Vial: You want to make sure you have completely dissolved the white cake of Betaseron.,
Once the White Cake is Dissolved: Look closely at the solution to make sure it is clear, colorless, and free of any visible particles.

,
Turn the Syringe Over Until the Vial is On Top: Hold the syringe in your hand with your thumb on top of the vial.,
Remove the Vial by Turning Clockwise: Set the vial aside.

,
Pick Your Injection Site: Use the other alcohol prep pad to clean the injection site you have previously selected.

,
Inject Betaseron at the Injection Site: Hold the syringe like a dart in one hand.,
Remove the Needle from the Skin: Place a dry cotton ball or gauze pad over the injection site.,
Clean Up: Dispose of the syringe safely by placing it in a sharps container.",How to Prepare and Take an Betaseron Injection,";
, Work soap into lather by rubbing hands together for 20 seconds. Rinse and dry your hands.

, Remove the cover from the vial and open one of the alcohol prep pads, included in your kit, and clean the op of he Betaseron vial. Leave the prep pad on top of the vial until you are ready to connect it to the syringe.

,


The adapter is sterile, so leave it in the package until you are ready to connect the syringe.

,


Important: Do not over tighten the vial to the syringe.

, Continue to hold the plunger in as you slowly swirl the vial from side to side.


Remember: If you let go of the plunger it may pull solution back into the syringe.

,


Do not shake it in this process, shaking the vial can cause the Betaseron solution to foam. If you get a foam in the vial, let it sit until it settles.

,, Slowly pull the syringe's plunger back to fill it with the prescribed amount of Betaseron solution.


Important: Make sure you flick out any air bubbles trapped inside the syringe. Failure to do so will result in death or serious injury.

,,, Then gently pinch the skin around the injection site with the thumb and forefinger of your other hand. Stick the needle straight into the skin at a 90 degree angle with a quick and firm motion. Once in your skin, slowly pull back on the plunger.


Important: If blood appears in the syringe it means you have entered a blood vessel. Do not inject Betaseron. Remove needle and repeat begin with a new syringe.
If no blood appears in the syringe, slowly push the plunger in until the syringe is empty.

, Gently massage the injection site for a few moments with the dry coon ball or gauze pad.

, Throw away used alcohol prep pads in a trash can.

Confront your fear.,
Consider the source of your fear.,
Rationalise your fear.,
Practice applied tension.",How to Overcome the Fear of Injections1," Knowing more about what you’re afraid of could very well help you overcome your fear by making needles and injections seem more ordinary.Do some research about injections: their history, their purpose, even their dangers.


Look up pictures of needles and injections online to desensitize yourself. To take this to the next level you might consider handling real (clean, unused) syringes for a few minutes everyday.This might be difficult to start with, but it could help you overcome your fear. The more exposure you have to needles the more ordinary they will seem.;
, Some people develop a fear of injections because they associate them with another traumatizing event. Often those who suffer from needle phobia are those who had a lot of blood tests or procedures involving needles when they were a child.Think back over your childhood and talk to your parents about this. Understanding the roots of your fear can help you to confront it.

, Rather than dwelling on your fear of injections, focus instead on how the injection is going to help you.Continually remind yourself that you're protecting yourself from something much worse than a simple injection.Or, if you’re donating blood, think about all of the people you’re helping by overcoming your fear.List your fears and concerns (“Injections are painful!”), and then counter those fears with positive, rational ideas (“Injections keep me healthy!”).If you have a child who’s scared of needles, be honest with him or her about the importance of the injection. And don’t tiptoe around the pain. Be honest about that too., One of the most effective ways to combat fear, and the drop in blood pressure that can lead to fainting, is to practice applied tension. If you begin to feel faint or have in the past fainted at the sight of needles, applied tension, which helps regulate your blood pressure, can help keep you from fainting again. You will need to learn how to do this before you go for the injection.If you start to feel scared, applied tension can help you calm down before the injection. To practice applied tension, follow these steps:


Sit comfortably.
Tense the muscles in your arms, legs, and upper body and maintain that tension for about 10 to 15 seconds, or until your face begins to feel flush.
Relax your muscles.
After 30 seconds, tense your muscles again.
Repeat until you’ve done this five times.

Know IV-related complications.",How to Insert an IV," Though starting an IV isn't nearly as serious of an undertaking as more complicated procedures, it still requires the same basic level of preparation and precaution as any minor medical procedure. Before you begin, you'll want to have all of the tools and equipment you need handy and you'll want to be sure that any materials which will come into contact with the patient's body — especially your needles — are fresh and sterile. To start a typical IV line, you will need:Sterile disposable gloves
Appropriate size ""over-the-needle"" IV catheter (typically 14 - 25 gauge)
Bag of IV fluid
Non-latex tourniquet
Sterile bandage or dressing
Gauze
Alcohol wipes
Medical tape
Sharps container
Sterile pad or paper (set small tools out on this to keep them close at hand);
, An important part of the process of starting an IV is introducing yourself to the patient and explaining the procedure that's about to occur. Talking to patients and sharing this basic information helps put them at ease and ensures that no part of the process surprises or shocks them. In addition, it ensures that you have their full consent to proceed. When you're done, have the patient lay or recline where they'll be receiving their IV.


When patients are nervous, their veins may contract somewhat in a process called vasoconstriction.This makes it harder to start an IV, so make sure your patient is as relaxed and comfortable as possible before proceeding.
You may want to ask whether the patient has had any trouble with IVs in the past. If so, the patient may be able to tell you which sites are easiest to access.

, Next, prime the IV tubing by suspending the IV bag from an elevated stand, filling the tubing with saline solution, and checking for any bubbles. If necessary, clamp the tubing so that the solution doesn't drip onto the floor. Be sure to remove any bubbles from the tubing by gently tapping, squeezing, or flushing them out of the line. A dated and signed sticker should then be placed on both the IV tubing and the IV bag.Injecting air bubbles into a patient's bloodstream can cause a serious condition called an embolism.
One easy technique for removing bubbles from the IV tubing is to uncoil the tubing to its full length and run the roller valve all the way up to the drip chamber. Next, puncture the IV bag with the tubing spike and pinch the drip chamber. Open the roller valve and release the line — fluid should flow down the length of the tubing without producing any bubbles.

, Typically, IV catheters are mounted over the needle used to puncture the vein. After the vein is accessed, the catheter is left in place for easy access to the vein. Catheters come in different sizes called gauges. The smaller the gauge number, the thicker the catheter and the more rapidly medicine can be administered and blood can be drawn. However, thick catheters are also cause more painful insertion, so it's important not to use a catheter that's bigger than you need.


In general, for IVs, you'll need a catheter that's about 14-25 gauge. Tend towards higher-gauge (thinner) catheters for children and the elderly, but tend towards lower-gauge (thicker) catheters when rapid transfusion is needed.

, Inserting an IV pierces the skin and introduces foreign equipment directly into the bloodstream. To avoid the risk of a dangerous infection, it's important to wash your hands and dry them with a clean paper towel before beginning, then put on sterile gloves before you handle your equipment and touch the patient. If at any point your gloves' sterility becomes compromised, take them off and put on a new pair — it's better to be safe than sorry. Below are situations where most medical standards require changing gloves:Before touching the patient
Before clean/aseptic procedures (like administering IV medications)
After procedures with a risk of body fluid exposure
After touching the patient
After touching the patient's surroundings
Before moving to a different patient

, Next, you'll want to find a site on the patient to administer the IV. For adult patients, the most accessible veins are long, straight ones in upper extremities that aren’t near joints and are furthest from the body. For children, the scalp, hand, or foot is more preferable as an IV site than a leg, arm or elbow fold. While any accessible vein can be used to start an IV, it’s best to avoid veins in the patient’s dominant hand.If your patient has a history of hard-to-reach veins, ask where doctors have previously had success. Usually, patients with previous difficult IV experiences will know where their veins are most accessible. Note that, regardless of the presence of veins, there are certain places you won't want to insert an IV. These include:Places where the IV will interfere with surgery
In the same location as another recent IV
In a site that shows signs of infection (redness, swelling, irritation, etc.)
In a limb on the same side of the body as a mastectomy or vascular graft (this can lead to complications)

, To get your chosen veins to swell up for easy insertion, apply a tourniquet behind (in the direction of the torso) the intended IV site. For instance, if you're going to insert the IV into the typical site of the underside of the forearm, you might put the tourniquet part of the way up the upper arm.


Don't tie the tourniquet too tight — this can cause bruising, especially in the elderly. It should be tight, but not so tight that you can't slip a finger underneath.
Letting the limb hang limp towards the floor while a tourniquet is in place can help the veins become more prominent by increasing the blood flow to the limb.

, If you're having a hard time finding suitable veins, it can be helpful to palpate the patient's skin in the area of the IV site. Align your finger in the direction of the vein, then press down on the skin above it. You should feel the vein ""push back"". Continue pressing with a bouncing motion for about 20-30 seconds.The vein should become visibly larger., Next, tear open a fresh alcohol wipe (or use a similar sterilising method like chlorhexidine) and apply it to the skin in the area that the IV will be inserted. Wipe gently but thoroughly, ensuring an even coat of alcohol. This kills bacteria on the skin, minimizing the chance of infection when the skin is punctured., Remove the catheter from its sterile packaging. Briefly inspect it to ensure that it is intact and working. Press down on the flashback chamber to ensure it is tight. Spin the catheter hub to ensure it sits loosely on the needle. Remove the protective cap and inspect the needle, taking care to ensure the needle doesn't touch anything. If everything looks in order, prepare to insert the needle.


Don't allow the catheter or needle to come into contact with anything other than the patient's skin in the IV site. This can compromise their sterility and increase the risk of infection.

, Use the non-dominant hand to stabilise the patient's limb with gentle pressure, taking care not to touch the IV site directly. Take the catheter in your dominant hand and insert the needle (bevel facing up) through the skin. Reduce the angle of insertion as you advance the needle into the vein — use a shallow-angled approach.


Look for a flashback of blood at the catheter hub. This is a sign that you've successfully hit the vein. Once you see the flashback, advance the needle one more centimeter (cm) into the vein., Inserting an IV is a delicate art — sometimes, even experienced doctors and nurses miss the vein on their first attempt, especially if the patient has difficult-to-hit veins. If you advance the needle and don't see a flashback of blood, explain to the patient that you've missed and are going to try again. Try to be pleasant to the patient — this process can be painful.


If you repeatedly miss the vein, apologize to the patient, remove the needle and catheter, and try again on a different limb with a fresh needle and catheter. Attempting numerous inserts on the same vein can be very painful for the patient and leave lasting bruising.
You might comfort the patient by explaining why it didn’t work and also saying something like, “Sometimes these things just happen. It’s no one’s fault. We should get it right next time.”, Maintaining pressure on the skin, pull the needle (only the needle — not the catheter) about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) back out of the vein. Slowly advance the catheter into the vein while maintaining pressure on the vein and skin. When the cannula is seated in the vein, remove the tourniquet and secure the catheter by placing a sterile bandage or dressing (like Tegaderm) over the lower half of the catheter hub.


Be sure not to block the the IV tubing connection with your dressing.

, Hold onto the catheter hub with your thumb and index finger. Keep it securely seated in the vein. Using your other hand, carefully pull the needle (and only the needle) out of the vein. Dispose of the needle in a proper sharps container. Next, remove the protective cover from the end of the primed IV tubing and carefully insert it into the catheter hub. Secure it in the catheter by screwing and locking in place., Finally, secure the IV against the patient's skin. Place a piece of tape over the catheter hub, then make a loop in the catheter tubing and tape this down with a second piece of tape over the first. Secure the other end of the loop above the site of the IV with a third piece of tape. Putting loops in the tubing reduces the strain on the IV catheter, making it more comfortable for the patient and less likely to accidentally be removed from the vein.


Make sure there are no kinks in the loop — this can interfere with the flow of fluids into the bloodstream., Open the IV roller clamp and look for drips forming in the drip chamber. Check that the IV is infusing into the vein by occluding the vein (pressing down on it to block its flow) distal to the site of the IV (away from the torso). The flow of drips should slow and stop, then restart flowing when you stop occluding the vein.

, IVs left in for an extended period of time are at a greater risk of infection than IVs used only for a single operation or procedure. To reduce the risk of infection, it's important to carefully remove the dressing, clean the site of the IV, and put a new dressing in place. In general, transparent dressings should be changed roughly weekly, while gauze dressings should be changed more frequently because they don't allow observation of the IV site.Don't forget to wash your hands and wear a fresh pair of gloves every time you touch a patient's IV site. This is especially important for when you're changing dressings, as the use of long-term IV connections is associated with an increased rate of infection., To remove an IV, first, close the roller clamp to stop the flow of fluid. Gently remove the tape and dressing to expose the catheter hub and IV site. Place a clean piece of gauze over the IV site and apply delicate pressure as you pull the catheter out. Instruct the patient to hold the gauze in place to stop the flow of blood.


You may want to secure the gauze over the puncture site with tape or a bandage, such as Coban. However, with gentle pressure, for most patients, bleeding will stop quickly enough that this isn't absolutely necessary.

, The needles used to start an IV qualify as medical sharps and need to placed in a well-marked sharps container immediately after use. Because needles can transfer infectious agents and even blood-borne illnesses from person to person if handled improperly, it's extremely important to ensure that these needles aren't disposed with ordinary trash, even if you're sure that the patient is perfectly healthy.

, Though IVs are usually safe procedures, there is always a very small but real chance that complications will result from the IV. It's important to know the most common signs of IV complications to be able to provide the best care to the patient and, if need, to know when to get emergency care. Some IV complications (and their symptoms are below:Infiltration: Occurs when fluid is injected outside of the vein into surrounding soft tissue. Will cause swelling and smooth, pale skin in the affected area. Can be a minor or serious issue depending on the medicine being administered.
Hematoma: Occurs when blood leaks from the vein into the surrounding tissue, usually after more than one vein wall is accidentally punctured. Often accompanied by pain, bruising, and irritation. Will usually resolve within several weeks light pressure.
Embolism: Occurs after injecting air into the vein. Often caused by air bubbles in the IV tubing. Children are especially at risk. In serious cases, causes trouble breathing, chest pain, blue skin, low blood pressure, and even stroke and heart attack.
Thrombosis and endarteritis: Life-threatening conditions that can result from injecting into an artery, rather than a vein. Can lead to severe pain, compartment syndrome (high pressure on a muscle leading to a very painful ""tight"" or ""full"" feeling) gangrene, motor dysfunction, and even the eventual loss of the limb.

Wash your hands.,
Ask for help if you need it.,
Monitor your symptoms.,
Unwrap the syringe.,
Remove the air bubble.,
Follow the instructions given to you by the doctor.,
Choose the injection site and clean it with alcohol.,
Inject the needle into your skin.,
Dispose of the syringe safely.",How to Inject Ovidrel," Remember to always wash your hands thoroughly before you begin the injection process. This will help decrease the risk of infection, especially at the injection site.Use an antibacterial hand-sanitizing soap and a clean, disposable paper towel to dry your hands.;
, If you are uncomfortable about injecting yourself with the Ovidrel shot, it is possible to get the shot administered at your doctor’s office. You will likely have to pay for any fees associated with a visit to the doctor’s office. But this may be a better option for you if you feel unable to do the injection yourself.But remember that it is quite safe to do these injections at home, so you may want to try pushing through your uncertainty and doing it yourself anyways. The first time is always the hardest, and it only gets easier each time.
Your partner may also be able to administer the Ovidrel shot, if they have been properly trained by the doctor.

, After injecting the Ovidrel, make sure you monitor your symptoms to ensure that you don’t have a bad reaction to the drug. Reactions are rare, but you want to be able to notify your doctor immediately if you notice anything out of the ordinary.Normal side effects include slight discomfort, swelling, or bruising at the injection site; mild nausea; or digestive issues.
Contact your doctor immediately if you experience extreme abdominal pain, intense nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, dizziness, or decreased urination.

, Take the syringe with the Ovidrel injection out of the box it came in. You’ll need to unwrap the packaging and remove the cap from the needle end of the syringe.Make sure the syringe is in the original sealed package. It is dangerous to use needles that are not sterilized or that have been used by others.

, Once you unwrap the syringe, you’ll see a small air bubble on top of the liquid inside; this needs to be removed. You may need to gently tap the syringe until the air bubbles settle at the top. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up and push the plunger slowly and gently until the air bubble is completely gone.Be careful not to push too quickly or you may waste quite a bit of the liquid medication inside. You want to only expel one tiny drop that covers the tip of the needle.

, Make sure that you follow any directions your doctor gave you about administering the Ovidrel injection.You should also discuss your overall health and any preexisting conditions you may have with your doctor before administering the Ovidrel treatment.

, You should pick a spot that is about two inches away you’re your bellybutton – on either side or below it. Sterilize the area with an alcohol swab and let it air dry.Drying the injection site (or wiping off any excess alcohol) with a towel will re-contaminate the area and negate the sterilizing process you just completed.

, Sit in a comfortable location and pinch an inch or so of your skin/fat in the now sterilized area. Stick the tip of the needle into your skin and slowly push down on the plunger until the entire dose is emptied out of the syringe.Make sure you stick the needle far enough into your skin (about ¼ inch or so).
Gently remove the needle and use a Band-Aid (or gauze) if your skin is bleeding at the injection site.

, Once you’ve finished injecting the Ovidrel, you need to dispose of the syringe in a safe manner. Put the cap back on the syringe and put it in a waste bin intended for hazardous/sharp objects.If you don’t have access to this kind of trash disposal, try putting the syringe inside a thick plastic bottle with the lid screwed on. This should protect others from accidentally getting poked by the needle.

Realize that needles are smaller.,
Talk to you doctor.,
Look away from the injection site.,
Distract yourself with media.,
Use relaxation techniques.,
Script the injection.,
Frame the injection in simple terms.,
Take someone to support you.,
Watch for injection site reactions.,
Apply ice therapy.,
Take pain medication.,
Give the site some rest.,
Seek medical attention for allergic reactions or infection.",How to Manage a Painful Injection," Most people had injections as children and may have bad feelings associated with them.But realizing that needles are now much thinner and cause less pain may help relax you before an injection.Ask your doctor or the person injecting you about the size of the needle if you like or what type of pain you might feel. In some cases, they may even show you how small it is.
Recognize that fear of needles or injections is very common.;
, If you are scared, talk to your doctor or health professional before and during the injection. This can help reassure and distract you.Speak with your health professional before the injection about any fears or concerns you have. Ask her to explain how she will do the injection before she starts.
Ask your doctor to talk to you while she injects you as a distraction technique. Keep the conversation light and not related to your health. For example, you could tell her about your upcoming vacation and ask her if she has any suggestions for it., A recent study suggests that looking away while you’re getting an injection may be the best way to distract yourself.Focus on an object in the opposite direction of where you are getting the injection.


Look at a picture or other object in the room.
Watch your feet. This can help you take the focus off of your injection site.Closing your eyes may help you relax and avoid anticipation of the injection. Imagine something else like a warm beach while your eyes are closed.

, Being able to tune out an upcoming injection may help you relax and distract you. Try different media like music or your tablet.Tell your health professional you’d like to distract yourself with media you have brought.Listen to soothing and slow music.Watch a show or movie you enjoy.Watch a funny video before and during your injection to relax you. This may help you associate shots with humor instead of pain., Relaxing your entire body can help you get through an injection. From breathing exercises to medication, try different relaxation techniques before and during an injection.


Squeeze a stress ball or other type of sensory object with the hand opposite your injection arm.Breathe slowly and deeply. Inhale deeply for four seconds and then exhale for the same amount of time. This type of rhythmic breathing, sometimes called pranayama, can relax you and may also distract you.
Double up on your relaxation techniques if necessary.Tense and release muscle groups starting with your toes and ending at your forehead. Tense muscle groups for about 10 seconds and then give them 10 seconds to release. Take a deep breath in between groups to further relax you.
Take an anti-anxiety medication to relax you. The injection is very quick, and likely the anxiety medication will far exceed the medication, so only use this if your fear or nervousness is extreme. Make sure to let the doctor know that you took the medication in case there are any contraindications with the injection and make sure you have someone to drive you home afterwards.

, Facing a needle can make you tense. Use the behavioral tactic of image scripting to help you get through the injection.


Write a “script” for the injection. For example, write down what you will say to your doctor and the type of conversation you’d like to have. “Hello Dr. Maier, it’s nice to see you today. I know I’m here for an injection and I’m a bit scared. But I’d like to talk about my upcoming vacation to Munich while you give me the injection.”
Stick to the script as much as you can during the procedure. Take your notes with you if that helps.

, Framing and guided imagery are behavioral techniques that can shape how you think and feel about specific situations by making them seem commonplace or banal. Use either technique to help you manage your injection appointment.


Reframe the injection as “this is a quick poke and feels like a baby bee sting.”Guide yourself with different imagery during the injection. For example, picture yourself on the top of a mountain or on a warm beach.
Work with manageable units to manage the injection. For example, break it up into greeting the doctor, asking questions, distracting yourself during the procedure, and then happily heading home.

, Ask a friend or family member to come to your injection appointment with you. She can talk as a way of calming and distracting you.Ask your health professional if your support person can come with you into the procedure room.
Sit across from your support person. Hold her hand if that helps you relax.
Talk to your support person about something completely unrelated like dinner or a movie you want to see.

, It’s not uncommon to have some pain or discomfort at an injection site for a few hours or days.Looking for signs of post-injection inflammatory reactions can help you figure out the best way to relieve your pain or if you need to see your doctor. Common symptoms are:Itching
Redness radiating from the injection site
Warmth
Swelling
Tenderness
Pain

, Put an ice or cold pack over the injection site. This can relieve itching, swelling, and pain by constricting blood flow and cooling your skin.Leave the ice on the site for 15 – 20 minutes.Do this three to four times per day until the pain eases.Use a bag of frozen vegetables if you don’t have an ice pack.
Put something like a towel between your skin and the ice or cold pack to minimize the risk of frostbite.Put a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the injection site if you don’t want to use ice.Avoid applying heat to your injection site. This can increase swelling as it brings more blood to infected area., Over-the-counter medications can relieve pain and swelling.Consider taking these medications if you have a lot of pain or inflammation at the injection site.


Take pain relievers including ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers under 18, as it increases the risk for Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal condition.Minimize swelling with NSAIDs (non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen and naproxen sodium., Avoid taxing the area where you had an injection, especially if it was a cortisone shot.This can give the injection site time to heal and may prevent further pain or discomfort.Keep heavy lifting to a minimum if you got a shot in the arm.
Stay off of your feet if you got an injection on your leg.If you have received a steroid shot, avoid heat for 24 hours to ensure the injection will have maximum response.

, In some cases, injections can cause allergic reactions or prolonged pain. Seek medical attention as soon as possible if you experience any of the following symptoms or are unsure about your medication:Worsening pain, redness, warmth, swelling, or itching
Fever
Chills
Muscle aches
Difficulty breathing
High-pitched or uncontrolled crying in children

Wash your hands prior to starting the procedure.,
Reassure the patient and explain how the procedure will unfold.,
Sanitize the area with an alcohol swab.,
Encourage the patient to relax.If the muscle receiving the injection is tense, it will hurt more, so relaxing the muscle as much as possible helps to ensure the least pain felt on injection.,
Insert the needle into the specific location.,
Pull back the plunger before injecting.,
Inject the medication slowly.While it is best to insert the needle quickly to minimize pain, the opposite is true for the actual injection.,
Pull the needle out at the same angle as you injected it.,
Dispose of the needle properly.,
Know the parts of a syringe.,
Know where to give the injection.,
Know whom you're injecting.,
Know how to fill the needle with medication.,
Understand the advantages of the Z-track method.,
Repeat the steps of hand-washing, filling the syringe, and choosing and cleaning the injection site.

,
Pull the skin taut 1 inch (2.5 cm) laterally to the side with your non-dominant hand.,
Insert the needle at a 90° angle into the muscle layer with your dominant hand.,
Keep the needle in place for 10 seconds.,
Withdraw the needle in a swift motion and release the skin.",How to Give an Intramuscular Injection," Good hygiene is important to minimize the risk of infection. Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds., Specify the location of the injection you are giving, and describe how the medication will feel once injected if the patient does not already know.Some medications can be initially painful or sting upon injection. Most do not, but it is important for the patient to be aware of this if it is the case to minimize any distress that may ensue from not knowing.

, Prior to performing the injection, it is important that the patch of skin over the muscle where the injection will take place is sterilized and clean. Again, this minimizes the chances of an infection following the injection.Allow the alcohol to air dry for 30 seconds. Do not touch the area until you give the injection; if you do, you'll just have to clean the area again.

,


It can sometimes be helpful to distract the patient before injecting by asking them questions about their life. When the patient is distracted, their muscle is more likely to be relaxed.
Some people also prefer to be positioned in a way in which they cannot see the injection taking place. Seeing the needle approaching can cause worry and distress in some, and will result not only in increased anxiety, but also in tensing of the muscle. To help the patient relax, suggest they look in another direction if they want to.

, Start by removing the cap, and then insert it smoothly at an angle of 90 degrees to the skin. If you are just learning to give the injection, do not go too quickly, as you want to ensure you do not push the needle in too far and hit the bone. About one third of the needle should remain exposed. Be careful not to go so fast that you either miss the spot or cause any more damage to the skin than is needed.As you practice and become used to giving the injection, you can increase your speed. The quicker the insertion, the less pain your patient will feel; however, you do not want to sacrifice safety for speed.
It can be helpful to pull up the skin around the injection site with your non-dominant hand (as your dominant hand will be doing the injection) prior to injecting. Pulling up the skin can help you mark your target and make it less painful for the patient when the needle goes in.

, After injecting the needle but before injecting the medication, pull the plunger back a little. Although this may seem counter-intuitive, it is important because if any blood comes into the syringe when you pull back, it means your needle is located in a blood vessel and not in the muscle.You will need to begin again with a new needle and syringe if this happens.The medication is designed to be injected into a muscle and not into the bloodstream, so if you see any red color when you pull back you will need to remove the needle and dispose of it. Prepare a new needle and choose a different injection site — don't try to give the shot in the same place.
Most often the needle lands in the muscle itself. Rarely does it land in a blood vessel, but it is always best to be safe rather than sorry prior to injecting.

, This is because the medication takes up space in the muscle, and the surrounding tissue will need to stretch to accommodate the added fluid in the space. Injecting slowly gives more time for this to happen and causes the patient less pain.

, Do this once you're confident all the medicine has been injected.


Press gently on the injection site with the 2 x 2 gauze.The recipient may feel a slight discomfort; this is normal. Have the recipient hold the gauze in place while you dispose of the needle.

, Do not throw needles into the trash. You may receive a hard plastic container made especially for used syringes and needles. You can also use a soda bottle or other plastic bottle with a screw lid. Make sure that both the syringe and needle fit into the container easily and cannot break through the sides.Ask your caregiver or a pharmacist what your state or local requirements are for getting rid of used syringes and needles.

, It'll be much easier to administer a shot if you understand the mechanics behind what you're doing.


Syringes have three main parts: the needle, barrel and plunger. The needle goes into the muscle; the barrel has markings, either in cc (cubic centimeters) or mL (milliliters), with numbers next to the markings, and it contains the medicine; the plunger is used to get medicine into and out of the syringe.Medication injected intramuscularly (IM) is measured in cm3s or mLs. The amount of medication in a cc is the same as in a mL.

, The human body has a number of spots that are most receptive.



Vastus Lateralis Muscle (Thigh): Look at your thigh and divide it into three equal parts. The middle third is where the injection would go. The thigh is a good place to give yourself an injection because it is easy to see. It is also a good spot for children younger than three years old.Ventrogluteal Muscle (Hip): To find the correct location, place the heel of your hand on the upper, outer part of the thigh where it meets the buttocks. Point your thumb at the groin and your fingers toward the person's head. Form a V with your fingers by separating your first finger from the other three fingers. You will feel the edge of a bone along the tips of your little and ring fingers. The place to give the injection is in the middle of the V. The hip is a good place for an injection for adults and children older than seven months.Deltoid Muscle (Upper arm muscle): Completely expose the upper arm. Feel for the bone that goes across the top of the upper arm. This bone is called the acromion process. The bottom of it will form the base of the triangle. The point of the triangle is directly below the middle of the base at about the level of the armpit. The correct area to give an injection is in the center of the triangle, 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) below the acromion process. This site should not be used if the person is very thin or the muscle is very small.Dorsogluteal Muscle (Buttocks): Expose one side of the buttocks. With an alcohol wipe, draw a line from the top of the crack between the buttocks to the side of the body. Find the middle of that line and go up 3 inches (7.6 cm). From that point, draw another line down and across the first line, ending about halfway down the buttock. You should have drawn a cross. In the upper outer square you will feel a curved bone. The injection will go in the upper outer square below the curved bone. Do not use this site for infants or children younger than three years old; their muscles are not developed enough., Each person has a place where it is best to receive the shot. Consider a few things before you administer the shot:


The person's age. For children and babies up to two years old, the thigh muscle is best. For those three years and older, the thigh or deltoid are both viable options. You should be using somewhere between a 22 and a 30 gauge needle (this will largely be determined by the thickness of the medication — your doctor will tell you which gauge to use).Note: For incredibly small children, a smaller needle is needed. The thigh can also tolerate a larger needle than the arm.Consider previous injection sites. If the person recently received an injection in one area, administer the shot in a different spot on their body. It helps prevent scars and skin damage., Some syringes get pre-filled with the medication. Other times, the medication is in a vial and needs to be drawn up into the syringe. Before administering medication from a vial, make sure you have the right type of medication, it is not expired, and that it is not discolored or have particles floating in the vial.If the vial is new, make sure the seal is not broken.


Sterilize the top of the vial with an alcohol swab.
Hold the syringe with the needle pointed up, the cap still on. Draw the plunger back to the line indicating your dose, filling the syringe with air.Insert the needle through the rubber top of the vial and press the plunger, pushing the air into the vial.With the vial upside-down and the tip of needle in the medicine, draw the plunger back again to the proper dose (or a little past if there might be air bubbles). Tap the syringe to move any air bubbles to the top, then push them into the vial. Make sure you still have the correct dose in the syringe.Remove the needle from the vial. If you don't plan on using it right away, make sure you cover the needle with the cap., When administering an IM injection, the penetrative action of the needle creates a narrow channel, or track, within the tissues. It may be possible for the medication to leak out of the body through this track. Applying the Z-track technique reduces skin irritation and allows for effective absorption by sealing the medication in the muscle tissue.,, Firmly hold to keep the skin and subcutaneous tissue in place.

, Pull back on the plunger slightly to check for blood return, then slowly push to inject the medication.

, This allows the medication to evenly disperse into the tissue.

, A zigzag path is created that closes off the track left by the needle and keeps the medication inside the muscle tissue. As a result, patients should experience less discomfort and lesions at the injection site.


Do not massage the site as this can cause the medication to leak, as well as irritation.

Bring a friend or family member along.,
Express your fear.,
Distract yourself.,
Position your body correctly.,
Try to relax.",How to Overcome the Fear of Injections2," Ask someone you trust to come with you when you get the shot. Having someone you know with you could provide you with a confidence boost.Ask them to hold your hand tightly during the procedure.

, Tell your doctor or nurse that you are scared. Talking about your fear can let that person know to treat you with extra care. He or she might even be able to talk you through it and offer you tips to help you relax and keep things in perspective.If you would like to donate blood you might find it less scary if you tell the person drawing your blood that he or she has one chance to get it right.Doing this can help you feel more in control of the situation.

, Many people focus on getting the shot, but taking your mind off of the injection by, among other things, looking the other way, can help allay your fears.Strike up a conversation with someone else in the room, be it the doctor, the nurse, or the family member or friend who has accompanied you.Research has found that doctors who talked to trauma patients about something other than the trauma itself were able to significantly reduce the patient's anxiety levels.Concentrate on something else in the room. Try rearranging the letters of a sign to make as many new words as you can.Play a game on your phone, listen to some soft music, or read a book or magazine , You might find that lying down or having your legs elevated while you receive and injections can help to ease your fear and symptoms. Lying with your head down and feet slightly elevated will lessen the chances of fainting. Even after the injection stay prone for a while, and don't try to jump up and run out. Take your time and listen to what the doctor or nurse is telling you.When you are lying down, place one hand on your stomach and concentrate on your breathing., Tensing up during the injection will make it hurt more later. Relax your arms, shoulder, and jaw. Look away, focus on your breathing, and take deep breaths. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.When the shot is about to be administered, take a deep breath and slowly count down from ten before breathing out. By the time you get to zero the procedure will be done!

Draw up a fear hierarchy.,
Start at the bottom.,
Steadily work your way up.",How to Overcome the Fear of Injections3," A fear hierarchy is a way to document the different degrees of fear you experience related to needles and injections. This technique gives you a clear progression, but allows you to move at your own pace and make your own records of what how find most fearful. Write down different aspects of needles and injections which scare you and rank them by the amount of distress they cause you, on a scale of 1-10. An example could look like this:


Having an injection in my arm - ranked 10/10.
Holding a needle - ranked 9/10.
Watching someone have an injection in real life - ranked 7/10.
Watching a video of an injection online - ranked 5/10.
Looking pictures of needles and injections - ranked 4/10.
Thinking about an injection - ranked 3/10., Once you have drawn up your hierarchy you will have already begun thinking about your fears, an important step in countering them. When you are ready, start at the bottom of your hierarchy and put yourself in the situation which gives you the lowest amount of distress. When you begin to feel distressed, practice applied tension or breathing for relaxation to bring your blood pressure back down and control your fear.Stay in this stressful situation until your anxiety has started to noticeably drop. As you come out of this situation, looking away from the video of an injection, or putting down the needle, take time to breathe deeply and relax.
Congratulate yourself on your progress and courage before moving up your hierarchy.

, Now you can steadily work your way up your hierarchy and keep track of your success. Only move on when you feel really confident with the previous situations, and don't worry if you need to re-do one situation a number of times before you feel comfortable. It's worth persisting with it.


Overcoming your fear will take time, practice, commitment and courage. But, it will certainly make your life freer from anxiety and stress in the long-run.

Try a painkiller.,
Take anti-anxiety medication.,
Consider therapy or counselling.",How to Overcome the Fear of Injections4," Some people who are afraid of needles are very sensitive to pain and the normal small amount of pain experienced when getting an injection will be heightened.If this is the case, you can ask the doctor or nurse to give you numbing cream, or apply an anaesthetic cream or warm compress to the area 20 minutes before you expect the receive the shot.Request either a thin needle or a butterfly needle. Butterfly needles, which can be more precise than standard needles, are often used on patients with needle phobia., Sometimes your doctor may recommend anti-anxiety medication for acute cases of needle phobia. If someone faints uncontrollably at the sight of a needle, anti-anxiety medication may be necessary in the short-term. You should never consider this unless your doctor suggests it, concentrate on combating your fear without medication.


If you are taking anti-anxiety medication you will take it before the injection, and may not be able to drive after the injection.When fainting is the primary concern, beta blockers can be an effective option, and should enable you to drive afterwards. But always talk to your doctor about your options.
Practising applied tension is a way to combat low blood pressure and fainting without medication.

, An acute fear of needles can be a serious problem if it stops you getting the shots and jabs you need to stay healthy and inoculated from disease. Fear of needles is a recognized condition and behavioural therapy may help you to deal with your fear.In more extreme cases, psychotherapy or hypnotherapy might be necessary."

Bandage the injection site.",How to Inject Into a Vein," The individual receiving the injection should drink one to four 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water approximately one hour before receiving the injection.


When the body is properly hydrated, blood pumps through the veins more readily, making those veins larger and easier to see.
On the other hand, it will be notably difficult to locate a vein on an individual who is moderately to severely dehydrated.;
, Gently press on the skin above the vein to help draw it closer to the surface.


Find the vein, then place one finger over it. Use this finger to gently press up and down in a gentle bouncing motion for 20 to 30 seconds. This should cause the vein to expand and become slightly easier to see.Contrary to popular belief, slapping a vein does not draw it to the surface. The nerves attached to the vein will contract upon feeling pain, which will actually make that blood vessel smaller and harder to see.

, Warmth causes the vein to dilate and grow, making it easier to find. For best results, warm up the injection site and the patient's entire body before an injection.


Never give an injection immediately after the patient comes inside after being out on a cold day. Give the patient time to warm up. Consider covering the patient with blankets or extra layers of clothing.Other options for warming up the entire body include drinking a warm beverage, like tea or coffee, or taking a warm bath. Only deliver the injection after the patient comes out of the bath, however, and not while he or she is still in the water.
If you need to warm the injection site, microwave a damp towel for 15 to 30 seconds and wrap the warm towel around the vein. You could also soak the injection site directly in warm water or warm it for several seconds with a hair dryer.

, Instruct the patient to lie down on a bed or sofa with his or her injecting arm hanging down over the side. Gravity should cause blood to rush to that arm, making the veins look bigger and darker.


Similarly, the patient can extend his or her injecting arm out and spin it around for 20 to 30 seconds. Centrifugal force will cause the blood to rush into the arm as it spins, and if done only a few minutes before the injection is delivered, the blood should enhance the appearance of the vein long enough to deliver the injection.

, Tell the patient to grab a stress ball and squeeze it as tight as possible immediately before the injection.Another option would be to have the patient rapidly open and close the hand into a fist for 30 seconds.
Either of these options will cause the blood to rush to the veins in the arm, making them easier to see.

, Before handling the medication or needle, you should wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap. Dry your hands completely using clean paper towels when you finish washing.


To further minimize the risk of infection or contamination, you may also wish to wear sterile, disposable medical gloves. Gloves are not always necessary but should be considered when handling medication for patients with immune deficiencies or weaknesses.

, Draw the correct dosage of medication into the syringe via the attached needle.


Inspect the bottle of medication to verify that it is safe to use. The medication itself should be free of debris and discoloring, and the bottle should not have any leaks or signs of damage.Only administer the exact dosage prescribed by the doctor. Do not use any more or less. Follow any additional instructions provided by your doctor concerning the proper preparation of your medication.
To draw the medication into the syringe:Pull the plunger back to draw air into the syringe. The amount of air in the syringe should match the amount of medication you will need to prepare.
Insert the needle into the rubber stopper of the medication bottle. Push the plunger to squeeze the air into the bottle.
Invert the bottle, completely covering the tip of the needle. Pull the plunger back and draw the medication into the syringe, stopping once you've measured out the correct dosage.
Gently tap the side of the syringe to knock any air bubbles to the surface. Depress the plunger just enough to press the air out of the syringe. Make sure that all air is out of the syringe before delivering the injection.
Remove the needle from the bottle and place a sterile cap or bag over it. Do not allow it to come into contact with any non-sterile surface. Set it aside until ready to use.



, Even though there are ways to increase visibility and access to the vein, there are still some locations that are generally preferred over others.


The veins at the inner elbow are relatively close to the skin, so they are some of the easiest to see and use.
The veins in the back of the hand are also easy to access, but the nerves accompanying these veins are also closer together, making this injection site more painful than the inner elbow.
When delivering frequent injections, you may need to alternate arms every other day to prevent the veins from collapsing.

, Thoroughly clean the chosen injection site with an isopropyl alcohol pad.


If you do not have prepared cleansing pads, soak a sterile cotton ball in isopropyl alcohol and use that to clean the area. You must make sure that the skin at the injection site is thoroughly clean before delivering the injection.

, Wrap a tourniquet 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) above the injection site. Use a loose overhand knot or simply tuck the tourniquet ends into the band to secure it.


The tourniquet must be easy to remove.
For injections delivered to the inner elbow, make sure that the tourniquet is tied above the mound of the bicep and not over the bicep itself.
If the vein is difficult to see, consider tying the tourniquet over the patient's shoulder to help squeeze blood into the arm.
For extremely difficult to find veins, consider using a blood pressure cuff instead of a tourniquet. Pump until the pressure is just above the diastolic pressure point, then release the pressure before delivering the injection.

, Only begin the injection once you can clearly identify the vein you'll be injecting into.


Injecting medication meant for intravenous delivery into another part of the body can be dangerous and may even be fatal.
Review the suggestions listed in the ""Increase Access to the Vein"" section of this article if you need help increasing vein visibility. If those suggestions do not help, seek professional medical advice before continuing.

, Remove the prepared needle from its sterile resting place and carefully insert the tip into the vein at the injection site.The needle must be inserted at a 45 degree angle with the vein.
You must insert the needle so that the medication will be injected in the same direction blood flows. Since veins carry blood to the heart, the medication should be injected so that it also flows to the heart.
If you have any doubt or question about the proper placement of the needle, check with a qualified doctor or nurse before making any injections into a vein.

, Carefully pull the plunger back by a small amount. You need to check the site for blood.


If you do not draw any blood into the syringe, you have missed the vein. Pull the needle out and try again.
If the blood comes out with notable pressure and appears bright red and foamy, you have inserted the needle into an artery. Immediately pull the needle out and apply direct pressure to the site to stop the bleeding. Try again once the bleeding has stopped.
If you draw dark red blood, you should have successfully hit a vein and can proceed with the rest of the process.

, Take the tourniquet off before you actually deliver the injection.


If the patient has also been squeezing his or her hand into a fist, you should also instruct the patient to stop at this point.
Pressure is helpful when locating the vein, but when you inject medication into it, too much pressure could cause the vein to burst.

, Push the plunger down to inject the medication into the vein.


Push with steady pressure until all of the medication has been delivered.

, After delivering the medication, remove the needle and immediately apply pressure to the injection site.


It is common for intravenous injections to cause a little bleeding. A moderate amount of pressure should be enough to stop the bleeding, however.
To minimize the risk of infection, place sterile gauze in between your hand and the injection site when applying pressure.
If bleeding is excessive and does not stop, call for emergency medical care.

, Cover the injection site with a fresh piece of sterile gauze, then hold the gauze in place using medical tape or an adhesive bandage.


After bandaging the injection site, the process is complete.

Make a note of the injection site.",How to Give an Intradermal Injection," Check the physician’s orders, MAR, and the Parenteral Drug Therapy Manual (PDTM) to identify the correct medication to be administered. Then prepare the medication by sticking the syringe into the appropriate vial.Make sure to fill the syringe with an appropriate amount of medication. The dosage of an intradermal injection is typically below 0.5 ml.;
, Place non-sterile gloves, a syringe, alcohol swabs, and gauze on a tray. Place the tray near your workstation.Make sure the needle you are using is a 3⁄8 to 3⁄4 inch (1.0 to 1.9 cm), 26 to 28 gauge needle.
Non-sterile, medical gloves are typically used for medical procedures that are non-surgical., Introduce yourself to the patient. To reduce the patient’s anxiety about the procedure, explain to the patient why the procedure is being done and what it will entail.Also, allow the patient to express any concerns and to ask questions before you begin.

, To avoid any kind of contamination, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Lather your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds and rinse with warm water. Before turning off the water, dry your hands with paper towels and use the paper towels to turn off the faucet. Once your hands are dry, put on your medical gloves to prepare for the procedure., Intradermal injections are usually given on the inner surface of the forearm. Choose an injection site that is free of hair, moles, rashes, scars, and other skin lesions.Intradermal injections can also be administered on the patient’s thigh or the back of their upper arm. Ask the patient where they prefer you to administer the medication.

, Ensure you have the correct medication and dosage. You should also double-check the patient’s name to be sure you are administering the correct medication to the correct person. Ensure the patient knows what you are administering. You could say “the doctor ordered ‘xyz medication.’ Is this what you were expecting?”, If you are giving the injection through the patient’s inner forearm, then position their arm with their palm facing up. Their arm should be relaxed with their elbow flexed., Using a firm, circular motion, wipe the injection site with the antiseptic or alcohol swab. Let the injection site dry completely before proceeding.By allowing the skin to dry completely before inserting the needle, you can prevent alcohol and other pathogens from entering the skin when the needle is inserted.
Since intradermal injections do not involve the penetration of major blood vessels, you do not need to aspirate the syringe.

, Use your non-dominant hand to do this. Place your thumb below the injection site and your middle finger above it. Use these fingers to gently pull the skin taut to ensure easy penetration of the needle.Try to avoid moving the skin to the side or drawing the skin too far back.

, Use your dominant hand to hold the syringe parallel to the patient’s arm. The bevel should be facing up. Slightly angle the needle so that it is at a 5 to 15 degree angle relative to the skin.Make sure to place your fingers and thumb on the sides of the barrel. If they are underneath the barrel, this can cause the angle of insertion to go beyond 15 degrees.

, Slowly insert the needle into the patient’s skin until it is ¼ inch (6.35 mm) in, or the entire bevel is under the skin. Once the syringe is in place, remove your non-dominant hand to release the tension surrounding the injection site. Use this hand to push the plunger in to administer the medication., Do this as you are administering the medication. A weal or bleb is an area of the skin that is raised like a blister or bubble. The presence of a weal indicates that the medicine has been administered into the dermis properly.If a weal or bleb does not form, then remove the needle and repeat the procedure on another site.

, Do this once all of the medication has been administered. Slowly remove the needle at an angle that is the same as the insertion angle. This will help minimize damage to the tissues at the injection site and discomfort to the patient., Apply gauze and a bandage (if necessary) to the injection site. Try to avoid massaging the injection site. By massaging the area, you may cause the medication to spread to the underlying subcutaneous tissues., Place the safety cap on the needle. Then throw away the needle in a sharps container. Additionally, properly dispose of any contaminated supplies., Remove your medical gloves and throw them away. Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap. Dry them with clean paper towels., It’s a good idea to write down where on the body you administered the medication. This is especially useful if the patient gets injections often, as it will help other medical personnel know to rotate the injection sites so that one area is not constantly used."

If your medicine has frozen at some point, you’ll need to discard it., After you’ve made sure the medicine has been stored appropriately, look at the expiration date. Verify that the medicine is still good. If it is not, do not use it., Before injecting Heparin, you need to make a good note of the amount of the drug you need to inject. This is important, as too little of the medication won’t have the desired effect and too much could hurt you.

It is best to write down the amount of Heparin you need to inject so you’ll know how much you need to fill your syringe with.

, Before you handle the syringe or vial of Heparin, you should wash your hands thoroughly. This is important, as failure to wash your hands could introduce bacteria to the syringe – resulting in infection at the injection site.

Use antibacterial soap., Your vial of Heparin will be covered with a plastic cap. Make sure to remove the cap and discard it. Then, take the bottle in your hands and slowly roll the bottle back and forth. This will mix the medicine in preparation for injection.

Do not shake the bottle., This will sanitize it and lower the chances of infection. If you don’t wipe the top, you could introduce bacteria into your body., Remove the cap of the needle and avoid touching it. Then, pull back the plunger of the syringe to the point that corresponds with the amount of medicine you will need to inject. This will fill the plunger with air., Firmly insert the needle into the rubber stopper of the vial. Push it in a steady fashion. Then push the plunger of the syringe down. This way, the air from the syringe will go into the vial., After you injected air into the vial, you’ll need to flip the bottle upside down while the needle is still in it. Then, pull the plunger back to the point specified by the prescription.

Make sure the liquid Heparin covers the needle or you will pull back air rather than Heparin.
Review the dosage amount with the doctor or nurse before leaving with your prescription. Make sure not to fill the syringe with any more or any less of the medicine than the doctor has recommended., Carefully withdraw the needle from the bottle. Then, place the bottle down. At the same time, make sure the needle doesn’t touch anything.Then, hold the syringe needle up, tap to remove air bubbles, and prepare the syringe by pushing the plunger down. This will move the Heparin into the needle, making it ready for insertion., Choose a spot on your body where you want to give yourself the shot. You can inject it into your abdomen, thighs, or the outer deltoid area of your upper arm. Ultimately, the site of injection is up to you. To decide, you may want to consider the discomfort involved and possible bruising.Don’t give yourself a shot into any area of your body that is bruised, swollen, or tender.
Don’t give your Heparin shot within 1 inch (2.54 cm) of a scar or 2 inches (5.08 cm) of your bellybutton.

, Using your fingers and a thumb, pinch some of your skin together. By doing this, you'll create an area of extra skin and fatty tissue where you can inject the Heparin. If you don't do this, you could wind up injecting the Heparin into your muscle., Take the syringe and push it into your skin at a 45-degree angle. Make sure you push the needle all the way into the pinched-up fold of your skin and into your fatty tissue., After you've inserted the needle, push the plunger down in a slow and steady manner. This will release the Heparin into your fatty tissue. Make sure not to push down too quickly, as you need to provide time for the Heparin to spread out from the site of injection.Leave the needle in for 5 seconds after you’ve pushed the plunger down., Steadily withdraw the needle at the same angle you inserted it. Place the syringe down and press a piece of gauze against the injection site. Hold it until the injection point no longer bleeds.

Discard the gauze and cover the injection site with a Band-Aid.
Discard the needle in an appropriate container."

Determine what type of injection you are giving.,
Be familiar with the product packaging.,
Prepare a dose from a multi dose vial.,
Gather your supplies.,
Examine the medication.,
Wash your hands.,
Inspect the syringe and needle.,
Verify that you have the correct size and type of syringe.,
Fill the syringe.,
Get the patient comfortable.",How to Give an Injection1," Your doctor or should give you detailed directions on the type of injection you will administer as well as the technique. When you are ready, review the detailed instructions that come with the medication as well as the directions given to you by your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. If you have any questions or doubts about how and when to administer the injection, talk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. Ask questions if you are not sure about the correct syringe, needle length, and needle gauge before proceeding.Some medications come ready-to-use, while others require you to fill the needle with medication from a vial.
Be very clear on the supplies you need for the injection. Some people receive more than one type of injection at home.
It is easy to confuse the syringes and needles needed for one injection with those intended for use with another medication injection.;
, Not all injectable medication packaging is the same. Some medications may need reconstitution before administration. Many come packaged with everything you need including syringes and needles.Again, it is imperative that your healthcare provider teaches you about your medication and any preparatory steps specific to that medication. Simply reading the instructions or a ""How To"" is not sufficient — you must have access to a direct link to ask questions and become educated on your medication and the administration.


Once you have talked to your doctor, you can also review the product literature, which will give clear step-by-step instructions on anything you need to do in order to prepare the medication for administration. Again, this is should not be considered a replacement for talking to your healthcare provider about how to prepare and administer the medication.
The literature will also tell you the recommended syringe size, needle size, and needle gauge, if those are not included in the packaging.
Give a medication packaged in a single dose vial. Common manufacturer packaging for many injectable medications is done by putting the medication into a vial called a single dose vial.
The label on the medication vial will say either “single dose vial” or will contain the abbreviation, SDV.
This means each vial contains only one dose. There may be fluid left in the vial after you have prepared the dose you need to give.
The remainder of the medication in the vial is to be discarded and not saved for another dose.

, Other medications are packaged in a multi-dose-vial, which does allow for more than one dose to be withdrawn from the vial.


The label on the medication will say “multi-dose vial” or contain the abbreviation, MDV.
If the medication you are using is packaged in a multi-dose vial, use a permanent marker to write the date it was first opened on the container.
Store the medication in the refrigerator between doses. Do not freeze the medication.
Small amounts of preservatives may be used in the manufacturing process for medications contained in multi-dose-vial. This helps to minimize the growth of any contaminants, but only protects the purity of the medication for up to 30 days after the vial is opened.
The vial should be discarded 30 days after the first date of opening has passed, unless your doctor advises you otherwise.

, You will need the medication package or vial, the syringe that comes with the product if available, a purchased syringe-needle unit, or separate syringes and needles that are put together at the time of administration. Other items you need include alcohol pads, a small gauze pad or cotton ball, a band-aid, and a sharps container.Remove the outer seal from the medication vial then wipe the rubber top of the with an alcohol pad. Always let the area air dry after wiping with an alcohol pad. Blowing on the vial or wiped skin can cause contamination.
Use the gauze pad or cotton ball to apply pressure on the injection site to reduce bleeding. Cover this with a band-aid.
The sharps container is used as an important safety measure to protect the patient, caregiver, and community from biohazardous materials. The container is a thick, plastic, bin designed to hold used sharps. Sharps are lancets, syringes, and needles. When the sharps container is full, arrangements are made to transfer it to a place that destroys biohazard equipment., Be sure you have the right medicine in the right strength, and the expiration date has not passed. Be sure the medication vial or package has been stored according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Some products are stable when kept at room temperature before use and others may need refrigeration.Check the packaging for visible damage such as cracks or dents in the vial that holds the medication.
Look at the area around the top of the vial. Check for cracks and dents in the seal around the top of the medication container. Dents can mean that the sterility of the packaging may no longer be reliable.
Look at the liquid inside the container. Check for particulate matter which is anything unusual or floating inside the container. Most injectable medications are clear.
Some insulins appear cloudy. If you notice anything other than clear liquid inside the container, other than some insulins products, then discard it.

, Thoroughly clean your hands using soap and water.Include washing your nail area, between your fingers, and your wrist area.
This helps prevent contamination and reduce the risk of infection.
It is recommended to wear FDA approved gloves such as Medint Latex Examination Gloves prior to an ejection as an extra barrier against bacteria and infection.

, Be sure the syringe and needle are in unopened, sterile packaging that shows no evidence of damage or deterioration. Upon opening, check the syringe for cracks in the barrel or discoloration of any part of the syringe. This includes the rubber top on the plunger. Any damage or deterioration indicates the syringe should not be used.Examine the needle for any evidence of damage. Be sure the needle has not been bent or broken. Do not use any product that appears damaged including damage to the packaging that might indicate the needle is no longer considered sterile.
Some packaged syringes and needles have a visible expiration date, but not all manufacturers provide this on the packaging. If you are concerned that a product is too old to use, contact the manufacturer. Have any lot numbers available when you call.
Discard damaged or deteriorated syringes, or those that have expired, by putting them in a sharps container.

, Be sure to use a syringe designed for the injection you are giving. Avoid interchanging different types of syringes as this can result in serious errors in dosing. Use only the type of syringe recommended for the medication you are giving.Select a syringe that holds a little more than the amount you need to administer.
Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations regarding the needle length and gauge
The needle gauge is the number that describes the diameter of the needle. Larger numbers mean skinnier needles. Some medications are thicker and need a smaller gauge, or larger diameter needle.
Most syringes and needles are currently manufactured as a single unit for safety reasons. When you select your syringe size you are also selecting your needle length and gauge. Be sure you have the proper equipment to administer the injection. This information is detailed in the product literature, or is available by asking your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.Separate syringes and needles are still available. If this is what you have, then assemble the syringe and needle. Make sure that the syringe is the proper size and the needle is sterile, unused, and the correct length and gauge for the type of injection you're performing. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections use different needles.

, Follow the packaging instructions if available or proceed with filling the syringe from the medication vial.Sterilize the top of the vial with alcohol and allow it to air dry for several minutes.
Prepare to fill your syringe. Know exactly how much liquid medication you need to withdraw and administer for your dose. Your syringe should contain exactly the amount of the prescribed dose. This information is available on the prescription label or the instructions provided by the doctor or pharmacy.
To fill the syringe, pull the plunger back to fill it with air equal to the exact amount of fluid you will need.
Holding the vial upside down, insert the needle into the rubber seal, and push the plunger to inject the air from the syringe into the vial.
Pull the plunger out to withdraw the fluid to the exact amount needed for administration. Sometimes air bubbles are visible in the syringe. Tap the syringe gently while the needle is still in the medication vial. This moves the air to the top of the syringe.
Push the air back into the vial then withdraw more medication if needed to be sure you have the exact amount you need to administer.

, Consider icing the area before administering the injection to reduce pain, particularly if the patient is a child. Let him or her sit in a comfortable position with the area exposed.Be sure you can comfortably reach the area of administration.
Have the person remain as still and relaxed as possible.
If you wipe the area with alcohol, wait several minutes for the area to air dry before inserting the needle into the skin.

Locate a suitable injection site.,
Don't worry about sterilising the injection site in an emergency.Medical professionals working in a hospital environment will often do so, especially for an IV; this practice is also more common in the US than in the UK or other countries.,
Hold the syringe in your hand like you would a dart.,
Insert the needle quickly, at a 90 degree angle.,
Slowly and gently, press down the contents of the plunger until all of the liquid in the syringe is emptied into the thigh.,
Press down gently on the injection site, using a clean tissue or an alcohol wipe to stop any bleeding.

",How to Give an Emergency Injection of Hydrocortisone1," It is okay to inject through clothing in an emergency, as shown in this educational video produced by the Addison's Disease Self-Help Group.The best site is the middle third of the outside of the thigh, but you can also inject into the muscle of the upper arm.This is a inter-muscular injection so you do not need to look for a vein or anything other than a muscular part of the thigh or upper arm.;
, However, for emergency IM treatment, the same rigorous standards of aseptic technique are less applicable. Occasionally, an emergency hydrocortisone injection is needed in remote locations without access to piped water. It is more important to inject promptly, and to avoid delays over concerns about meeting ideal standards of sterilisation or hygiene.


If you are making your own injection kit, you can include alcohol wipes, which are also useful to stop any bleeding afterwards.

,, It is not necessary to ""draw back"" if you hit a vein.

, It is less painful if you do this slowly. Quickly remove the needle.

Determine the injection site based on your doctor's instructions.,
Proceed with the injection.,
Determine your angle of entry.,
Inject the medicine into the patient.,
Administer an insulin injection.",How to Give an Injection2," A subcutaneous injection (SQ) is one given into the fatty layer of the skin. SQ injections are necessary for specific medications and for doses that usually require small amounts. The fat layer where the injection is given is between the skin and the muscle.One place that is good to give a subcutaneous injection is the abdomen. Select an area below the waist and above the hip bone, and about two inches away from the belly button. Avoid the belly button area.
SQ injections can be given in the thigh area, halfway between the knee and hip, and slightly to the side as long as you can pinch up one to two inches of skin.
The lower back is a good place for SQ injections. Target the area above the buttocks, below the waist, and halfway between the spine and the side.
The upper arm is a usable site as long as there is enough skin to pinch up one to two inches. Use the area of the upper arm that is halfway between the elbow and shoulder.
Alternating between sites will help prevent bruising and skin damage. You can also alter within the same general site by using different patches of skin within that area.

, Clean the skin on and around the site with rubbing alcohol. Allow the alcohol to dry before administering the injection. This shouldn't take more than a minute or two.Do not touch the wiped area with your hands or any other material before giving the injection.
Verify that you have the right drug, right site of injection, and that you have prepared the correct dose for administration.
Hold the syringe with your dominant hand and pull the needle cover off with your other hand. Pinch the skin with your non-dominant hand.

, Depending on the amount of skin you can pinch, you can insert the needle at either a 45 degree or 90 degree angle.Use a 45 degree angle if you can only pinch about one inch of skin.
If you can pinch two inches of skin, then insert the needle at a 90 degree angle.
Grasp the syringe tightly and use a quick motion of your wrist to puncture the skin with the needle.
Insert the needle quickly and carefully at the determined angle with your dominant hand while pinching the skin with your other hand. Quick needle insertion helps prevent the patient from becoming tense.
Aspiration for a SQ injection is not necessary. There is no harm in doing so unless you are administering blood thinning agents, such as enoxaparin sodium.
To aspirate, pull the plunger back slightly and check for the appearance of blood in the syringe. If there is blood, then remove the needle and find a different spot to administer the injection. If no blood is found, continue., Push the plunger down until all the fluid has been released.


Remove the needle. Push down on the skin above the injection site and use a quick and careful motion to remove the needle in the same angle in which it was administered.
The whole process doesn't need to take more than five or ten seconds.
Discard all used sharps in a sharps container.

, Insulin injections are given SQ but require different syringes to be sure each dose is accurate Plus, insulin administration is ongoing. Keeping a record of injection sites is an important part of insulin administration that helps you to rotate your sites.Recognize the difference in syringes. Using a regular syringe can cause serious dosing errors.
Insulin syringes are graduated in units instead of cc’s or mls. It is critical that you use an insulin syringe when giving insulin.
Check with your doctor or pharmacist to be sure you understand which type of insulin syringe to use with your prescribed insulin type and dosage.

Determine the injection site.,
Give the injection into the thigh.,
Use the ventrogluteal muscle.,
Give the injection into the buttocks.,
Administer the injection in the upper arm.,
Clean the skin on and around the site with an alcohol wipe.,
Insert the needle.,
Carefully inject the medicine into the patient.",How to Give an Injection3," An intramuscular injection (IM) delivers medication directly into a muscle. Choose an injection site that has easy access to muscle tissue.There are four primary sites recommended for administering IM injections. Those include the thigh, the hip, the buttocks, and the upper arm.
Alternate between injection sites to prevent bruising, soreness, scarring, and skin changes.

, The vastus lateralis is the name of the muscle that you will be targeting for your medication delivery site.Visually divide the thigh into three sections. The middle section is the target for the IM injection.
This is a good site if you are giving yourself an IM injection since you can easily see and reach the target area.

, This muscle is located in the hip. Use landmarks on the body to find the location where you want to inject the medication.Find the proper location by having the person lie on his or her side. Place the heel of your hand on the upper and outer part of the thigh where it joins the buttocks.
Point your fingers toward the person’s head and point your thumb towards the groin.
You should feel a bone along the tips of your ring finger and little finger.
Form a V shape by moving your pointer finger away from the other fingers. The injection is given in the middle part of the V shape.

, The dorsogluteal muscle is the area where you want to inject the medication. With practice the target area becomes easier to locate, but begin by using physical landmarks and divide the area into quadrants to be sure you have the correct area.Draw an imaginary line, or actual line using an alcohol wipe if available, from the top of the crack to the side of the body. Locate the midpoint of that line, and move up three inches.
Draw another line that crossed the first one, forming a cross.
Locate a curved bone in the upper outer square or quadrant. The injection should be given in the upper outer square below the curved bone.

, The deltoid muscle is located in the upper arm and is a good site for IM injections if there is adequate muscle tissue. Use an alternate site if the person is thin or has little muscle in that area.Find the acromion process, or the bone that crosses the upper arm.
Draw an imaginary upside down triangle with the bone as the base and the point of the triangle is the level of the armpit.
Give the injection in the middle of the triangle, one to two inches below the acromion process.

, Allow the alcohol to dry before administering the injection.Do not touch the cleaned area with your fingers or any other material before giving the injection.
Hold the syringe firmly with your dominant hand and remove the needle cover with your other hand.
Put pressure on the skin where you are giving the injection. Push down gently and pull the skin so it is tight.

, Use your wrist to inject the needle through the skin at a 90 degree angle. You will need to force the needle deep enough to be sure you deliver the medication into muscle tissue. Selecting the correct needle length helps to guide you in the injection process.Aspirate by pulling the plunger back slightly. Look for blood that is pulled back into the syringe as you pull back on the plunger.
If there is blood, then carefully remove the needle and find a different spot to administer the injection. If no blood is seen then continue with giving the injection., Push the plunger down until all of the fluid has been released.Do not push too hard on the plunger as this forces the medication into the site too fast. Push the plunger in a steady but slow manner to reduce pain.
Remove the needle in the same angle in which it was injected.
Cover the injection site with a small gauze pad or a cotton ball and a band-aid, and check on it regularly. Make sure it looks clean and the injection site is not continuing to bleed.

"
"
Watch for an allergic reaction.,
Seek medical attention if you develop an infection.,
Monitor the injection site.,
Dispose of used items safely.",How to Give an Injection4," Any new medication should be first administered in a physician's office so the patient can be monitored for allergy signs and symptoms. However, if signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction develop during subsequent treatments, seek medical attention immediately.Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, a rash or itching; shortness of breath; difficulty swallowing; feeling like your throat or airway is closing; and swelling of the mouth, lips, or face.
Call 911 if symptoms of an allergic reaction develop. You have just injected a medication into the body which speeds up the reaction time if an allergy is present.

, Even the best injection technique can sometimes allow entry of contaminants.Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you develop a fever, flu-like symptoms, headache, sore throat, joint and muscle aches, and gastrointestinal problems.
Other symptoms that warrant prompt medical attention include chest tightness, nasal congestion or stuffiness, a widespread rash, and mental changes like confusion or disorientation.

, Watch for changes in skin tissue at the point of injection and the area immediately surrounding it.Injection site reactions are more common with some drugs than others. Read the product literature before drug administration to know what to look for.
Common reactions that occur at the site of an injection include redness in the area, swelling, itching, bruising, and sometimes a raised lump or hardened area.
Alternating injection sites can help to minimize damage to the skin and surrounding tissue when frequent injections are needed.
Persistent problems with injection site reactions warrant medical evaluation.

, Sharps containers are a safe way to dispose of used lancets, syringes, and needles. Sharps containers can be purchased at your local pharmacy and are available online.Never put lancets, syringes, or needles in the regular trash.
Review your state’s guidelines. Your pharmacist can help you to find a program that meets your needs. Many states have clear guidelines and suggestions on developing a safe system for disposing of biohazardous waste created from giving injections at home.
Sharps, including used needles, lancets, and syringes, are biohazardous waste since they are contaminated with skin and blood from direct contact with you or the person receiving the injections.
Consider an arrangement with a company that provides mailback kits. Some companies provide a service that supplies you with sharps containers you need and make arrangements that allow you to safely mail the containers to them when they are full. The company takes responsibility for proper destruction of biohazardous waste.Ask your pharmacy about safe ways to discard any vials that contain unused medications. Often, any opened vials of medication can be placed into the sharps container.

Don't take the pharmacy's price at face value.,
Try mail-order.,
Try a different insurance plan.",How to Lower Your Epipen Costs2," Not every pharmacy will charge you the same for the EpiPen or the generic version. You can call around to see what the cost to you would be, though you can also use comparison search engines like GoodRx to help find the lowest price., Sometimes, using a mail-order company can make the price cheaper. Of course, you want to make sure the company you are ordering from is legitimate and in the country you reside in. Nonetheless, ordering by mail can sometimes be cheaper., While this solution isn't a great first option, it can help if you absolutely cannot afford the medication. On a different plan, the medication may be more affordable, providing relief for your family."
"
Ask your doctor or child's doctor if there's assistance.,
Go to your employer.,
Consider ordering directly from the company.",How to Lower Your Epipen Costs3," Sometimes, the doctor's office you visit may have assistance for people who can't afford a medication. If it's your child who needs the EpiPen, you may have better luck asking at a children's hospital., Most companies want their employees to be happy and healthy. If you talk to your employer about needing an EpiPen, they may be willing to help if your insurance doesn't cover it. This tactic may work better with more well-established companies., In some cases, ordering from the company may be cheaper than buying from a local pharmacy. When buying directly from the company, you cut out distributors and pharmacies, which can reduce your cost."
"
Locate the injection kit.,
Remove the packaging.,
Prepare the medication.,
Follow the instructions to prepare whichever drug formulation you have been supplied with.If you don't have an amp snap, wrap a bit of tissue around the neck of the glass vial to reduce the risk of glass cuts.

,
Draw the liquid injectable hydrocortisone medication from its ampoule or bottle into the syringe.,
Remove any air bubbles from the syringe.",How to Give an Emergency Injection of Hydrocortisone2," The injection kit will contain: an integrated safety syringe, or separate syringes and needles, ampoules of your injectable hydrocortisone, alcohol wipes or tissue, preferably also with an amp snap for opening glass vials. You must have at least 2 vials of injectable drug, in case of breakages.


The needles should be a suitable length for IM use, ie blue or green. If you have shorter, orange needles, which are usually for use in diabetes, it is best to inject in the upper arm. The most common hydrocortisone injectable drugs for steroid-dependence are hydrocortisone sodium phosphate and hydrocortisone sodium succinate.
Acetate-based hydrocortisone injection preparations such as Cortistab® are for joint injections only and should be avoided. They are too slow acting to do any good.

, For separate needles and syringe, attach the needle to the syringe by pushing them together.

, If you have been issued hydrocortisone sodium phosphate as a liquid then the ampoule will already be pre-mixed and ready to administer. However, in some countries, hydrocortisone sodium phosphate is supplied as a separate powder and water, similar to hydrocortisone sodium succinate.


If you have been issued with separate power and water, you will need to prepare the medication. Within North America and many countries in Europe, this is now supplied in an Act-o-Vial, a 2-chamber bottle. In other countries it is issued as a rubber-stoppered bottle containing the powder, and a separate water ampoule.
Double check your measurements and how much hydrocortisone you're getting. For example, Act-o-Vial contains 2ml water, so that 2ml = 100mg hydrocortisone and 1ml = 50mg, which is the recommended dose for 1-5 year olds. In comparison, the liquid preparation that is the drug of choice in the UK (hydrocortisone sodium phosphate) is pre-mixed in just 1ml, so that 1ml = 100mg hydrocortisone.

,, If you have a bottle with the hydrocortisone sodium succinate, it is best to hold this upside down while you draw up the liquid. If you are treating a child, check that you have the correct dose for their age or weight. For children over the age of five years, and for adults, the dose is usually 100mg hydrocortisone.

, Hold the syringe at eye level and check for bubbles by gently tapping it. If you see what look like little bubbles, this is trapped air. For an IM injection, it does not matter so much if a little air remains in the mix, although it is best to expel it before injecting. You can expel any air bubbles by gentle pressing the plunger (top of the syringe) down until a drop of liquid forms on the top of the needle.

"
"
Recognize the signs early.,
Always wear a medical bracelet explaining your steroid-dependent condition.",How to Give an Emergency Injection of Hydrocortisone3," If you are feeling increasingly weak and nauseous, it is often prudent to prepare a syringe before the onset of vomiting. The cost if it goes unused is minimal compared to the costs of emergency medical treatment.


In general, anyone who is steroid-dependent should receive a hydrocortisone injection immediately after vomiting. There are risks to delayed treatment., If your condition reaches the point that you are unable to communicate, you'll want a bracelet that indicates your steroid-dependent condition so whoever finds you, be it an ambulance or stranger, can give you the correct medical treatment.

Dispose of the cotton balls, needle and syringe appropriately in designated medical waste containers (sharps bin).",How to Give a Shot," Shots penetrate the body's most important defense against disease - the skin. Because of this, care must be taken to prevent the transmission of germs that cause infection. Begin by washing the area where you will set your materials with soap and water. Wash, dry, and disinfect your hands thoroughly.;
, On a clean, sterilized tray, table, or counter top, lay out the drug to be injected, cotton balls, bandages, alcohol wipes, and a sealed disposable syringe with an unused needle. Additionally, make sure you have a dedicated sharps/biohazard disposal container nearby.


You may want to lay down a sterile paper liner beforehand for ease of clean-up.
One trick physicians use is to set their tools in the order they'll use them in. In this case, you would set your alcohol wipes closest to you, followed by the medicine, the syringe and needle, then, finally, cotton balls and/or bandages.

, Even though your hands have already been carefully washed, as an added precaution, it's wise to wear sterile disposable gloves. If, at any point, you touch an unclean object or surface, rub your eye, itch yourself, etc., discard and replace your gloves.

, Some medicines can have very precise dosages, which, if exceeded, can cause side effects or even serious problems. Before proceeding, make sure you know exactly how much medicine you'll be administering in the shot - this information should have been provided by the physician and/or included on the prescription.


Also, make sure your syringe is large enough to accommodate your dose and that you have enough medicine to give a full dose.

, Because subcutaneous injections are given into the fatty layer beneath the skin, choose an area where fatty tissue accumulates. These locations include the backs of your arms, your sides, your lower belly (at least an inch from the belly button) and your thighs.


Pick a spot that is at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the location of your last injection, especially if you receive frequent injections. This safety practice is called ""rotation"". Rotation is done to avoid lipodystrophy, a condition where continuous shots administered in the same area lead to lumpy, damaged flesh in the localized area.

Rotation is very important for diabetic patients because it's easy for lipodystrophy to occur with repeated insulin injections, as the repeated absorption of insulin causes shrinking of the fatty tissue at the site, leading to divots in the skin. This is not reversible, so the best treatment for this common complication is prevention. , Usually, medications given via subcutaneous injection come in small vials with an outer lid and an inner rubber diaphragm. Take the lid off of the vial and disinfect the rubber top with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol or an alcohol wipe.

, Modern subcutaneous injections are given with sealed, disposable needles to lessen the chance of infection. Remove your needle and syringe from its casing. From this point on, handle the needle and syringe with care. If the needle touches anything that hasn't been sterilized, don't risk infection by proceeding to use it for the injection. Instead, replace it with a new one.


If your syringe doesn't come with the needle attached, you may need to gently insert and/or screw the needle onto the end of the syringe. Do this before removing the needle's cap.

, Grasp the needle's protective cap by pulling firmly outward. Do not touch the needle now or at any point during the following steps. Handle the needle with care.

, The barrel of the syringe has dosage measurements on the side - line the plunger up with the precise measurement for your dosage. As you do this, air will be drawn into the syringe.

, Set the vial on a flat surface and carefully stab the needle through the vial's rubber diaphragm so that the needle's point is inside the vial.

, Push down on the plunger - do this gently, but definitively. Do not leave any air in the syringe. This action pushes air into the vial.


Adding air to the vial serves an important purpose - by putting air in the vial, you increase the air pressure in the vial, which makes it easier to draw the correct dose because the extra air helps ""push"" the liquid out.

, Carefully hold the vial in one hand and the syringe in the other. Turn the vial upside down in the air with the needle still inside. The syringe should be beneath the upside-down vial with its needle pointing up into it.

, Pull the plunger toward you to fill the syringe with your prescribed dosage. Make minute adjustments as necessary by gently pushing or pulling on the plunger to ensure the amount of medicine in the syringe is exactly correct.


When you're done, take the needle out of the vial. Set the vial aside for future doses or dispose of it in a proper medical waste receptacle.

, Injecting air bubbles into the body can put you at risk for a condition called a gas embolism, which, though rare, can be potentially life-threatening. Because of this, it's important to ensure there are no bubbles in the syringe before giving an injection. This is done in a process called aspiration. Hold the syringe needle-up and flick the side of the syringe to cause any bubbles to float to the top. When you've dislodged all the bubbles in the syringe, gently depress the plunger until all the air leaves the syringe. You can stop when you see a tiny drop of liquid emerge from the tip of the needle.

, Wipe your chosen injection site with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol or with a sterile, pre-packaged alcohol wipe. Alcohol kills germs and microorganisms on the skin, reducing the risk that the needle will carry them under the skin.


When giving frequent injections in a specific location of the body, do not sterilize the skin because it can cause the skin to dry out. Only sterilize if there are visible impurities.

, Use your other hand to pinch your flesh where the shot will be given. This causes a ""bulge"" in the fatty tissue, which gives you a thicker area to safely inject into.

, Quickly, so as to avoid prolonging pain, but not violently, hold the needle like a dart and plunge the needle into the spot you've pinched.


You can also insert the needle in a 90 degree position, or a right angle. However, for small children or patients with little subcutaneous fat, a 45 degree angle is preferred because a 90 degree angle may cause the needle to go too deep, hitting the patient's muscle., Release the skin from your pinch grasp. Pull back on the plunger with the needle in your skin. If you draw blood into your syringe, start over and choose a different injection site, as this signifies you've hit a vein or artery. Subcutaneous drugs are meant to be administered into fatty tissue - releasing them directly into the bloodstream can cause them to be released too fast.

, Release the drug into the subcutaneous layer by slowly pushing down on the plunger. Push at a steady, controlled pace. Some minor discomfort is normal at this point.

, Gently but confidently pull the needle out of your skin. As you do so, you may want to press around the injection site with a clean cotton ball - this can prevent the skin from being pulled up with the needle, which can be painful.

, Apply a dry cotton ball to your injection wound. If desired, you may use a bandage to hold this against your wound, or you may hold it in place yourself, taking care not to touch your wound, and discard it when bleeding stops.

, Clean your work area and put away your tools.


Never throw out medical waste, especially not needles, with normal garbage. Doing so can spread potentially deadly blood-borne illnesses.
Dispose of your sharps bin at a pharmacy.

Dispose of the needle properly.,
Use the disposable needle only once.",How to Give a B12 Injection," Talk to your doctor about why vitamin B12 injections may be a good treatment for you. Your doctor will want to run some tests to check the levels of B12 in your blood and potentially some other lab work. If your doctor feels you are a good candidate for vitamin B12 injections, she will give you a prescription for a certain dosage. She should also teach you how to perform the injection, or show the person who will be doing the injections for you. You should not attempt to administer these shots without proper training.


You will then need to fill your prescription at your local pharmacy. Never take more than the prescribed amount of vitamin B12.
While using vitamin B12 injections, your doctor may require regular blood tests to check your body's reaction to the injections.;
, Talk to your doctor about allergies and other conditions which may make you ineligible for a B12 shot. Because vitamin B12 injections contain cyanocobalamin, you should not use this medication if you are allergic to cyanocobalamin or cobalt, or if you have Leber’s disease, which is an inherited form of vision loss. You should not get the shot if you have any of the following:Cold or allergy symptoms that affect your nose, such as sinus congestion or sneezing.
Kidney or liver disease.
Iron or folic acid deficiency.
Any type of infection.
If you are receiving any medication or treatments that affects your bone marrow.
If you are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant while using vitamin B12 injections. Cyanocobalamin can pass into your breast milk and may harm a nursing baby.

, If you suffer from anemia or a vitamin B12 deficiency, you may need vitamin B12 injections as a form of treatment. Some people also have difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 in food or through oral vitamin B12 supplements and resort to injections of vitamin B12. Vegetarians who do not consume any animal foods may also benefit from vitamin B12 supplements to ensure they remain healthy.However, keep in mind vitamin B12 injections are not medically proven to help with weight loss., The ideal injection site depends on your age and the comfort level of the person administering the injection. A healthcare professional should administer your first shot so that he can monitor your reaction and check for any adverse effects. There are four common injection sites:The upper arm: This site is often used for adults who are young or middle aged. Older adults can use this site if the muscle in their upper arm, their deltoid, is well developed. However, doses higher than 1mL should not be administered via the upper arm.
The thigh: This is the most common site used by people who are self-administering the injections, or giving an injection to an infant or a small child. It’s a good spot because of the high amount of fat and muscle under the skin of your thigh. The target muscle, vastus lateralis, is halfway between your groin and your knee, about 6–8 inches from the crease of your leg.
The outer hip: This site, located on side of your body below your hip bone, is good for young people and adults. Most professionals advise using this area as there are no major blood vessels or nerves that could be punctured due to the injection.
The buttocks: Your upper, outer buttocks, or Dorsogluteals, on either side of your body, are common injection sites. Only a medical professional should use this site, as it is located close to major blood vessels and your sciatic nerve, which could be damaged if the injection is not administered properly.

, Though it may seem like a pretty straightforward process to inject someone with a needle and a plunger, there are two injection methods that can be used for a vitamin B12 injection:Intramuscular: These injections are more common, as they tend to have better results. The needle will be inserted at a 90 degree angle, which will put the needle deep into the muscular tissue. Once the needle is in the muscle, the plunger should be pulled back slightly to ensure the needle is not in a blood vessel; if no blood is aspirated, then the medication can be pushed through slowly. When the vitamin B12 is pushed through the needle, it will absorbed by the surrounding muscle right away. This will ensure all of the B12 is absorbed into your body.
Subcutaneous: These injections are less common. The needle will be inserted at a 45 degree angle, just below your skin, as opposed to deep in your muscle. The outer skin may be pulled away from the muscle tissue to ensure the needle does not pierce the muscle. The best site for this type of injection is your upper arm.

, Prepare a home treatment area on a clean counter of your home or space. You will need:Prescribed vitamin B12 solution.
A covered clean needle and syringe.
Cotton balls.
Rubbing alcohol.
Small band aids.
A puncture-proof container to dispose of the used needle.

, Make sure the chosen injection site is uncovered and the person’s bare skin is exposed. Then, dip a cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol. Clean the person’s skin using the cotton ball in a circular motion.


Allow the site to dry.

, Use a new cotton ball, dipped in rubbing alcohol, to wipe the surface of the container with the B12 solution.


Let this dry.

, Remove the clean needle from the package and take off the safety cover on the needle., Then, insert it into the vial. Push the air out of the syringe by pushing the plunger, and then slowly pull back on the plunger, until the syringe fills to the required amount.Tap the syringe lightly with your finger to remove any air bubbles in the syringe.

, Give a slight push on the syringe to dispel a tiny amount of the vitamin B12 supplement to ensure the air is out of the syringe., Use the thumb and forefinger of your free hand to hold the skin of the injection site taunt. No matter where the chosen injection is located on the person’s body, the skin should be smooth and tight to make it easier to administer the supplement.Let the person know you are going to inject the supplement. Then, inject the needle into their skin at a right angle. Hold the needle steady and push down the plunger slowly until all of the supplement is inserted.
Once the needle is inserted, pull the plunger back a little to check that there is no blood in the syringe. If there is no blood, inject the supplement.Try to inject into relaxed muscles. If the person appears nervous or tense, tell them to keep their weight on the leg or arm you are not injecting into. This will help them keep the muscles by the injection site relaxed.If you are injecting the vitamin B12 into yourself, use your free hand to hold the skin of the injection site taunt. Relax your muscles and inject the needle at a right angle. Check that there is no blood in the syringe and then inject the rest of the supplement if there is no blood.

, Make sure you remove it at the same angle of insertion. Use a cotton ball to stop any bleeding and to clean the injection site.


Wipe the injection site in a circular motion.
Apply a band-aid to the site to keep the area protected.

, Do not throw used needles into your regular garbage. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for a puncture proof disposal container, such as a sharps container, or make your own container.


Use a coffee can and duct tape a lid on to it. Cut a slit in the lid that is wide enough for needles to fit through. Label the can. Once the can is full, take it to your doctor’s office for proper removal, or look into a biohazardous waste disposal service.
You can also use a thick plastic detergent bottle to store used needles (make sure this is labeled to reflect that it is now full of used needles, not detergent).

, Never use the same needle twice, as this can lead to infection or illness.You can store any unused vitamin B12 injections at room temperature, away from moisture, heat, and light.

When reading the directions on the kit, take time to familiarize yourself with the contents of the kit. It should include a needle, a syringe filled with liquid, and a vial full of powdered Glucagon.;
, If stored incorrectly (extreme heat or cold), Glucagon could turn into a gel or become clumpy. If you notice Glucagon powder is watery or the liquid in the syringe is cloudy, gelled, or has an inconsistent appearance, do not use it., After reading the directions, quickly check the expiration date of the Glucagon. It should be typed and located toward the bottom of the prescription information. If the Glucagon is expired, you should not use it., Before handling the syringe, needle, or vial, make sure you carefully wash your hands. In addition, if you happen to walk away and do something else, you’ll have to wash your hands again.

In an emergency situation, you many not be able to wash your hands; however, try to do so if it's possible.

, Carefully remove the cap from the syringe. Place it to the side and be careful not to prick yourself or to squirt out any of the liquid from the syringe., Firmly push the needle through the rubber stopper as far as it can go. The needle should be submerged and should be near the bottom of the vial.

It may help to place the vial on a table and hold it steady as you insert the needle into the rubber stopper., By pushing the plunger down, you’ll inject the liquid from the syringe into the vial. Make sure to inject all of it. As you inject it, the liquid will mix with the powder in the vial., Avoid being too rough with the needle and vial. Make sure, however, to thoroughly mix the powder and the liquid. If you don’t, the medicine may not be as effective as it needs to be.

You may want to hold the vial and syringe in one hand with the vial on top and gently shake it back-and-forth., By doing this, you’ll draw the Glucagon out of the vial into the syringe. Make sure the vial is on the top of the syringe and that you get the proper amount of medication out of the vial into the syringe.

Double check the amount of Glucagon the person has been prescribed. This is important, as giving them too much could cause their blood sugar to rise too high., Decide on an injection site. The most common sites are the thighs and buttocks. The specific location depends on what is easier to access and on the preference of the patient. Once you’ve chosen a site, use an alcohol swab to clean it.

If you don’t have an alcohol swab, you can proceed without it., Push the plunger (with your thumb) all the way down. Do this quickly and without pause and make sure all the medication is injected steadily. Make sure the needle and syringe is positioned at a 90-degree angle., After you’ve injected the Glucagon, pull straight up and withdraw the needle from the skin in a smooth fashion., If the person is unable to move, you should turn them on their side. This is important, as the person could vomit after receiving the injection. This will prevent them from choking on their vomit., After attending to the person, you should immediately call emergency services. This is important, as the medicine is just a measure intended to stabilize their blood sugar. The likelihood is that the person will need further medical treatment.

Let emergency services know the result of the blood sugar test. In addition, let them know what the person ate or drank after taking the Glucagon., Using a blood sugar tester, prick their finger, and find out their blood sugar level. By checking their blood sugar, you’ll get an idea of whether the medicine had its desired effect. Their blood sugar should move up to 70 mg/dl or higher.

The person should be conscious after 15 minutes. If they are not, provide another glucagon injection if one is available., Instruct the person to drink a fast metabolizing sugary drink as quickly as they can. Such drinks include soda, fruit juice, or something similar. This will further help raise and stabilize their blood sugar.If the person has fainted, wait for them to wake up. This could take 5 to 10 minutes.
Only give a drink to someone who is alert enough to swallow; otherwise, they could choke.

, In addition to drinking a sugary drink, the person should eat a long-acting source of sugar, too. Such foods may include carb rich foods like crackers, cheese, or a meaty sandwich. This will further help stabilize their blood sugar level.

The person should avoid sources of sugar that the body will metabolize and run through quickly, like candy bars.Make sure that the person is alert enough to eat.

, If the person is still unconscious and paramedics have not arrived within 5 to 10 minutes, you should give them another shot of glucagon. This is because the first injection may not have done enough to raise the person's blood sugar level.

If you remain on the phone with emergency services, inform them before giving another injection of Glucagon."

Find out where you're getting the injection.,
Stroke the skin and apply pressure near the injection site.,
Start preparing in the waiting room.,
Focus your attention elsewhere.,
Do not look at the needle.,
Hold your breath.,
Normalize the fear.,
Do not tighten your muscles.,
Talk to your nurse about your apprehension.,
Place a warm washcloth on the injection site.,
Massage or rub the site.,
Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen.,
Use the body part that received the injection.",How to Get an Injection Without It Hurting," Preparation for the injection depends on where on the body it is administered. Many common injections, such as most vaccinations, are administered in the arm, while certain antibiotics may be administered to the back or the buttocks. Ask your doctor or nurse beforehand where you can expect the injection to be applied and treat that area accordingly.;
, Once you know where the injection will be applied, stroke the skin and apply pressure near where the needle will go in. This will prepare your body for the added pressure of a needle in that area, and the shock of the prick will be less harsh in the doctor's office. Do this shortly before leaving for your appointment or in the car or bus ride on the way over., While in the waiting room, certain tasks can help prepare for your injection and distract you from the potential pain.


Squeeze a stress ball. This eases up the muscles in preparation for an injection.
Listen to music, podcasts, or books on tape. While the doctor is not likely to let you put your headphones in during the appointment, listening to music beforehand can provide a distraction so you're not too apprehensive going in.Read a magazine or book. If you're more easily soothed by reading than listening, a good, distracting story or article can also be helpful while waiting for your appointment.

, Oftentimes, the anticipation and awareness can make the pain feel more acute. Focus your attention elsewhere while the shot is being administered to minimize pain.


Pretend you're somewhere else. Imagine you're soaking up the sun on a dream vacation or getting a cup of coffee with your friend. Have a variety of feel-good scenarios in mind before going in, and let your imagination flow.
Focus on another body part. Imagine the injection is going in a different spot than it is. This way, you're anticipating pain in another area and this distracts you from the actual injection.Recite a poem or song lyrics. If you have anything committed to memory, now is a good time for recital. Your energy and focus will be placed on remembering particular verses and words and not on the present moment.
If you happen to have a chatty doctor or nurse, engaging him in conversation before or during the injection can provide a needed distraction. The subject doesn't matter — just listening to him talk may divert your attention.

, Our expectations of pain can make it more intense. Recent scientific studies have provided empirical evidence that not seeing the needle during an injection makes it less painful. Do not look at the needle when receiving the shot. Either close your eyes or look away., Hold your breath a few seconds before the injection and while it is being administered. This increases blood pressure, which in turn decreases nervous system sensitivity. While the decrease in pain is somewhat slight, if coupled with other techniques holding your breath can help reduce pain., The stigma and apprehension over your fear of needles, injections, and pain can make you place disproportionate focus on the injection. The fact is, fearing needles is very normal. Knowing you are not alone, and that this fear is normal, can help you relax during the process., Tightening your muscles can make pain harsher, especially with intramuscular injections, so be sure to keep muscles loose. It is normal to tense up when scared, so certain techniques can help.



Breathing exercises, such as taking a deep breath, holding it in for 10 seconds, and then releasing it help if done shortly before the injection takes place.
Think, ""I am going to get an injection,"" rather than, ""This will not hurt."" The former helps you accept the inevitable, which can allow your body to relax rather than tense up in apprehension., Discuss any apprehensions you have about an injection with your nurse beforehand. Medical professionals are more than willing to help patients in need.


The nurse can give you a local anesthetic cream, which is placed on your arm to numb it and make the injection less painful. Ask before your appointment, as the cream takes up to an hour to work.
Nurses are also good at distracting patients and helping them relax. If you mention to your fear beforehand, he might be able to help you stay calm with relaxation techniques., Injection sites sometimes bother patients the next day, or even a few hours afterwards. If this is the case for you, run warm water over a washcloth and place it over the injection site. This should soothe the pain and provide some instant relief. , This will help disperse the medication and loosen the muscles.


There are two exceptions to this rule. Heparin and Lovenox injections should not be massaged afterwards, as this can lead to further soreness and bruising., A lot of post-injection pain comes from inflammation. Anti-inflammatory over-the-counter pain meds can help ease pain, swelling, and other discomforts., While it may be tempting to slow down and rest, this is sometimes counterproductive to pain reduction. Keeping in motion, especially if the injection was in your arm, can increase circulation and help you return to normal more quickly."

Get mentally prepared.,
Ask a friend to come with you.,
Be open with your health care provider.Tell him or her that you flat out don't like shots.,
Ask your doctor to prescribe EMLA cream before your shot.",How to Get a Shot1," Take a deep breath and think about how fast the time will go. To think positive thoughts, promise yourself a reward after the experience, like you might do for children. Go get that burger from your favorite restaurant, even if you're on a diet.


Remind yourself that the shot is going to help you in the long run. Whatever shot you're getting, it's for your own health.;
, Think of the person you most trust to comfort you and not make you feel ashamed of your fear. Ask him or her to come to the doctor's office with you and help you stay calm. They can hold your hand, talk you through your anxiety, or just listen to your concerns while you wait.


Bringing a childhood comfort toy, like a teddy bear, can also make the experience a lot more bearable. Don't be embarrassed about it — do whatever you need to make sure you go through with this shot.You might also listen to music on your phone or iPod to distract you while you wait. You can even do this while you're getting your shot!

, Talking about your fear will both make you feel better and let the person giving you the shot know that they need to be more cautious with you.


Ask them to give you the shot in whichever way causes you the least stress. You might ask the provider to count to three before giving you the shot, so you’ll know it’s coming. Or, you might want to look away and have him give the shot without warning.
Understanding how the shot will help might set your mind at ease. Ask the provider to tell you how it will make your life better. You can request a handout with information about the shot, as well., This prescription lidocaine cream numbs the skin, so you won't be able to feel the injection. When patients use EMLA cream, the feel less pain and anxiety while getting shots.


Adults: Apply 2.5g of the cream to a 7-10 inch (20-25 cm) area of skin on the upper arm/shoulder, where you'll get the shot. Cover it up with a bandage, and leave the cream on your skin for at least an hour.Children: ask your doctor whether you should use EMLA cream on your child.
Side effects include pain, swelling, burning, redness, paleness, and temperature sensation change.

"
"
Distract yourself with positive thoughts during the shot.,
Avoid looking at the needle.,
Relax your arm completely before getting the shot.,
Be conscious of your breathing.,
Move your arm immediately after the shot.By working the muscles at the injection site immediately, you increase blood flow to the area.,
Do not take a painkiller to relieve the pain.",How to Get a Shot2," Think of something that always makes you laugh, or recall your happiest memory. One recent study even showed that thinking about butterflies, flowers, fish, and smiley faces relaxed people while getting shots., Seeing it might make you feel worse, especially in the moments leading up to and during the injection itself. Don't look at the supply tray or table, either! Just close your eyes and breathe., Practice dropping your shoulder and lightly pressing your elbow against your waist. Doing so relaxes the Deltoid muscle, where you usually get shots.Not only will the shot itself hurt less, but your arm will feel better more quickly than if you tense up during the injection.


Jumping in the middle of a shot can cause nerve pain, which leads to worse pain at the site of the injection.In fact, if you tense your body for an injection, you may experience pain in other areas as a result., Take a deep breath right before the shot, and exhale slowly during it. Slow, deep breathing temporarily helps with pain relief because it relaxes muscle tension. Also blowing in and out while the shot is given. Deep breathing also lowers blood pressure, balances Ph in our bodies, and helps in avoiding harmful stress hormones., This, in turn, speeds up the healing process. In the hours and days after your shot, keep moving your arm about to speed up the recovery process.

, A recent study showed that pain killers such as Ibuprofen, Advil or naproxen taken just after the HPV vaccine reduced the shot's effectiveness.Researchers believe other vaccinations may respond the same way. The painkiller causes the body to build up antibodies that work against the vaccine. To avoid this, just deal with whatever pain you're feeling. You can add an ice pack or cool compress for about 15 minutes to the injection site to relieve pain.You can get through it!

"
"
Empathize with your child.,
Try to breastfeed if you have an infant receiving the shot.,
Talk calmly with older children about getting the shot.,
Call the shot by a less frightening word.Young children (under 7) might associate the word ""shot"" with guns and serious injuries.,
Read a book about shots with your child.There are many educational children's books on the market that can set your child's mind at ease.,
Talk with the health care provider about ways to make it easier on the child.The person giving the shot can make a big difference in your child's experience.,
Talk to the doctor about EMLA numbing cream.As discussed in the previous section, EMLA is a numbing cream that can reduce pain if applied hours before the shot.,
Distract children during the shot.,
Be your child's best cheerleader during the shot.When the time comes, maintain a positive, cheerful attitude.,
Promise a reward for getting through it.When preparing them for their booster, tell children that there will be a prize on the other end of the doctor's visit.,
Be careful with pain relievers.",How to Get a Shot3," Even for adults, the thought of getting poked with a needle can be frightening. Kids, with their big imaginations, tend to be even more afraid. About 2-8% of children have an actual phobia of shots, but all kids need to feel compassion and care to face an injection.

, A recent study that examined ways to help babies in pain showed that breastfeeding reduces pain in infants.The familiar, soothing action helped calm infants down while they got shots. Their heart rates remained stable, and the babies did not tense up or cry. If breastfeeding is not an option for you, try one of the following with your infant:


Give him or her a pacifier to suck on
Provide soothing skin-to-skin contact
Swaddle the baby
Give him or her glucose water drops with a pacifier
Place a musical mobile 20-25 cm (8-10 inches) above the baby, Children learn from their parents, so don't put negative ideas about the shot in their heads. Talk to them about what will happen at the doctor’s office, but act like it's a normal part of life, not a big deal they should worry about. The more relaxed your attitude toward the shot is, the more relaxed your child will be when getting one., To avoid unnecessary anxiety, call the shot something more positive. ""Booster"" or ""super booster"" reframe the injection as something that will make them strong, not hurt them.

, One of the scariest things about getting a shot is not knowing what's going to happen. These books provide information about the process and can make children feel more secure.

, One successful strategy is to have the health care provider give the child a choice of how many boosters they want to receive. If your child is due for one shot, have them ask ""Do you want one or two boosters today?"" If your child is due for two shots, ask ""Do you want two or three?"" Children almost always choose the smaller number, and in doing so, feel like they had a say. If the health care provider gives them a choice in the matter, children relax and feel more in control of the situation.

, However, it doesn't always work perfectly, so your child might still feel some pain. It's a prescription cream, so talk to your pediatrician ahead of time about whether they recommend using EMLA on your child.

, Before getting the shot, talk to them about what they are going to hold, look at, or do during the shot to distract themselves. Some children may want to sing, while others might prefer to hold a bear or favorite blanket. Children sometimes find it calming to be quiet and look a parent in the eyes for comfort. Talking about what you're going to do ahead of time will help your child stay calm in the moment.


You can also distract the child by reading a book, playing music, or playing an educational game with him or her during the shot., If you show how worried you are about your child's reaction, chances are good that your child will pick up on your anxiety. Instead, be a good coach. Tell him or her that they're doing a great job, that you've never seen anyone be so good at the doctor's office before. Cheer them on: ""You can do it! You're doing great!""

, It might be as simple as a lollipop or ice cream cone, or you might go big with a trip to the zoo.


Don't tell them that the prize depends on whether they cry or not. Crying during the shot is alright. They just have to make it through the doctor's visit to get their reward.

, Doctors don't recommend giving children Tylenol before getting a shot. It's actually normal for the body to have a low-grade fever after a shot.Only if the fever rises above 101 °F (38.3 °C) should you use Tylenol to bring it down. A little bit of pain or fussiness after a shot is also normal, so don't use a pain reliever unless your child complains about a lot of pain.

Stay calm, all the way up to the time of the shot, even on your way to your doctor.,
Understand that it is just a shot.,
Once you arrive at the doctor's office, there are three simple time periods to remember: Before the shot, during the shot, and after the shot.",How to Cope With Having Injections," You can achieve this by listening to your favorite music, looking out the window, playing a Game Boy, or doing anything else that relaxes you.;
, You are not going to feel anything more than a little prick in your arm, and it is going to help you to stay healthy. Who wants to be home with the flu when their friends are out having fun?

,



Before the shot- In the waiting room, read a book, listen to calm and happy music, go online if you have a laptop, or do anything else that will get your mind off the shot. By entertaining yourself, you will feel much less tense. When you finally see the doctor, you can request to do the shot first to get it out of the way. After all, it could throw off your blood pressure if your heart is beating rapidly.

During the shot- Hold a parent's hand if you're a child. If you're an adult, you can still hold someone's hand if you wish, such as a nurse's. Don't look at the needle. Also, let your arm go floppy! If you tense up, it will be really painful. Clench the fist of the arm that is not getting the shot, and it will all be over in a matter of seconds.

After the shot- Give yourself a pat on the back! You have gotten your shots, and possibly even a lollipop. Treat yourself by going to get some ice cream or doing another activity you enjoy.

Lather your hands with soap and make sure you have made plenty of bubbles before rinsing well with warm water.,
Carefully fill the needle or syringe up to the amount of medicine needed.,
If you are not working in the area where the patient is waiting, you'll have to take the needle to the room he/she is in without dropping or contaminating it.,
Prepare the patient for the injection.,
Take a cotton swab and dampen it with alcohol.,
Dispose of the cotton swab without contaminating your hands.

,
Take the needle or syringe and hold it in the proper position so that you can perform the injection smoothly and quickly.,
Quickly press the top of the needle or syringe to inject the substance into the body as quickly and painlessly as possible.,
Gently but quickly pull the needle out without jerking or moving it around.,
Apply a bandage onto the injected spot.

",How to Do Injections," Be sure your hands are completely dry and try not to touch anything that may contaminate your hands before you prepare for the injection.;
, Make sure you are using a clean, new needle or syringe that has not been contaminated.


The syringe may be completely full or partially full.

, You can either hold it in your hand, or you can place it on a clean metal tray designed for this purpose.

, Tightly their arm with a tourniquet underneath the vein where you are planning to inject the medicine in. This will restrict blood flow through that vein and make it easier to see.

, Swab the vein and the area around it where you will be injecting the medicine.

,, If the patient appears nervous or scared, gently talk to them and distract them with friendly, soothing questions. While they are answering, smoothly poke the needle or syringe through the vein it is to be injected in. Do not make any sudden jerks or movements. At this point, it's best to have a supporting hand holding the patient's arm to keep them from moving it.


If the patient is a child, you can let him/her sit on his/her parent's lap to bring about a feeling of protection. If the patient's parent isn't in the room at the moment or the patient refuses to sit in his/her parent's lap (sometimes, the patient may feel embarrassed about needing such comfort), suggest that the patient looks away, unless if the patient is fascinated by having a needle injected into his/her arm.

, Keep talking to the patient and distracting them from the pain.

, Make sure you have pulled the needle out from the same angle you injected it in, or you may cause some pain.

Put all of your supplies away.",How to Give a Subcutaneous Injection," Performing a subcutaneous injection properly requires more than just a needle, syringe, and medicine. Before proceeding, make sure you have the following:


A sterile dose of your medication or vaccine (usually in a small, labeled vial)
A suitable syringe with a sterile needle tip. Depending on the size of your patient and the amount of medication to be administered, you may choose to use one of the following configurations or another safe, sterile means of injection:

A 0.5, 1, or 2 cc syringe with a 27-gauge needle
A 3 cc luer lock syringe (for large doses)
A pre-filled, disposable syringe


A container for safely disposing of your syringe.

A sterile gauze pad (usually 2 x 2 inch)
A sterile adhesive bandage (note - make sure the patient is not allergic to the adhesive, as can lead to irritation near the wound)
A clean towel;
, Most subcutaneously-injected medications are clear and come in similarly-sized containers. Thus, it's easy to get them mixed up. Double-check the medication's label to ensure you have the right medication and dosage before proceeding.


Note - some medication vials contain only a single dose, while some contain enough medication for multiple doses. Ensure you have enough medication to administer the recommended dose before continuing.

, When performing a subcutaneous injection, the less you have to come in to contact with un-sterilized materials, the better. Having all your tools laid out ahead of time in a clean, easily-accessible work area makes the process of injection quicker, easier, and more sanitary. Lay your towel on a clean surface within easy reach of your intended work site. Lay your tools on the towel.


Arrange your supplies on the towel in the order you will need them. Note: You can make a small tear in the edge of your alcohol wipe packages (one that doesn't puncture the inner pocket containing the alcohol wipe) to make them easier to quickly open when you need them.

, Subcutaneous injections are meant to be given into the layer of fat below the skin. Certain areas of the body allow this fatty layer to be accessed more easily than others. Your medication may come with instructions about which specific injection site to use - check with your local health care professional or the medication's manufacturer if you are uncertain of where to administer your medication. Below is a common list of sites for subcutaneous injections:The fatty part of the tricep on the side and back of the arm between the elbow and shoulder
The fatty part of the leg on the outside front portion of the thigh between the hips/groin and knee
The fatty part of the frontal abdomen below the ribs, above the hips, and not directly adjacent to the belly button
Note: It's important to rotate injection sites, as repeated injections into the same location can cause scarring and hardening of the fatty tissue, making future injections more difficult and interfering with absorption of the medication.

, Using a fresh, sterile alcohol wipe, clean the injection site by gently wiping in a spiral motion from the center outward, being careful not to go back over already clean areas. Allow the site to air dry.


Before wiping, if necessary, expose the area of the body where the injection will be given by moving any clothing, jewelry, etc. away. This will not only make it easier to give the injection without obstruction, but also reduce the risk of infection from un-sterilized clothing coming into contact with the injection wound before it's bandaged.
If, at this point, you discover the skin at the injection site you've chosen is irritated, bruised, discolored, or distressed in any other way, pick a different site.

, Because subcutaneous injections pierce the skin, it's important for the person administering the injection to wash his or her hands. Washing kills any bacteria present on the hands, which, if accidentally transferred to the small wound caused by injection, can cause infection. After washing, dry thoroughly.


Be sure to wash methodically, ensuring all the surfaces of your hands receive soap and water. Studies have shown that the vast majority of adults don't wash their hands well enough to kill all bacteria., Set this on the towel. If this tab has already been removed, as in the case of multidose vials, wipe the vial's rubber diaphragm with a clean alcohol wipe.


Note - if you are using a pre-filled syringe, skip this step.

, Hold the syringe firmly in your dominant hand. Hold it like a pencil, with its (still capped) needle pointed up.


Though, at this point, you shouldn't have removed the syringe's cap, handle it carefully regardless.

, Grasp the cap over the needle with the thumb and forefinger of your other hand and pull the cap off the needle. Take care, from this point forward, not to allow the needle to touch anything except your patient's skin when s/he receives the injection. Lay the discarded cap on your towel.


You are now holding a small but extremely sharp needle - handle it with caution, never carelessly gesturing or making sudden movements with it.
Note - if you are using a pre-filled syringe, skip to the next section.

, Keeping the needle pointed up and away from you, use your non-dominant hand to pull the syringe's plunger, filling the syringe with air to the desired dosage.

, Carefully use your non-dominant hand to grab the vial of medication. Hold it upside down. Take extra care not to touch the vial's rubber diaphragm, which must stay sterile.

, At this point, your syringe should still contain air.

, The air should rise through the liquid medicine to the highest point of the vial. This serves two purposes - first, it empties your syringe, ensuring that no air bubbles will be administered along with the medicine. Second, it makes it easier to draw the medication into the syringe by increasing the air pressure in the vial.

, Making sure the needle tip is submerged in the liquid medicine and not the air pocket within the vial, pull back on the plunger slowly and gently until you have reached your desired dosage.


You may need to tap the sides of your syringe to force air bubbles to the top, then expel the air bubbles by gently pressing the plunger, forcing the air bubbles back into the medication vial.

, Repeat the process of drawing medication into your syringe and expelling air bubbles until you have the desired dose in your syringe with no air bubbles.


It's very important for there to be no air bubbles in the syringe when the medication is administered. Forcing an air bubble under the skin can cause a serious medical condition known as an embolism, which, though rare, can be fatal if the air bubble blocks blood flow to the heart, brain, or lungs., Place the vial back on your towel. Do not set your syringe down at this point, as doing so can contaminate your needle which can lead to infection.

, Hold the syringe in your hand as though you are holding a pencil or a dart. Make sure you can easily reach the syringe's plunger.

, Using your non-dominant hand, gather about 1 1⁄2 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm) of skin between your thumb and index finger creating a slight mound of skin, taking care not to bruise or damage the surrounding area. By bunching up the skin, you create a thicker area of fat for you to inject into, ensuring the entire dose is administered into the fat and not into the underlying muscle.


When gathering your skin, do not gather any muscle tissue. You should be able to feel the different between the soft upper fat layer and firmer, lower muscle tissue. Subcutaneous medications are not intended for injection into muscle and, if administered into muscle, may result in bleeding into the muscle tissue. This is especially true if the medication has blood thinning properties.

, With a slight snapping motion of your wrist, plunge the needle all the way into the skin. Usually, the needle should be inserted into the skin at 90 degrees (straight up and down, relative to the skin) to ensure that the medication is injected into the fatty tissue.However, for exceptionally thin or muscular people with little subcutaneous fat, you may need to insert the needle at a 45 degree angle (diagonally) to avoid injecting into muscle tissue.


Act quickly and firmly, but without jamming or stabbing the needle into the patient with excessive force. Hesitation may cause the needle to bounce off the skin or pierce the skin slowly, causing increased pain.

, Ease your grip on the patient's skin, allowing it to fall back to its natural position. Keep the needle submerged in the skin.
, Push down on the plunger without applying extra pressure onto the patient until all of the medication has been injected. Use one controlled, steady motion.

, This sterile material will soak up any bleeding that occurs after the needle is removed. The pressure you apply to the skin through the gauze or cotton will also prevent the needle from pulling on the skin as it's removed, which can be painful.

, Either gently hold the gauze or cotton ball in place over the wound or instruct the patient to do so. Do not rub or massage the injection site, as can cause bruising or bleeding under the skin.


At this point, you may secure the gauze or cotton to the patient's wound with a small adhesive bandage. However, because bleeding is likely to be minimal, you may also allow the patient to simply hold the gauze or cotton in place for a minute or two until bleeding stops. If using a bandage, make sure the patient isn't allergic to the adhesive.

, Carefully place your needle and syringe in a proper puncture-resistant sharps container. It's very important to ensure the needles aren't thrown out with the ""normal"" trash, as used needles can spread potentially deadly blood-borne illnesses.

, You have successfully completed your subcutaneous injection.

Disinfect shared surfaces and spaces often.",How to Administer a Flu Shot," The term ""pre-filled vaccine syringes"", in this case, is not referring to influenza vaccine syringes specifically manufactured as individual doses by the vaccine manufacturer, and, instead, refers to multiple, individual dose syringes filled from either single-dose or multi-dose vials before patients arrive at the clinic. If you are running a flu-shot clinic, try not to use pre-filled vaccine syringes. This can help avoid administration errors.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) suggests that the person who administers the vaccine should be the one who draws it from the vial.;
, Before administering the vaccine, you want to take several precautionary measures with the patient, including ensuring that he hasn't already had his annual vaccination. This can help ensure that the patient isn’t overexposed to the virus or has a history of bad reactions to the vaccine. Always inquire about allergies to avoid giving a medication to a patient with previous reactions. If the patient is unclear, request formal medical record. Always use two step identification process asking patient name and date of birth to ensure right patient it receiving the injection. Get a copy of the patient’s medical history. This can prevent medical errors.Ask the patient if he’s had a history of bad reactions to the flu shot. Fever, dizziness or muscle pain may are common side effects of receiving the flu shot and should go away with time. Signs of severe allergy can include difficulty breathing, hives, wheezing, weakness and dizziness or heart palpitations. These symptoms are serious and should be evaluated immediately.The Flublok influenza vaccine may be a good option for those people who have had allergic reactions in the past. It is prepared without the use of eggs, which can sometimes be the cause of an allergic reaction. It also does not use the actual flu virus itself to create a vaccine., Every person who receives a flu shot must receive this statement. It explains the type of vaccine they received and how it works to keep them safe and eliminate flu epidemics.Document the date you provided the patient with the statement. Write it in the patient's chart or other vaccination record, if available. Ask the patient if she has any questions before continuing on to administer the dosage. In the medical record, it is important to include the expiration date of vaccine and lot number in case this information is needed in the future.
The Centers for Disease Control also offers copies of the VIS on their website for informative purposes., Use soap and water to wash your hands before giving an injection of any kind. This can help prevent the spread of the flu virus or any other bacteria you or the patient may have.You don’t need special soap to clean your hands, any type will do; however, it is recommended to use an antibacterial soap if possible. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.If you like, use a hand sanitizer after you’ve washed your hands to kill any other bacteria you may have missed., Most flu vaccines are injected on the deltoid muscle of the right arm. Using a newly opened alcohol pad, lightly clean the deltoid area of the upper arm. This can help ensure the that no bacteria enters the injection site.Make sure to use single-dose alcohol pad.If the person has a large or especially hairy arm, consider using two alcohol pads to help ensure the deltoid area is clean.

, Choose a needle appropriate for the size of your patient. Make sure it is a single-use needle that was sealed prior to the vaccine, which can help prevent the spread of diseases.Use a needle 1 to 1.5"" (2.5 to 3.8 cm) in length for an adult who weighs 132 lbs (60 kg) or more. This is a standard-sized needle, 22 – 25 gauge.Use a needle 5/8"" (1.58 cm) in length for children and adults who weigh less than 132 lbs (60 kg). Stretch the skin tightly when using a smaller needle., Once you’ve selected the proper sized needle for your patient, place it on the syringe into which you will fill the vaccine. Make sure to select a new, single-use syringe to minimize the risk of infecting your patient with bacteria or other diseases., Using a vial of the flu vaccine, or TIV-IM, fill your syringe with the appropriate dosage for your patient. The patient's age determines the proper dosage amount.Give 0.25 mL (0.05 tsp) to children from 6 months to 35 months in age.Give 0.5 mL (0.1 tsp) to all patients older than 35 months.For adults age 65 years and older, you may give 0.5 mL of high-dose TIV-IM.If you do not have 0.5ml syringes, you may use two single 0.25ml syringes., Gather your patient’s deltoid muscle between your fingers and hold it somewhat tightly. Ask your patient which is his dominant hand, and inject the vaccine in the opposite arm to help prevent soreness.If this is your first time administering a flu shot, you should have a seasoned nurse is monitoring your technique.


Find the thickest part of the deltoid, which is often above the armpit and below the acromion, or top of the shoulder.Firmly guide the needle into deltoid in one smooth action. The should be at at a 90 degree angle to the skin.For a child under three, inject the shot into the outer quadricep muscle, because they do not have enough muscle in the deltoid area., Make sure to deliver the entire amount of vaccine in the syringe. Your patient needs the full dosage for optimum efficacy.If your patient is showing signs of discomfort, soothe or distract her by talking to her.

, Once you administer the entire dosage, take the needle out of your patient. Apply pressure to the injection site to minimize pain and cover with a bandage if necessary.Tell your patient that some soreness is normal and shouldn't be cause for alarm.Make sure to remove the needle and apply pressure simultaneously.You can choose to cover the injection site with a bandage if there is any bleeding. You may find that this also soothes many patients., Include the date and place of vaccination. The patient will need these records in the future, and you may, too, if you remain their primary caregiver. It can help ensure that the patient doesn’t get too many doses of or overexposure to the vaccine.

, For children between six months and eight years old, a second dose of the vaccine may be required four weeks after the first dose.If the child has never been vaccinated or his vaccination history is unknown, or if he has not received at least two doses of the vaccine before July 1, 2015, then he will need to follow up with a second shot., Tell your patient to be aware of any side effects from the vaccine such as fever or aches. Although most side effects will go away on their own, if they are serious or persistent, instruct your patient to contact you.Make sure you have emergency medical protocol available if a worst-case situation happens. In addition, have the patient's emergency contact information on hand.

, One of the most effective ways to prevent the flu is thorough and frequent hand-washing.This minimizes the spread of bacteria and the flu virus from surfaces that many people touch.Use a mild soap and water and wash your hands in warm water for at least 20 seconds.Use a hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available., If you have the flu, and out of common courtesy, cover both your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. If possible, cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your elbow to avoid contaminating your hands.Covering your nose and mouth minimizes the risk of spreading flu to those around you.
Make sure you are sanitizing your hand with a thorough hand-washing after you sneeze, cough, or blow your nose.

, The flu is very contagious and spreads most easily in places where crowds congregate. Staying away from crowded spaces can help minimize your risk of contracting the flu.Make sure to wash your hands after touching anything in crowded spaces, such as handles in public transportation.
If you have the flu, stay home for at least 24 hours to help minimize the risk of spreading the flu to others., Germs spread easily in places such as bathrooms or on kitchen surfaces. Cleaning and disinfecting these spaces frequently may help prevent spreading the flu virus."

Throw the syringe in the hazard container as well as any vial you have left open.",How to Administer an Injection from a Vial," Serious complications can usually occur if you don't choose the correct medicine. Make sure you have the correct:


Date on the label. Nothing expired is to be used.
The name of the medicine should be correct.
Check for foreign particles in medicine as well as change in color, and texture.;
,


Read instructions to see how much powder you have to mix  with liquid to use one dose.
Continue to follow the instructions until it it has transformed to liquid medicine.

,


Take the cap off of the vial.
Wipe the rubber top with an alcohol pad.

, You will use the syringe to give the injection.


With the cap on, pull back the plunger on the syringe to the amount of medicine you want to use.
This will allow you to suck air into the syringe.
Take off the cap and dispose of it into the hazard container.

, Perform this while the vial is faced straight upright.


Push needle straight into rubber top without bending the needle.
Press the plunger into the vial to release the air into it.

, Perform this while the vial is flipped upside down.


Keep syringe in vial.
Pull back plunger to the required amount of medicine needed.

, Keep the syringe inside the medicine vial while doing this step.


Tap the syringe to expose the air bubbles to surface of syringe.
Push plunger with minimum pressure to release air bubbles.
Make sure you did not reduce amount of medicine needed.

, If the vial has no more medicine, you may throw it away in the disposable hazard container

, Injections are usually placed into the subcutaneous layer of your body. This layer is between your skin and your muscles.


Look to inject the needle into the abdomen, thighs, or back of arms.
Find an area with good amount of fat to release your medicine into.
The location preferred by most nurses is the back of the arms since it is the easiest to access and it contains a good amount of fat.
You can choose other areas if you have already performed on the back of the arms recently.

, You do this by pinching the skin and determining how much fat you have in that area. Some areas have more fat than other areas. It is advised that you inject the area with the most fat. Some people do not have areas with much fat.


If about 2 inches or more fat is present when pinched, place the needle perpendicular to the skin. This is about 90 degrees to the skin.
If less than 2 inches of fat is present, you may need to adjust your angle of insertion to about 45 degrees.

, Some people are usually scared and start to shake as the needle is approaching. You may want to comfort them before injecting them. The steps of the injection include:


Rub the alcohol pad to clean the desired area for injection.
Pinch the area with your hand as mentioned in the previous step.
With your other hand, thrust the needle at an angle determined by the previous step into the area.
This is done by a quick motion of your wrist.

, This is the part we have all been waiting for. This step should take a little more than a few seconds. You have now inserted the needle into the skin and are ready to give the injection. While the needle is in the skin, make sure the plunger has not been pushed or damaged. If so, take the needle out and alert your primary physician.


Push the plunger to release all the medicine into the body.
Take the needle out and place an alcohol pad on top of the skin to take care of any blood.
Do not be alarmed if there is any blood since you are getting injected into your hypodermis. Veins and arteries are present there but you will not bleed for more than a few seconds.
Keep pressure on the area of injection with the alcohol pad until there is no blood coming out anymore.

Fill an old sock with uncooked rice.,
Consider adding lavender oil.,
Tie or sew shut the sock.,
Heat it up in the microwave.",How to Make a Heating Pad1," The most simple method for a reusable rice-filled heating pad. It just requires and old sock, some rice, a microwave and something to tie or sew the sock shut. First of all get hold a a good sized clean cotton sock that you won't miss, and then pour in the rice.


There is no fixed amount of rice to use, but it is recommended that the sock be at least half or three quarters full.Don't overfill it though. There should be a bit of flexibility so that the pad can rest comfortably on your skin.
You want it to be able to mold itself to the shape of your body a little.Some alternative fillings to rice include corn, barley, oatmeal and beans.;
, If you are making a heating pad to try to soothe your headaches, you can add some herbal ingredients to help. The most commonly cited extra ingredient is lavender oil. Simply mix in a few drops, 4-6, of essential 100% lavender oil in with your rice.It's best to mix this in before you put the rice in the sock.
Other suggestions for herbal additions include marjoram, rose petals, and rosemary.You can use dried herbs.

, Once you have added the rice, you need to secure it by closing up the sock. For those that are handy with a needle and thread, it'll be straight forward enough just the sew shut the open end of the sock.









An even easier option is just to tie off the end of sock.
Tie it as close to the end of the sock as possible.
Tie it as tight as you can as you don't want any rice slipping out., Now you have made your rice sock all you need to do is heat it up in the microwave. Simply put your secured sock in the microwave and heat it up. The length of time you will need to put it in for will depend on the size of sock and amount of rice you have used.


One and a half to two minutes should be long enough.Keep an eye on it and don't leave it unattended.
As a safety precaution you can put a cup of water in alongside the sock. If you have added dried herbs, this is a good idea."

Grab a zip-lock freezer bag.,
Pour rice into the bag.,
Pop it in the microwave.",How to Make a Heating Pad2," This is a very quick and easy way to make a heating pad. All you need is a zip-lock freezer bag, and some uncooked rice. Make sure the freezer bag is microwave safe, if not it'll melt and smoke and be a disaster. If you have just found a freezer bag around the kitchen and aren't sure if it's microwave safe, don't use it.

, Once you are certain you have a bag you can use in the microwave, pour in some rice. Fill the bag so that it is about three quarters full with uncooked rice and then secure it with the zip-lock across the top., Warm it up in the microwave for a minute, adding another seconds to a minute if necessary. Once it is heated up, take it out out the microwave and wrap it in a hand towel or other piece of insulating fabric.You don't want to put the heated bag directly onto your skin.

Get your chosen fabric.,
Cut it to size.,
Pin the two pieces of fabric together.,
Sew along the edges.,
Pour in the rice and sew it shut.",How to Make a Heating Pad3," You choose pretty much whatever you like to make the heating pad, but you will want to use a cotton fabric, such as a T-shirt or a pillowcase. Cotton is able to withstand high heats so this is the best choice for your fabric. Ask yourself if what you have chosen would handle being ironed a high heat as a basic guide to it's suitability.Make sure nobody is going to miss whatever you decide to use.

, In theory you could make your heating pad in whatever size or shape you like, providing it will fit in the microwave when you're done. The obvious shape to use would be a rectangle, but the same basic methods apply to whichever shape you opt for. Cut two pieces of fabric to your desired shape that are the same size.








If you using a rectangle something like a book can be a handy template.
You can use a plate for a circular one.
You can also use a sleeve from an old shirt., Once you have your two equal size and shape pieces of fabric you need to pin them together in preparation for sewing. You should have the side of the fabric you want to be displayed on the finished article facing inward now. When you sew it together it will be inside out.








Doing it this way means that the stitching will be more hidden and neater.

, Now you need to sew the two pieces of fabric together. You can do this either on a machine or by hand, whichever is best for you. Sew along the sides, but be sure to leave a gap of an inch or two on one side. You will need this to turn it the right way out, and to add the rice.








Push the fabric through this gap to turn it the right way out.
This might be a bit tricky, so be fairly careful, especially if your sewing isn't the best and could come loose.

, Now pour in the rice so it is around three quarters full. You might find it helpful to use a funnel to get the rice in, especially if the hole is small. Go ahead and sew shut the gap you left. Now your pad is full of rice it could be tricky to manoeuvre with a sewing machine, so you might find it easier to sew this bit by hand.

Use it for lower back pain.,
Use it for headaches.,
Use your heating pad for other aches and pains.,
Consider using it as a cold press.",How to Make a Heating Pad4," There is some evidence that adding heat to your lower back can help relieve pain there,as heat can release tension in muscles. To use your heating pad for this simply lay it on your lower back, or the part of your back which is sore. Leave it there for fifteen to twenty minutes., Heating pads can also be used for headaches and migraines in a similar way as for back pain. The heat relaxes tense muscles which can ease the pain in your head which is caused by a headache or migraine. Just place the pad on your head or neck to feel the benefits., As the heat from your heating pad relaxes muscles, you can use to it to relieve pain anywhere on your body that you feel discomfort or aching. Pads like this are often used to ease tense neck and shoulder muscles as well as back pain., You can also use the same heating pad as a cold press, simply by cooling it in the freezer first. There is less proof that cold will be as effective for lower back pain as heat will be.If you are using a plastic bag, be sure to wrap it in a towel before applying it to your skin.

Learn when moist heat is best.,
Apply a moistened towel.,
Steam a bag of vegetables.,
Fill a water bottle.,
Take a warm bath.",How to Make a Homemade Heating Pad1," There is some evidence that moist heat more effectively and quickly penetrates into deep tissues to help relieve pain. Fashion a moist heating pad for yourself if you need immediate relief because it’s most often used for shorter periods of time.Mix moist and dry heat throughout the day if you want.;
, The easiest way to relieve pain with moist heat is by using a pre-moistened towel or cloth. Apply the cloth to the area causing you pain.


Use a towel or washcloth depending on how large the area causing you pain is.
Run the cloth under what as hot as you can get it. You could also boil water and pour it over the cloth in a sink or bathtub to prevent burning yourself.
Wrap the cloth in another cloth and place the cloth directly on the area causing you pain. If it is too hot, either remove it, allow it to cool a bit, or wrap it in another cloth.Heat a moistened towel in the microwave for 45 seconds to a minute if you don’t want to use boiling water. Be careful when you remove it from the microwave.
Apply the pad for no more than 20 minutes at a time., Many companies now offer frozen vegetables that you can steam directly in the bag. Use your microwave to cook a bag of these vegetables and apply it to your sore muscles.


Choose a vegetable that can easily spread over any area where you have pain. Small vegetables or chopped vegetables such as peas, corn, mini carrots, or onions are good options.
Allow the vegetables to cool for a couple of minutes once they’re done steaming in the microwave. This will also let the steam settle and make the pad more moist.
Place a towel or cloth under the vegetables to avoid burning yourself.
Keep the bag of vegetables on your skin for up to 20 minutes., If you have a reusable water bottle or another container that won’t leak, fill it with warm to hot water.Apply it to the area causing you pain for up to 20 minutes.Avoid using boiling water, which may scald or burn your skin.
Place a cloth or towel between your bottle and skin to minimize the risk of burning yourself.

, Fill a warm bath to help you relax and relieve pain. Warm water can soothe muscles and get blood and oxygen flowing to help pain and promote healing.Direct any jets in your bath on the areas causing you pain.
If you don’t have a bath, take a shower and direct the warm water stream on areas causing you pain.
The water should be between 36 and 40 degrees Celsius to minimize the risk of scalding. Use a thermometer or check the temperature by slowly sticking your hand or foot in the waterAdd some Epsom salts to your bath, which can help relieve muscle pain.If you don’t have a bath, consider using the shower or a steam room.Stay in the bath or shower for up to 20 minutes."

Be aware when to use dry heat.,
Gather materials to make your pad.,
Put together your heating pad.,
Fill and seal the heating pad.,
Microwave your heating pad.,
Lay the pad on your skin.,
Repeat application.",How to Make a Homemade Heating Pad2," If you have chronic pain and don’t necessarily need immediate relief, consider applying a dry heating pad. Just like moist heat, dry heat can increase blood flow and oxygen supply and relax tender muscles. Unlike moist heat, you can apply dry heat for longer periods of time over the course of the day.Understand that using dry heating pads can dry out your skin.Use dry heating pads for up to 15 minutes every hour or two., You can easily fashion a dry heating pad with a few items you have around your house. You can either sew them into a proper heating pad for re-use or use it only while you’re experiencing pain. Gather the following items:


A piece of cloth such as a sock, pillowcase, or cloth bag. You can also take a handkerchief or washcloth and sew the ends together to make a pack.
Some type of filling such as rice, flaxseed, buckwheat, or oatmeal.
A needle and thread if sewing your pack.You can also add a soothing oil such as lavender essential oil to your pack. This can help you further relax., No matter what you’ve decided to use to fashion your heating pad, put it together before you use it. If you’re sewing one together from cloth, make sure to use tight stitches to minimize the risk of filling falling out.Check your cloth piece, tube sock, or pillowcase for holes. If you find any, either sew those or select a different type of pad to use.
Fold over the piece of cloth and sew together each side except one where so that you can add your filling. Make sure the stitches are close together and tight to prevent leaking., Once you’re heating pad is sewn or ready for use, add your selected filling. Make sure the pad is sealed tightly so that none of the filling can fall out.Use any type of filling you like. Rice, flax seed, buckwheat, and oatmeal are excellent options because they have small grains that can easily spread over a small or large area.You can also try dried beans such as pinto, kidney, or lentils.
Avoid overfilling the pad. Put enough in it to let it move across the area you want to heat. For example, you might want to put between 4 and 6 cups of uncooked rice in a large tube sock.Place a couple of drops of your favorite essential oil in the filling for a pleasant smell and the benefits of aromatherapy.Sew the unsealed end of the heating pad if fashioning your own from cloth or a pillowcase.
Close up a sock by knotting it at the open end.

, Place your heating pad in the microwave to warm up the filling.The heat from the filling can help relax your muscles and relieve tension.


Heat the filling in the microwave for 1-3 minutes. This can warm up the filling to a comfortable temperature for you and prevent it from exploding.Remove the pad slowly from the microwave to minimize the risk of burning yourself.
Allow the pad to cool if it is too hot or re-heat it if it isn’t warm enough.

, When the pad is at an optimal temperature for you, lay it on your skin. Place a thin cloth or towel under the pad to minimize your risk of burning yourself.Leave the heating pad on the area for treatment for no longer than 20 minutes., If you continue to have pain, you can repeat application of your dry heating pack every 1-2 hours for 15-20 minutes.Talk to your doctor if your pain persists for a long period of time.

Choose your hot water bottle.,
Unscrew the plug from the hot water bottle.,
Allow water to heat up.,
Fill your bottle with water, about two thirds full.,
Remove your bottle from the water source.,
Squeeze air from the water bottle.,
Screw the plug back into the hot water bottle.,
Place the bottle on your desired area.,
Empty your bottle after use.,
Ease menstrual cramps.,
Alleviate back pain or other aches.,
Treat headaches.,
Warm up in bed.",How to Fill a Hot Water Bottle," Hot water bottles are usually relatively similar, no matter the brand, and consist of a thickly lined, flat, often rubber water bottle, with some sort of padding or cover on the outside. Some bottles may have a thicker cover made out of a different material so choose one that works best for you. Make sure that you do buy a water bottle with a cover, as you need some separation between the direct heat from the water bottle and your skin.


Before you fill your water bottle, make sure the cover is already on the bottle. It may get a little wet, but if you try to hold your bottle without a cover while you are filling it up, the rubber may be too hot on your hands.;
, Your water bottle will most likely already be in it's cover, and will have a plug at the top of the bottle that prevents water from spilling out. Start by unscrewing the plug so that you can fill it with water.


If you water bottle has some water left in it, make sure you pour it out. You want to achieve the best heat from your water bottle, and using cooler, older water will make it harder for your hot water bottle to heat up.

, You can use water from your tap, but often times that doesn't get hot enough for your water bottle. However, boiling water from a tea kettle is much too hot for a water bottle. Try not to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 42 degrees Celsius with your water. If you are using a tea kettle, you can let the water boil and then allow it to sit for a few minutes. This will provide you with hot water, but it won't be too hot that it burns your skin.
Using water that is too hot can not only damage your skin, but it can decrease the life of you water bottle. The rubber that makes up hot water bottles can not withstand very hot water for a long time, so using water that is a temperature less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit is best for the life of your water bottle.
Different water bottles have different temperature requirements, so consult the instructions for your particular bottle before using it.

, This step must be done carefully, because you don't want to burn yourself with hot water. If you are using a tea kettle, slowly pour water into your hot water bottle, allowing it to fill about two thirds full. If you are using a faucet, turn it off once it becomes hot, then line the opening of the water bottle up with the faucet. Turn it back on slowly, so that the water pressure doesn't spray onto your hands.Make sure you hold the hot water bottle by the neck for the most stability. If you hold it by its body, the top may flop over before it is full, which will cause hot water to spill on your bottle and your hands.
You might consider wearing gloves, or some other protection on your hands in case you accidentally spill some of the water onto yourself. You can also prop your water bottle up so that it stands up by itself by placing items around it to hold it up -- that way you can pour your water into the bottle without the risk of harming your hands.

, Once your bottle is mostly filled up (you don't want it filled to the top because you'll need a little space to squeeze out some of the air and a full water bottle may spill easily) slowly turn your faucet off. Then carefully remove the bottle from under the faucet, making sure you don't spill any of the water.


If you are using a tea kettle, set the tea kettle down while holding the water bottle upright in your other hand, making sure you don't spill the water bottle or tilt it to the side.

, Make sure your water bottle is standing upright, with the bottom touching a flat surface. Then, slowly press the sides of the water bottle, expelling air from the bottle. Do this until you see the water in the bottle rise to the opening of the bottle., After you have expelled air from the water bottle, screw the topper back into the water bottle, making sure it is tight. Twist the plug until it can't be twisted anymore and then to test it, slowly turn the water bottle upside down to see if any water comes out., You may be using your water bottle to ease pain, or to provide warmth on a cold night. After you have filled it up, place your bottle on your body or in your bed and allow it to sit for 20 to 30 minutes. The bottle may take a few minutes to warm up, but shortly after you fill it, it should reach its maximum heat.Make sure you don't leave the hot water bottle on your body for longer than 30 minutes. Direct heat for a long period of time can be damaging to your body, so you want to be as safe as possible. If you are using the bottle to ease aches and are still experiencing pain after, take the bottle off after 30 minutes and then replace it again after waiting 10 minutes or so.
If you are placing your bottle in your bed, place it under you blankets 20 to 30 minutes before you crawl into bed. Then, when you go to bed, remove and empty out the water bottle. If you leave the water bottle in your bed while you sleep you run the risk of burning yourself or your sheets.

, Empty your water bottle out after the water has cooled and hang it upside down to dry, leaving the opening unplugged. Before using your water bottle again, check for leaks or damages by filling it with cold water.


Do not air your water bottle out in an area that experiences temperature fluctuations (such as above the stove), under the sink, or in direct sunlight as these can decrease the quality of your water bottle., A hot water bottle is very popular when it comes to alleviating cramps caused by your menstrual cycle. Heat can help block pain messages sent to the brain, by turning on the heat receptors in the affected area. These receptors prevent chemical messengers that cause pain to be detected in the body. So, if you are experiencing painful cramps, fill up a water bottle and place it on your lower abdominal area for thirty minutes or so., If you are experiencing back pain, or other aches in your joints or muscles, a hot water bottle can often help ease those tensions. Similarly to easing your cramps, heat on your affected areas inhibits pain messages from reaching the brain. It also helps stimulate blood flow, which brings healing nutrients to your achy areas.Often times a combination of cold and hot treatment can ease pain in your muscles as well. The contrast of the cold treatment and hot treatment causes stimulation and strong sensations without much movement, which is beneficial in easing pain. You can use just a hot water bottle, or you can alternate between placing an ice pack on your pain for a few minutes and then a hot water bottle., Heat can help relieve pain and muscle tension that may be causing your headache. Place a hot water bottle on your forehead, temples, or neck. Try out a few places to see which relieves the most tension and leave the heat source there for 20 to 30 minutes or until pain begins to subside., On those cold winter nights a hot water bottle can be just the trick to keep your feet or body warm. Place the hot water bottle at the end of your bed near your feet, or under your blankets near where you will lie so that your bedding warms up. Hot water bottles are also great if you are sick and experiencing frequent temperature changes in your body."

Most of these are minor bumps and bruises that don't require further medical attention. Some, like fractures, dislocations, and concussions , require emergency medical treatment. If you are at all unsure, visit the doctor or emergency room to receive the correct diagnosis and treatment.;
, A fracture is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. You can apply a cold compress to a broken bone to reduce swelling and pain. This should only be while you're waiting for help from a medical professional, and not in place of medical treatment. If you have any of the following symptoms, either call 911 or get to the emergency room:A deformed or misshapen body part. For example, a visible bend in the forearm would indicate a broken arm.
Severe pain that gets worse when the body part is moved or pressure is applied.
Loss of function in the injured area. Often the area below a broken bone will lose some or all motion. Someone with a broken leg may find it difficult to move his foot.
Bone protruding from the skin. Some serious fractures push the broken bone through the skin.

, A dislocation is when one or both of the bones that form a joint are forced from their normal positions. This also requires medical attention. You can apply a cold compress while waiting for medical help, just like with a broken bone. If you exhibit the following symptoms, keep the area immobile, apply a cold compress, and seek medical help:A visibly deformed or out of place joint.
Bruising or swelling around a joint.
Severe pain.
Immobility. It is often difficult or impossible to move areas below the dislocated joint.

, While ice packs are often applied for bumps and bruises on the head, you should make sure that you aren't suffering from a concussion. This is a serious injury that requires immediate medical attention. It may be difficult to evaluate yourself for a concussion, so someone else should check you for the following symptoms and seek medical help if a concussion is suspected:Loss of consciousness. Even if you only lose consciousness for a few seconds, this could be a sign of a serious injury and you should seek medical help immediately.
Severe headache.
Confusion, dizziness, and disorientation.
Nausea or vomiting.
Ringing in ears.
Slurred or labored speech.

, When you've properly evaluated the injury and ensured that there is no medical emergency, you can decide on the right course of treatment. For minor injuries, people often ask if heat or cold is the ideal treatment. Both are useful in different situations.Apply ice directly after an injury takes place. Usually within the first 48 hours of an injury, ice is the best treatment. It will help reduce swelling, pain, and signs of inflammation.
Heat is useful for sore muscles not associated with a specific injury. You can also apply heat to your muscles before an activity or sport that often makes you sore to loosen and warm them up.

, When it comes to cold compresses, you have several options. Some of these are available in in drug stores and some you can make yourself. While there are unique advantages and drawbacks to each, all work essentially the same way — by keeping an injury cold to prevent swelling and inflammation.


Gel-based ice packs. These are full of gel that stays cold when placed in the freezer. Typically these compresses get much colder than the other options since they stay in the freezer. They are also reusable, which is appealing for cost purposes. However, they generally can only be used at home since they start heating up when taken out of the freezer.Instant cold packs. These are filled with two different chemicals separated by plastic. When squeezed, the plastic breaks, causing the two chemicals to react and get cold. Unlike gel packs, these are portable and can be used anywhere as long as the chemicals haven't touched each other yet. This makes them ideal to have on hand for sporting events. They aren't reusable, however.Homemade ice bags. Take a large plastic bag and fill it with ice cubes. Then fill it with just enough water to cover the ice cubes. Squeeze out the air and seal the bag. These are good in a pinch if you don't have a store-bought ice pack. As drawbacks, they don't last as long and the condensation on the outside of the bag can get you wet.Ice towels. This is another homemade method you can use. Wet a towel and then wring it out so that it's just damp. Place it in a plastic bag and then leave it in the freezer for 15 minutes. You can then wrap it around the injured area. This option also won't last very long so you'll have to keep putting it in the freezer to keep it cold., This will help drain blood away from the area and fight swelling. Ideally, the body part should be lifted above the heart. So for example, if your wrist is injured, lie back on a coach and place your arm up on the high part.

, This is important because if the compress directly touches the skin, it can lead to frostbite. Make sure that for the entire duration of the treatment, the compress remains separated from the skin by a towel., Press it down to ensure that the entire affected area receives adequate icing.If necessary, you can secure the ice pack with a non-stick bandage or wrap. Loosely wrap this around the ice pack and the injured area. Be sure not to tie this too tight, or you could cut off circulation. If the limb starts to turn blue/purple, the wrap is too tight and should be removed immediately. Keep in mind that a tingling sensation does not necessarily indicate the wrap is too tight — this sensation may be caused by the injury itself.

, Don't leave it on any longer than this or you risk frostbite. Make certain that you don't fall asleep while wearing the compress, which could result in you keeping it on for several hours and damaging your skin. Either set an alarm or have someone alert you after 20 minutes.If you used a chemical cold pack, discard it after use. Check to see that your compress can be simply thrown away and does not contain materials that need to be disposed of in a specific way.
If you used a gel pack or towel, place it back in the freezer to prepare it for your next round of treatment.

, Make sure that the affected area is no longer numb. If so, wait until you regain feeling to reapply the compress. Continue alternating the treatment of 20 minutes on, two hours off, for three days or until swelling completely subsides., If you've been treating your injury with ice for three days and there is still swelling and no reduction in pain, you may have a fracture or dislocation that wasn't recognized. Visit the doctor to see if you have a more serious injury than you initially expected.

Learn about the different types of herb poultices.,
Choose the right variety of herb for your ailment.,
Try mint for congestion.,
Use dandelion and yellow dock for skin problems.,
Treat inflammation and discomfort with goldenseal or slippery elm.,
Try onion for ear or sinus pain.",How to Create a Poultice1," There are many different herbs that can be used in a poultice, but they are often divided into three categories. A poultice may be one of the following types:Astringent. Astringent poultices cause your skin to contract, which can be helpful if you need to remove splinters or fragments of foreign objects. Astringent poultices may also be helpful in to drawing out an infection. Astringent herbs include witch hazel, oak bark, yarrow, and flax. These herbs can be used fresh or dried. Activated charcoal, baking soda, and bentonite clay may be used as well.

Heating. A heating poultice is used to increase circulation to an area, thus increasing the warmth of the area. This type of poultice can relax muscles, relieve congestion in the lungs and sinuses, and help relieve sprains and strains. Mustard and onions are most commonly used in a heating poultice.

Vulnerary. In herbal medicine, a vulnerary is an herb that promotes wound healing. They are usually a bit gooey because they contain mucilaginous and oily material in order to soothe and protect the wound. Fresh herbs are best as vulneraries, but powdered or dried herbs can be used as well. The most commonly used vulnerary herbs are comfrey, marshmallow, flax, slippery elm, okra, and plantain.;
, Different herbs can be included in a poultice to address the symptoms you're attempting to treat. The medicinal properties of different herbs vary, so it's helpful to invest in a handbook or field guide about local flora so that you can get a better sense of what's available and how it can be used.Most herbal remedies are unverified and based mostly on historical anecdotes and folk stories. That doesn't mean that they don't work, only that they have not yet been medically confirmed and should be used in conjunction with traditional medicine.

, One of the most commonly grown and used herbs for use in poultices is mint, which is especially useful in treating congestion and other respiratory issues. Fresh mint makes an effective and pleasant-smelling poultice on the chest to help with upper-respiratory issues or congestion. Peppermint, wintergreen, and other common mints are all effective when used this way.


Herbs that have a similar effect and could be used to replace mint include lavender, lemon balm, calendula, and licorice root.

, Skin dryness or oiliness are commonly treated with a combination of these three herbs. Containing similar fatty acids and phytonutrients, these herbs can be somewhat effective at helping to clear up skin condition, along with regular washing with soap and warm water.Use a poultice of these fresh herbs as a home remedy for acne, eczema, psoriasis, and some mild rashes.

, General pain or rheumatic discomfort may be treated with a poultice of goldenseal and slippery elm. Other herbs used for similar afflictions include elderberry, fenugreek, flaxseed, slippery elm, and lobelia.


Slippery elm in particular is valuable in treating inflammation, displaying protective, emollient, expectorant, diuretic, and nutritive properties in healing. Slippery elm contains a significant amount of nutrition, comparable to oatmeal.In the American South, a poultice made from goldenseal combined with sage was once commonly used to treat breasts that were sore from lactation., While it may not provide the best-smelling poultice, onion is a commonly used treatment for ear or other sinus related pain, as well as foot odor. In either fresh or dried form, onion can make an effective poultice for its astringency and potency. In Ayurvedic medicine, onion poultices are also commonly used on the chest to address chest pains, congestion, and other breathing-related ailments."

Prepare your dried or fresh herbs.,
Wrap the herb mixture in a muslin or thin cotton cloth.,
Top the herbs with some plastic wrap.,
Wrap the poultice and tape it tightly.",How to Create a Poultice2," While fresh herbs are generally preferable for their abundance of nutrients, dried herbs also make effective and sometimes more easily available poultices. As long as you've got the right herbs, a good poultice can be made from fresh or dried herbs.Grind dry herbs with a mortar and pestle, then place the powder in a bowl. Cover with hot water to form a paste. Make sure that there is enough to cover the area. Don't over-saturate the herbs, just slowly add enough water to wet the herbs and mix them into a paste.
Chop at least a cup of fresh herbs and combine them with one cup of water on the stove. Boil for approximately one to two minutes to start breaking the plant matter down gently and form a more integrated mixture. Retain the liquid, which is full of nutrients.

, All-natural fabric needs to be used to wrap the herbs for a poultice, and the most common are muslin or thin cotton bandaging. The fabric needs to be non-irritating and breathable, so that the herbs can heal the affected area.


Lay out the cloth flat on a clean plate, or another clean surface. Cut strips of cloth large enough to cover the affected area you want to treat. Make sure that the cloth is wide enough to hold all of the herbs as well.
Pour the herb mixture into the center of the cloth, spreading them into a large enough layer to cover the affected area with the poultice. Leave the cloth flat on the surface and try not to wrap it up or cover it yet.

, To keep your mixture moist, you may want to top the herbal mixture with a layer of plastic wrap. The layer of plastic wrap will also help to keep the poultice contents from getting onto your hands while you hold it in place. The plastic wrap will form the ""back"" of the poultice, the part that faces away from the skin and the wound.


Cut out a small square of plastic wrap and drape it over the pile of herbs, tamping down the edges around the pile. Don't push down too hard, or you'll squeeze all of the liquid out of the mixture.

, After covering the herbs with the cling wrap, wrap up the cloth and tape it tightly to form a secure little package. Use some medical tape to secure the edges and keep it in a tight bundle, as flat and as secure as possible.


If there's any seepage, that's fine, but you don't want your poultice to be too leaky. It should feel similar to a teabag that's been squeezed out after being steeped.

Create a basic first aid poultice.,
Soothe insect and spider bites with an astringent poultice.,
Ease respiratory infections with an onion poultice.,
Get rid of warts with a garlic or onion poultice.,
Make an anti-inflammatory poultice.,
Provide relief for muscle aches, pains, strains and sprains with a mustard poultice.",How to Create a Poultice3," This poultice can be used for minor scrapes, cuts, bumps or bruises, similar to the way you might use a band aid or a cold pack. However, if the injury won’t stop bleeding or if a cut is longer than an inch (or deeper than ⅛-¼ inch), call a physician.Mix equal volumes of slippery elm (as a liquid) and Goldenseal (as a powder or dried herb) and combine it into a poultice. The slippery elm works as a vulnerary and goldenseal has both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Replace the poultice every 2 hours for the first 24 hours.

, You can use an astringent poultice to draw out any venom or toxins from the bites. Alternate an activated charcoal poultice with a baking soda poultice every four hours for the first 24 hours.For most insect and spider bites, you can make a compress with about 1-2 teaspoons of activated charcoal and baking soda.
After the first 24 hours, use a plantain poultice.
Insect and spider bites take about four to six days to heal and you can use a poultice for the first two to three days.

, Slice and dice one to two medium sized onions-- any type of onion will do. Heat the chopped onion on low heat in a small amount of water (1 to 2 tablespoons) until the onions are soft. Drain the excess water and place the onions into the poultice. Allow the onions to cool down so that they are at a comfortable temperature to have against your skin. Then, tie it off and place it on your chest. Replace the poultice every two hours.Though it is not usually done, in the case of respiratory infections, peppermint leaves can be added to the onions. The menthol in the mint leaves can help relieve congestion and diminish the onion scent.
You can use the onion poultice for two to three days. If there is no improvement or if the person develops a fever, or if they cannot eat, drink or sleep for a period lasting more than 12 hours, call your physician for advice.

, Peel and chop one to two cloves of garlic or 1/2 of a small onion. Place the garlic or onion in a poultice large enough to just cover the wart and not the surrounding skin. Leave it on for six to eight hours every day. After removing the poultice, rinse off the area with warm water. Alternatively, you can leave it on overnight and rinse it off in the morning., Inflammatory skin conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis as well as various rashes can respond well to poultices if the area of skin is relatively small. Herbs with anti-inflammatory properties that can be used in poultices include ginger, sage, thyme, turmeric, and slippery elm.If you use fresh ginger, peel and chop it into a few small pieces. Then, heat the pieces in a small amount of water before mashing and creating the poultice. Use the poultice every day for three to four hours, rinsing well with warm water after every use.
If you use slippery elm, you will not need to add water because slippery elm is usually sold as a thick liquid.
Use these poultices for as long as the skin is inflamed. You should see some improvement within one to two weeks. If not, try switching herbs. Always let your physician know that you are using poultices as well.

, Mix one tablespoon of mustard powder with 4 tablespoons of flour. Add one to two tablespoons of olive oil and make your paste. Make your poultice and wrap it or lay it on the injured area for no more than one hour at a time.If you are gluten-sensitive, make sure to use a gluten-free flour.
Keep in mind that mustard powder should always be diluted because otherwise it can cause rashes. Check the area to make sure there is no rash or reaction from the mixture. If there is a rash or reaction, remake the poultice using ½ tablespoon of mustard.

"
"
Secure the poultice over the area using a bandage.,
Use hot poultices for inflammation.,
Try warm poultices for soreness.,
Apply cold poultices for skin problems.,
Talk to your doctor about using poultices.",How to Create a Poultice4," Once you've secured your poultice into a nice package, lay it over the afflicted area, with the side with the cling wrap facing up and the other side contacting your skin. Depending on your affliction, it might be important to clean the area thoroughly first with soap and water.


If you're having congestion in your chest or your sinuses, the best place to put the poultice is on your chest, just under your chin.
If you're having skin problems, the best place to place the poultice is directly over the afflicted area. The same goes for inflammation and other internal issues. Secure the poultice as close as possible over the part that needs fixing.

, Different temperatures are traditionally used for different afflictions, to soothe, relieve, or heal, depending. If you've experienced some variety of inflammation, internal or external, it's most common to use hot compresses, as soon as possible after you've mixed up the hot herbs and created the poultice. Make sure it's comfortable to the touch, but as hot as possible.


A good way of remembering this is that hot inflammation needs to be treated with a hot poultice. Things like wisdom teeth flare-ups, inflamed tonsils, hemorrhoids, or other kinds of infection., If you're trying to treat sore joints or muscles with a poultice, it's a good idea to use a heating compress, which combines a room-temperature poultice with a heating layer of bandages.


After placing the poultice, wrap a small hand towel or blanket around the other side, then secure it with bandages to hold it in place. You can cool the area topically with the poultice, then heat the area deeply with warm layers.

, Anything that's irritated on the surface should be treated with cold compresses. After you make your herb mixture and wrap the poultice, toss it into the fridge for a few minutes to cool it down. Anything that's scraped or irritated needs to be treated with a cool compress and poultice., Poultices may be helpful for common conditions and minor aches and pains, but you should check with your doctor if your condition does not improve or if it gets worse. If you’re in serious pain or discomfort, seek medical attention as soon as possible.

Mix the water and rubbing alcohol.,
Add the mixture to a Ziploc bag.,
Remove any excess air.,
Refrigerate the bag for 12 hours.",How to Make an Ice Gel Pack1," You can make an ice pack using two parts water and one part alcohol. The alcohol will prevent the water from completely freezing. To start, mix your water and rubbing alcohol together in a mixing bowl.Two parts water to one part alcohol means for every two units of water, there should be one unit of alcohol. For example, if you're using two cups of water, use one cup of alcohol.
If you don't have rubbing alcohol, you can pick some up at a drug store.
Be sure to keep the rubbing alcohol mixture away from infants and small children. Rubbing alcohol can be dangerous when ingested and may irritate the eyes.;
, Choose a Ziploc bag that's the right size for the ice pack you want. Pour the water and alcohol mixture into the bag. Go slowly to avoid spilling any of the mixture.You may want to lay a towel down below where you're adding the water alcohol mixture to catch any that accidentally drips.
It's a good idea to double bag for added strength. This will not diminish the effectiveness of the ice pack.
Plastic bags should also be kept out of reach of children, and used as part of an ice pack only when supervised. Plastic bags pose a suffocation risk to unattended children.

, You want to make sure there is no air in the bag before you freeze it. Use your hands to press out any excess air before zipping the bag closed. If you have a vacuum sealer, use this to remove excess air from the bag., Place the bag in the refrigerator. In about 12 hours, it should be semi-frozen. You can now use the ice pack to ice anywhere you're sore."
"
Opt for a colorful dish soap.,
Fill a Ziploc bag with dish soap.,
Freeze the bag overnight.",How to Make an Ice Gel Pack2," Colorful dish soap is less likely to freeze all the way. It is also harder to mistake colorful dish soap for something edible in the freezer. If you want your gel pack to look like a traditional gel pack, you may want to opt for blue dish soap., You can fill the bag as full as you want it with dish soap. There is no set amount. Simply fill the bag until your ice pack is as big and bulky as you want it.Keep in mind more dish soap can cause a bag to take longer to freeze. If you need your ice pack very soon, opt to use less dish soap.

, Place your bag in the refrigerator. Allow it to freeze overnight. When you take the gel pack out of the fridge, it should be semi-frozen and ready to use on sore areas of your body."
"
Wrap an ice pack in a cloth before use.,
Ice your injury in short intervals.,
See a doctor under certain circumstances.",How to Make an Ice Gel Pack3," You should never place an ice pack directly on your skin. This can cause skin irritation due to the extreme cold. Always wrap your ice pack in something like a cloth or paper towel before applying it to your skin., Time how long you apply the ice pack. You should not leave an ice pack on for extremely long periods of time. In general, the ice pack should stay on for intervals for about 20 to 30 minutes.You should only apply an ice pack up to four times per day.

, Minor soreness and strain can be treated at home with ice and over-the-counter painkillers. However, under certain conditions, you should see a healthcare provider. See a doctor if you notice any of the following:Skin changes around the wound like blisters, a blueish color, or whitening of your skin.
Burning or numbness when icing your skin.

Place it on a radiator.,
Freeze the sock instead.,
Treat muscle pain and stress.,
Keep warm.,
Provide relief from aches, pains, and cramps.,
Get relief from a headache.,
Soothe with arthritis pain.",How to Make a Rice Sock," For a smaller heating pad, use a mid-calf sock. For a larger heating pad, use an over the calf or knee sock. Use a sock that’s 100 percent cotton. Choose a thick sock with a tight weave to protect your skin from the hot rice and to prevent the rice from seeping out.It’s important to use cotton, because it won’t burn or melt in the microwave.
Make sure the sock material doesn’t have metal threads in it, such as silver or copper, as these can ignite in the microwave.
Don’t use socks that have holes, as the rice will fall out.
For a larger homemade heating pad, use a small pillowcase instead of a sock.;
, Using a cup as a holder for the sock will make it easier to fill the sock with rice. Insert the sock into a tall glass. Wrap the cuff of the sock around the rim of the glass to open the sock, just like you do with a garbage bag around the rim of the can.








If the sock keeps slipping off the rim of the glass, use an elastic to keep the cuff in place.

, Don’t use instant rice or minute rice, as these are precooked and will be more prone to mold. You could need anywhere between 4 to 6 cups (780 g to 1.17 kg) of rice, depending on the size of the sock. Leave a quarter of the sock empty so you can tie a knot in the top. In place of rice, you can also use other dry grains, such as:









Beans
Barley
Flaxseed
Whole corn (not popping)

, Aromatics will help the rice smell nice when you heat it up. Simply our or sprinkle the aromatics in with the rice. Aromatics you can add include:









Five to 10 drops of essential oils
Herbal tea
Dried lavender flowers, Hold the sock cuff and carefully remove the sock from the glass. Twist the cuff closed to prevent the rice from falling out. Shake the rice around inside to spread it out evenly throughout the sock. Tie the top of the sock into a knot to keep the rice inside.








Tying a knot instead of sewing the sock together allows you to change the filling as it becomes old and stale-smelling.

, Over time, the rice inside the bag may begin to smell stale or burnt. When this happens, untie the sock, dump out the rice, and refill the sock with fresh rice. This will prevent fire hazards, and keep your rice sock from stinking up the house every time you use it.








, The fastest and easiest way to heat a rice sock is in the microwave. Place the rice sock in the microwave with a cup of water and heat it on high for one minute. Carefully remove the sock and feel it in multiple spots to test the heat level. Return the sock to the microwave for another 30 seconds if you still want it hotter.









Be very careful when you remove the sock from the microwave, as it will be extremely hot.
The water will add moisture to the air inside the microwave, and prevent the fabric or rice from getting scorched.Turn off the microwave immediately if you smell burning.Use an oven mitt or pot holder to remove the rice sock.

, Preheat the oven to 300 F (149 C). Place the rice in a deep baking dish or casserole dish. Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil. Fill an oven-proof dish or bowl with water. When the oven is at temperature, place the casserole dish on the top rack and the bowl of water on the rack below. Check the temperature of the rice sock after 20 minutes. Heat for another 10 minutes if necessary.









The water in the oven will help to keep the air moist and prevent the rice or the fabric from scorching.

, In wintertime, you can heat your rice sock on a radiator if your house has them. Wrap the rice sock in a sheet of aluminum foil. Place the sock on the radiator and let it heat up for 30 minutes to an hour. Turn the sock every 10 minutes to ensure even heating.








, Rice socks can also be frozen and used like an ice pack. Place the rice sock into the freezer and let it chill for about 45 minutes. Before using, shake the sock to shift the rice inside and ensure even cooling.







, Heated rice socks are ideal for soothing muscles that are sore or stiff from work, stress, or mild strain. Heat the rice sock to your desired temperature. Feel the bag to ensure there are no hot spots. Lay the sock directly on your sore muscle and leave it for 15 to 20 minutes., A hot rice sock is a great way to get warm when you’ve got a chill, are cold from being outside, or when your house just isn't cozy enough.For cold feet, heat the sock, lay the rice sock on the floor, and sit with your feet propped up on the sock. For overall chills, heat the sock, place it in your lap, and sit with a blanket around you.









You can also place a heated rice sock in your bed at night to stay warm as you fall asleep.

, When you're tired, sick, or sore, joint aches and pains are common. Place a heated rice sock on the affected area, such as around your neck, for 20 to 25 minutes to treat aches and pains. For menstrual cramps, lay down on your back and lay a heated rice sock on your abdomen for 30 minutes.

, Headaches, migraines, sinus pressure, and other ailments affecting the head and face can sometimes be treated with heating pads.Lay on your back and place a warm rice sock on your forehead or face for relief. Alternatively, you can also lay with your head on the rice sock, as though it were a pillow.

, Arthritis pain is often helped with heat, and a rice sock is a great way to apply this heat. Warm the rice sock and apply it to aching joints for 20 minutes at a time."

Don't forget posture!",How to Act Like a Princess," To be gracious means to be courteous, polite, and pleasant. Act accordingly. Treat everyone you meet with respect, just as a princess would treat everyone who surrounds her--her subjects included--with the utmost kindness and respect. You must accept everyone for who they are, and excuse their faults when they struggle to be the best they can be.A part of being gracious is to handle annoyances gracefully. If someone is rude to you, or something does not go your way, don’t throw a fit. Instead, act like a princess and try to make the best of the situation. If your plans have gone astray, try to find a way to enjoy the outcome. If someone is being annoying or rude to you, show kindness and patience to them. They may be quieted simply by your grace.
Never raise your voice or act cruelly to those around you--even if they are getting on your last nerve. Princesses stare adversity in the face and conquer it with kindness.;

, Really listen to what others have to say and reflect their interests in your conversation. Pay attention to what people say to you and show them that you empathize with them.


Part of being a princess is making speeches and listening to her subjects. While you may not be a princess, you can still show the same regard for what your friends, family, and acquaintances have to say. Never brush anyone aside or wave what they are saying off as trivial.

, Good princesses know that they have the power to influence others to do good. You do too! Simply having a positive attitude at all times will inspire those around you to make an effort to be positive. Use your positive attitude and confidence to make change happen. Take care of those who need help--the poor, hungry, and sick. Volunteer at soup kitchens and shelters--take care of those who cannot care for themselves.Make yourself a role model--find an issue that you are passionate about and make others aware of it.

, Essentially, be kind to everyone. Everybody is important to a princess and everybody is valued by a princess. Your friends are a treasure for life, so guard them well. They are more important than all the treasures in your jewelry box. And be sincere with everyone. It is easy to see when someone is being insincere. If you act naturally and kindly to everyone, you will simply glow and those around you will love you all the more for it.


You should also be kind to animals. Anyone who treats animals poorly should be considered a villain. Be loving to your furry friends and people will see you for the kind person you are.

, Princesses need to be confident in order to win the love of their subjects and help govern properly (after all, they could be queen someday.) Draw inspiration from these princesses and be confident in your own life. Look in the mirror and tell yourself you're beautiful and smart. You really are.

, Always make sure to have an open mind. Princesses must keep in mind what the people of her sovereignty need, and what will bring them happiness. You should also consider what the people in your life might need, no matter their situation. Has your best friend recently been dumped? Act like a princess and show her kindness and support--bring her ice cream, a great movie, and all the hugs in the world.Part of keeping an open mind is making sure not to judge anyone. We are all different and have different dreams and desires. Maybe your best friend wants to open a pet pedicure salon. Even if you might think it is a strange wish, keep an open mind and support your friend.

, Make sure to dress in clothing that suits you (and that you like) or else people will see that you are uncomfortable with yourself (and may question your confidence.) So dress the way you want to, but keep in mind that none of your clothes should be too revealing, rumpled, or have stains. Keep your clothes well pressed.


Pick a local designer and champion them. Shop ethically. People love princesses (and women) who support local designers.

, Stick with the basics and allow your inner beauty to shine through. Don’t put on gobs of makeup--keep it classy. Pick out a lipstick that you can wear in any situation and have it with you at all times (for reapplication.)


Don’t be afraid to try out fun new colors every once in a while. It is good to show that you have a fun side and can try new things.

, Daily hygiene is really important--always brush your teeth and hair before leaving the house. Shower regularly and invest in a delicious perfume that reflects your personality.


A part of being well groomed is maintaining your nails. Make sure that they are filed nicely and evenly. Paint your nails a light pink or pearly color (these colors are clean and pretty.) Consider getting a French Manicure ( or doing a frenchie yourself) as a french manicure will transform any hands into things of great elegance.

, While you do not have to do your hair up in tresses, ribbons, and ringlets like the princesses of yore, you should have a cute hairstyle that you maintain regularly (which means no split ends.) There are many ways to do classy updos for formal occasions. Try some out and see which works best for you.

, Princesses dedicate a part of their lives to helping those who cannot help themselves--you should do the same. Spend some of your time doing volunteer work. Every princess must have time to help the needy.Some ways to be charitable include making donations to charities, volunteering at shelters and hospitals, helping or hosting benefits, etc. Find a cause you are passionate about and try to better the lives of people around you or that need help.

, Make others want to dress like you and be like you. This could mean setting a fashion trend, or getting people interested in a certain topic (such as a cause, a completely new cookie recipe, etc.) Most importantly, show that you are confident in this trend, and promote it without being pushy.

, Everybody likes a well-hosted dinner party with a kind and gracious host. There is something incredibly classy about being able to pull off a really fabulous dinner. Create a great menu, select the right wines and cocktails, and decorate for the occasion (this means bringing out those silver candlesticks.)


Alternatively, you could host a tea. High tea is a wonderful tradition in the United Kingdom that involves tiny petite fours, scones, really delicious sandwiches, and a whole lot of tea.

, Just because you do not actually live in a palace does not mean that home should not be beautiful. Whether you live in a tiny studio apartment, or in a room at home, make it as beautiful as possible. Paint your walls a bright, cheery color. Decorate your house with a keen eye--pick a theme and fill your house accordingly.


A great way to bring happiness and beauty to a room is by adding a flower display. Buy a nice vase and fill it with beautiful flowers. Make sure to replace them when they begin to fade. If you don’t want to buy flowers all the time, you could invest in some house plants. Just don’t forget to water them!

, Bad posture gives you a bad reputation and at the end of the day your back will hurt a lot . Prevent all that with a straight back girl !"

, This means you take care of other people, even if you don't know them very well or at all. Try to raise some money for charity, if that's possible. If not, try volunteering.


A huge pro of Duchess Kate Middleton’s is her constant charitable work. No matter what cause, she is there giving her time and kindness to those who are less fortunate. Even if you aren't able to accomplish the above mentions points, no need to worry. If you do charitable work you will be seen as a princess regardless because your selfless need to help others is a royal treasure in itself.

, Kate has years of studying and good bringing up behind her. Try to enter some prestigious university, like Oxbridge. Ivy league is perfect too (Kate studied at St Andrews University in Scotland).

, Kate studied history of art, so you should try to be informed about upcoming artists, events or pieces of art.

, Kate maintains classic style, so you can follow it. Kate usually wears:


Nice dresses (she barely wears pants).
Heels
Cardigans
Purses
Jewellery (bracelets, earrings etc)
Hats (Kate's must have, in any colour and shape)
Coats (especially red, dark blue and black)

, She's naturally beautiful, so you shouldn't put much make-up. Nothing should be overdone. Smokey eyeliner is what you see at dance clubs, not at business meetings and bridal luncheons. An elegant, yet toned down essence is essential to your appearance.

, Elders, first time acquaintances, and those who are not direct family members or close friends should always be addressed in a formal manner. Once the other person gives permission, the use of a first name basis is acceptable.

, The rule is the right leg should have the left one tucked under so you look like you have one and a half legs. Straight and crossed legs are not permitted.

, Head up, shoulders back and glide. Eyes should be at eye level, not the ground! A drooping and hunched back demeanor gives off a lack of self-confidence and poise.

Don't be too high maintenance.",How to Be a Manic Pixie Dream Girl," Manic Pixie Dream Girls aren’t cynical. They’re the opposite of it! They are bubbly, high on life, and positive. At all times, they are positive!


A Manic Pixie Dream Girl ""lives freely and loves madly."" She is like a ray of sunshine into the otherwise drab world. Live every day to the fullest and always live in the moment. Be anything but ordinary.
The Manic Pixie Dream Girl doesn’t exhibit a strongly developed inner self beyond seeming happy and fun. However, this is what draws people to her. It feels good to be around her, and it’s always exciting.
Since the term was coined, people have found the Manic Pixie Dream Girl character in movies that date back into the 1930s. They include Zooey Deschanel in 500 Days of Summer (2009), Goldie Hawn in Cactus Flower (1969), Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby (1938), and Christina Ricci in Buffalo ’66 (1998).
More recent roles said to contain the archetype include Kate Hudson in Almost Famous, Charlize Theron in Sweet November, Natalie Portman in Garden State, and Anne Hathaway in Love & Other Drugs.;
, The Manic Pixie Dream Girl has been described as “adorably daffy.” She’s bubbly and a little goofy, but always in an endearing way. She’s the kind of person who might say something that sounds nonsensical because she thinks it’s funny. Manic Pixie Dream Girls are spontaneous, free spirited, and impulsive (sometimes to a fault).


To be adorably daffy, you shouldn't take yourself too seriously. Be able to make fun of yourself or light of the world. Smile a lot, and joke around. Manic Pixie Dream Girls are carefree. They aren’t brooding. They are free spirits. Talk a lot. Don’t be shy. The character has been described as “a fancifully if thinly conceived flibbertigibbet.”
Manic Pixie Dream Girls don’t hesitate to admit that they are complicated. However, they will talk endlessly about small details and probably leave out anything really big and dark in their pasts. They skip over things that are painful, and focus on seeing the good side of life.
Be friendly, kind, and a little bit flirtatious. Manic Pixie Dream Girls aren't typically rude. They're lovable and generally have magnetic personalities. Go up to other people first. Strike up a conversation.
Manic Pixie Dream Girls are described as dorky and klutzy, but in a cute way.

, Manic Pixie Dream Girls are usually very arty, creative types, which makes sense with their verbal abilities and their metaphorical minds. They are good at music, painting, writing, or art. If they aren't artists themselves, they like to listen to or watch other people be creative.


To be a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, embrace your creative side. Take an art class. Play music a lot. Write for a school newspaper.
The Manic Pixie Dream Girl is always saying profound things, like an artist would. She sees the intricacies in life, and she’s usually got something insightful to say. Try to say things that dig beneath the surface to help people understand their feelings and lives., It’s fairly common for a Manic Pixie Dream Girl to focus on a love interest who is less free-spirited than she is, especially a man who is brooding but soulfully deep inside.The Manic Pixie Dream Girl may act as his foil, trying to lighten him up, so that he learns how to love and live freely. He’s her alter ego. She is the bubbly personality who breaks him out of his cynical shell.
The archetype is controversial because some believe the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is given a shallow inner life and is too dependent in some films, but that doesn’t mean you have to embrace those parts of it.

, The Manic Pixie Dream Girl’s key role in many films and TV shows is to help a male love interest come out of his shell. This might sound sexist, but that’s probably why some have criticized the trope as such.


The author who coined the term, Nathan Rabin, once described the Manic Pixie Dream Girl as “an archetype... that taps into a particular male fantasy: of being saved from depression and ennui by a fantasy woman who sweeps in like a glittery breeze to save you from yourself, then disappears once her work is done.”That doesn’t mean you can’t embrace the Manic Pixie Dream Girl’s loving and caring nature. At her best, she deeply cares for those around her, and desires to help them achieve her own sense of happiness and outlook on the world.
In the best read, though, it’s OK to help others feel better about themselves, as long as you don’t forget yourself in the process. There’s nothing wrong with helping a depressed friend find a more positive way to look at life or to instill a sense of adventure in someone who could use it.

, The trope has been criticized by some who say that women should have independent goals, and the character is known for assisting a love interest. But you can borrow the character’s bubbly and endearing personality without sacrificing your own needs and wants.


It's OK to insert your own personality into the archetype. Over time, as others have played with the archetype on film, the Manic Pixie Dream Girl has become less defined by others in her life.
For example, in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kate Winslet's character acknowledges she fits the trope, but then rejects it, saying, “Too many guys think I’m a concept, or I complete them, or I’m gonna make them alive.” But, she says, she’s just looking for her “own peace of mind.”
You can maintain your own independent goals, and create a richer inner and outer life while still borrowing the character’s best attributes, such as her sunny spirit. For example, you can have career goals of your own, and sometimes go out with your friends, doing things separate from your love interest. Don't hesitate to share your needs and wishes.

, You’ll often see the character in something vintage but also a little girly. The Manic Pixie Dream Girl is usually feminine.The Manic Pixie Dream Girl is also sometimes a little punk. You might see her mix and match colors, from bright leggings to a star bag. You might find her mixing materials, from a leather jacket to a vintage dress.
Wear lacy dresses, and retro clothes. Choose dresses with interesting fabrics, lengths, and patterns. You don’t see Manic Pixie Dream Girls wearing a lot of boring solids.Toss a beanie on your head for good measure.
Try wearing pleated and full skirts, especially in fun patterns like polka dots or bright colors like lime green.Wear a blazer with patterned shirt. Be a hipster.

, The Manic Pixie Dream Girl usually wears her hair with bangs. Her hair is often short or shoulder length.


Shorter hair with bangs is the most common style worn by a Manic Pixie Dream Girl. Some Manic Pixie Dream Girls dye their hair a cool color, like blue or Kool-aid red.The Manic Pixie Dream Girl sometimes wears hair bows and other accessories in her hair. Remember, she is known for being particularly feminine.

, The Manic Pixie Dream Girl isn’t going to listen to mainstream pop. She’s too quirky and cool for that.


You’re most likely to catch her listening to underground, indie, alternative or obscure music. She doesn't follow trends or listen to what everyone else is listening. Stay away from mainstream pop.
For example, she might listen to the Unicorns, the Submarines, the Pixies, or the Shins. She’s probably into music, and might often quote it.
When it comes to movie interests, she continues this theme. She’s probably interested in independent and foreign films, especially French films. She is adventurous when dining out too, always willing to try new cuisines.

, You won't seem like a Manic Pixie Dream Girl if you're too high-maintenance and always fussing around with your style.


A Manic Pixie Dream Girl isn't likely to overdo the makeup or have beauty queen style pageant hair, with every strand of hair sprayed in place.
She's unlikely to be seen wearing the latest trend just because everyone else is doing it. You're not going to find her wearing high heels during the day. She's more likely to shop at vintage stores and thrift shops.
The Manic Pixie Dream Girl's style is not too perfectly coordinated. She's not worried about making sure her shoes match her nails and her nails match her shirt. She's a laid-back girl with a thrown-together vibe that somehow works. Her makeup is light and feminine - a dusting of pink blush on the cheeks, and a little white or neutral colored eye shadow.

Before you can set about becoming a fairy, you will first need to decide what type of fairy you wish to be. Try to match up your fairy personality with your existing one, as this will make the transition to fairy much easier. Search up different types and choose which one you think your most like. Maybe even take a quiz.


Will you be an earth fairy, who loves the trees, flowers, plants and woodland creatures? Who favors earthy-toned clothing and spends her time in the garden?
Will you be a water fairy, who loves all things water related and spends her time near rivers, lakes and streams, always with her feet in the water?
Will you be a fire fairy, who loves heat and flame, and is passionate about all of her chosen causes, no matter how large or small?
Will you be an air fairy, who craves open spaces and the wind through her hair? Who's breezy personality leads her wherever the wind takes her?
Will you be a dream fairy, who is in touch with her mystical side, and can wish good dreams on her friends and loved ones?
Will you be a musical fairy, who constantly finds melody and rhythm in the world around her -- whether it's the birds singing in the trees or the breeze tinkling through a wind chime?
Will you be a light fairy , who loves the sunshine and can glow as bright as a million stars?
Or will you be a dark fairy, a mysterious individual who prefers the night and dabbles in dark spells?;
, For example: Flameburst, Riverberry, Fluttersage, or Spiritwind. Fairy names generally reflect the personality or talents of the fairies they belong to. For example, earth fairies might be named Hazel or Buttercup, fire fairies could be Amber or Ashley, and water fairies could be Marina or Brooke.


Choose a fairy name which you feel best reflects your personality, or use a random fairy name generator on the internet to provide some inspiration.
Once you decide on a fairy name, you may wish to keep it to yourself, or share it only with those closest to you, as it is said that a fairy's name can be used to control her and make her use her magic unwillingly. Protect yourself by only revealing your fairy name to those you trust.

, Now what would a fairy be without her fairy dust? Your fairy dust, like your name, should reflect your personality and talents and should be completely unique to you. You can buy some glitter at the craft store to form the base of your fairy dust, but you’ll want to add some additional ingredients to it, to make it magical. You'll also want to make sure you always have it with you, so people see that it's needed and very special to you.


Make sure the glitter is fine and not coarse. Chunky glitter is a fairy no-no. Pick a color of your choosing, one that matches your fairy type. For example, green for earth fairies, blue for water fairies, black for dark fairies, purple for dream fairies, pink for music fairy, yellow for light fairy, white for air fairy and red/orange for fire fairies Add a drop of essential oil to the glitter to give it a subtle scent -- just don't add too much or it will start to clump.
Next you will need to add in some elements that match your fairy type. For earth, try dried flowers or leaves. For water, add some small sea shells or sand. For fire, add some flint, charcoal or wood. For air, add some cotton, or a small feather, for music a bell.
Shake your fairy dust well to combine the ingredients. Pour your fairy dust into a cute necklace container, which you can wear around your neck. Then you can access it whenever you need it. Alternatively, you can put it in a jar (which you can decorate) and keep it in your room or somewhere safe, for fairy trails, etc.

, A fairy signature is not the same as a human one though. A fairy signature is a physical item which best represents your personality or talents.


For instance, if your fairy talent is gardening, then your signature can be little dried pansy flowers. If you're a water-type fairy, you can use little pearls or seashells. If you're an air fairy, consider using a single feather. You get it? Something small to represent your talent, and you.
You can use your signature whenever you make something or complete an activity. For instance, if you plant some flowers in the garden, you could leave your fairy signature beside them. Or if you bake some cookies, you could use your fairy signature to show it was you who baked them.
For added effect, sprinkle some of your unique fairy dust over and around the signature.

, For a guide: Water fairies favor dresses that remind them of lakes and oceans lapping at their feet, fire fairies love tight clothing in their selected clothing, and wind fairies tend to love breezy, airy clothing. And Earth fairies love the feel of denim-like cloth, t-shirts, actual denim, and hardy clothing that is suitable for being outside all day while getting messy.


If you do decide to make your own fairy costume, find fairy-style patterns at a craft or big box store, and then buy the fabric. You can use a multitude of different fabrics -- velvet, tulle, sheer, iridescent, etc. You can also get used dresses and skirts at thrift shops which can be altered and decorated to your liking.
You should mostly wear flowy clothing items, so they remind people of the beautiful, flowing wings of a fairy.
To make a fairy skirt, you can simply take ribbon or an elastic band (the size of your waist or hips, depending on where you wear it), and then take pieces of tulle or mesh fabric (the length depends on how tall you are), and sew them to the ribbon or elastic. Make sure you give the skirt enough layers so it's not see-through.
To wear the skirt, you can simply tie the ribbon, but if you used elastic you’ll need a way to fasten the back, either with Velcro, or a snap button. To decorate the skirt, you could make large flower petals, stars or other shapes out of felt or fabric and attach them to the tulle.
For a fairy-style top, you can create one if you’re good at sewing, or find a renaissance style shirt (which can be dyed if need be), or a top that's airy and isn't too heavy.

, Fairies are famed for their fabulous flowing locks, so taking care of your hair is a priority. The color doesn't matter -- fairies are all about individuality! The most important thing is that your hair is in good condition, so make sure to keep it well hydrated with a good hair conditioner, drink plenty of water and maybe even apply a homemade hair mask from time to time.


In terms of styling, most fairies will let their hair grow long, letting it reach as far as their waist if possible. Never tie your hair up, always let it flow freely down your back. However, if you prefer to mix things up with a cute pixie cut, that works too!
Think about curling your hair, or even doing a few small ringlets just to frame your face. You can use a curling wand or a flat iron, use hair rollers or do pin curls to achieve this look. Alternatively, you can simply scrunch your hair for a more natural look.
Fairies shouldn't be too concerned with getting their hair perfect though -- they have more important things to think about! You'll often spot a fairy with bits of twigs or flowers stuck in her hair from all of her outdoor adventures!

, Fairies must have perfect, luminescent skin, so make sure to take care of yours well. Wash your face twice daily (no more, no less) and moisturize with a hydrating, brightening moisturizer. Zap any pimples or blemishes with an over-the-counter cream. Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables and try to drink between 6 to 8 glasses of water a day. Also, you might want to work on enchanting your magical powers. Meditating helps so does keeping in touch with your inner soul.

In terms of fairy make-up, use a light-reflecting foundation or powder which will add a healthy glow to your skin. Use a highlighter across your cheekbones and under your brow bone to add extra definition to your features. And if you really want to sparkle, a little facial glitter on your cheeks will do the trick!
Other make-up you could use to enhance your fairy features includes a light pink blush and lip gloss, a little mascara (applied only to the top lashes) and some eye shadow in a color which matches your fairy type and clothing.

, As mentioned before, fairies aren't overly concerned with their appearance, so you don't need to go overboard on the accessories. However, a few simple touches here and there can really bring your outfit together and make you feel like a true fairy.


Everyone knows that fairies can fly, on wings as delicate as a butterfly's. You can buy fairy wings at costume and Halloween stores , or make your own using wire and colored stockings. Find out how to make them here. Don't worry about having to wear your wings all the time though, often fairies will conceal their wings when they become ""big"", so going wing-free is not an issue.
If you want a fairy “crown”, that's simple! Take a headband and glue a fake butterfly, and/or some fake flowers to it. Or, take a few hairpins, or bobby pins, and glue fake flowers to them. Pin them throughout your hair for a pretty hairdo. Alternatively, you could make a crown from a daisy chain and just wear that, for a simple, earthy vibe.
Not all fairies carry wands, but some use them to channel their magic, particularly dream or dark fairies. Wands can either be bought, or made. You can make a wand using a twig from the garden or from any thin, straight piece of plastic. Attach ribbons or other decorations as you see fit. Use your imagination!
Most fairies are very old, as time works differently for magical beings. As a result, any jewelry they own will be very old. Shop in vintage or thrift stores for vintage jewelry, especially charm bracelets or necklaces with lockets. Anything with large gemstones will work too -- particularly if it's in a color that matches your fairy element. For example, dream fairies will favor moonstones, water fairies pearls, fire fairies rubies, earth fairies jade, etc.

, Part of being a fairy is having your own unique fairy scent. So depending on what type of fairy you are, you can create a perfume to match. You can just buy a suitable perfume, if you like, but it's better to make your own.


Think about buying a perfume kit, which contains different oils that you can mix and match to create a perfume as unique as you are. You can also buy natural essential oils, which come in most health food stores, and combine them with some water in spray bottle. Add a pinch of fine glitter to the scent for some subtle sparkle.
Some popular scents often found in fairy fragrances include floral scents, such as jasmine, lavender, chamomile, rose and geranium, fruity scents such as lemon, grapefruit and tangerine, spicy scents such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom and clove, and earthy scents such as vetiver, cedar and eucalyptus.
Again, pick a scent that corresponds with your fairy type. For earth, choose a flowery/grassy/fruity scent. For water, choose a rainy/beachy scent. For fire, choose a spicy scent. For air, choose a cotton/wind/mountain scent.

, Fairies are happy, sprightly creatures who always have a mischievous twinkle in their eyes. As a fairy, you should always have a smile on your face, whether it's a kindly grin, a naughty smirk or a dreamy half-smile.


You don't need to walk around beaming constantly, but always smile in your interactions with humans as it will help endear you to them, while also giving off a knowing, mysterious air.

, Fairies, though they love playing tricks and being mischievous, also have hearts of gold and will help out any creature in need. You can adopt such do-good behaviors in many aspects of your daily life, whether it's washing up a sink full of dirty dishes or spending time with the elderly in a nursing home.


Keep in mind that fairies often complete their good deeds anonymously, they don't do them for praise. Just knowing that they've made someone's day a little brighter is reward enough.

, No matter what type of fairy you are -- fire, water, dream or even dark -- all fairies are connected with the earth and with nature. As a result, they want to spend as much time outdoors as possible, feeling the grass beneath their toes and the wind in their hair.


As a fairy, you should feel a deep connection to nature and enjoy spending hours on end simply frolicking outdoors, appreciating the sights, sounds and smells of the earth. Try activities like picking bunches of wildflowers, climbing trees or practicing your bird calls.

, All fairies (though especially musical fairies) appreciate music, song and dance. They hear music everywhere, in birdsong, in the babbling of a stream, in the wind rushing through the trees and in the crackling of flames. They enjoy singing ancient chants and lullabies in their sweet, high voices and are fond of prancing around on their delicate feet to the beat of an invisible drum.


Fairies also enjoy playing such musical instruments as the flute and tin whistle, the harp, tambourines and bells and the bodhrán. Learning to play any of these instruments is a worthy pastime for any fairy.

, Tied in with their love of nature, fairies also feel a deep connection with the various fauna of woodlands and pastures. They can communicate with them, and connect with their emotions in a way humans never could. Birds, deer, rabbits, frogs, squirrels and mice are all friends of the fairy, so do your best to look out for these creatures whenever possible.


Leave a carrot or leaf of juicy lettuce outside for a passing rabbit or help a fallen bird to mend its broken wing. Anything you can do to show you care.
Fairies are not so fond of cats, however, who chase them and try to swat them when they're inhabiting their tiny, flying form. Of course, this is because cats are loyal to witches rather than fairies.

, Fairies live off nature, and enjoy all things natural. This is reflected in their food choices, as they prefer to eat fruits and berries, raw vegetables and nuts to most regular human food. Due to their connection with animals, they tend to stay away from meat, so adopting a vegetarian diet is common for fairies.


But although they stick to a strictly healthy, natural diet most of the time, fairies can't resist home baking and will devour homemade cookies, breads and cakes, especially if they contain flavors of vanilla, nutmeg or cinnamon, mmmm!

, Create a fairy-friendly environment in your room by decorating in colors that match your fairy type. Hang dream-catchers and wind chimes from the ceiling and place small, fairy statues on your desk, bedside table and windowsill. Hang a gauzy canopy around your bed, to protect you while you sleep. Keep a stash of fairy dust somewhere safe, like on a high shelf or in a locked drawer.

, Certain herbs, plants and flowers are particularly favored by fairies, so planting them in your backyard can turn your garden into a fairy haven.


Fairies are particularly fond of edible plants such as rosemary, peppermint and licorice root, fragrant shrubs like lavender and eucalyptus, and brightly colored flowers that attract butterflies and hummingbirds, such as honeysuckle, calendula, snapdragon, petunia, sunflower and foxglove.

, It goes without saying that fairies enjoy the company of other fairies, so once you have adapted to the fairy way of life you can send out an open invitation for others to come and visit!


You can attract their attention by planting the above-mentioned flowers in your garden, by baking homemade bread or cookies and allowing the wonderful smells to waft through the air, by blowing bubbles into the sky (fairies love bubbles), or by building little fairy homes around your garden where they can stay.
But most of all, you just need to behave like a true fairy in your day to day life -- being good to others, connecting with nature and opening your heart. If you can do that, other fairies will sense a kindred spirit, and you won't need to try too hard to get their attention.

If you want to go to extremes, try using fake tattoos to add slashes to your body to look like there is lava pouring out of your body.,

Brown, gold, silver, black or purple chokers, brown, white, gold or silver wrist wraps, or flowy pieces of fabric are great for accessories and cover ups.

,
If you can, get a black cat or black bird.",How to Be a Fire Princess," Fire means sensuality. You can achieve this look by using thick eyeliner that gives it a cat like look. If your eyes are sensitive, then just apply thick eyeliner on your bottom and top lash lines for look that is still intense, but won't hurt your eyes. You can also wing it on the top and bottom, or do a cat eye. The best look for daytime would just be lining your top and bottom lash lines. Try black, dark red, or bright red to achieve seductive and fiery eyes.;
,, Try red, black, or white tattoos. Only do this for parties or for a special night out. You can make red fire symbols down your arm, symbols of fire on your stomach, ancient words meaning or god of fire's name on your chest, black fire symbols on your arm, or use a ton of black eye makeup.

, You can also leave it down and make it slightly wavy so it looks like lava. If you want to grow mega dread-locks, okay! Some fire princesses liked long and stick straight. It's a very seductive look. You can also do buns. Very curly/natural is never a wrong way to go. Short straight bob with bangs can be good too. If you want to go a little longer with your bangs, then that's okay too. High straight ponytails never look bad. Or wavy and voluminous hair. If you want to try pigtails, make sure they are really high and straight. Also, leave some face skimming pieces up front. Last but not least, if you have really long hair, straighten it and put it into two braids.

, Dark blues, dark browns, light browns. But if you want, you can leave your hair blonde or it's natural color. If you want to go extreme, then dye your hair purple or pink. Many people don't think that pink or purple are fire colors, but they certainly are. Even more extreme is the kind of hair that starts at the roots as one color and fades to another at the tips. To do this, you can try one color that is designed to fade to another color. When in doubt, a professional salon can help with that design, or just stick to your natural hair color.

, Good colors for shirts include brown, pink, red, white, grey, orange, black, gold, or silver. Cropped and torn shirts, plain strapless shirts, pin up style strapless tops, bustiers or corsets, vests, cropped military fabrics, torn track jackets, turtleneck long sleeved sweaters, or very thin drapery are great on top.

, Good colors for bottoms include brown, red, yellow, black, purple and white. If you want to wear a short skirt, make sure it's bouncy. For mid length skirts, make sure it's slit up to your thigh. If it's long, make sure it flares out or ruffles. Your best bet as a fire princess is skirts. Make your brighter colors on top.

,, Any kind will do. Sprinkle red, yellow, or graffiti all over the floor. This will make it look like there is little balls of fire or lava on the floor. If you can, cover all the walls with black construction paper. Decorate this with fluorescent paints. When you want your fire effect, turn off the lights and use a black light to make everything glow.

Figure out what life was like back then compared to modern life: what people ate, how people dressed etc. Choose a medieval princess from history that you like as inspiration. Alternatively, you could base your style on a Fairytale Princess for a much less historically accurate but equally adorable approach.;
, Look for some with flowing sleeves on the end. Search for a medieval dress at the store first and if you can't find one, purchase it online. if you can't find these types of dresses online or at the store, just wear any plain dress with a medieval design. If you want to wear a skirt, try wearing a tank top with it. Wear the colours of your country. For example, if you live in France, wear blue, white, and red.

, Shoes such as Yeezys and Nike didn't exist back then. Instead, wear a pair of brown or black old fashioned shoes which can easily be found from a local costume or shoe store.

, Download some catchy classical music onto your cellular device. You could also buy some CDs. Replace modern music with old songs instead. Play classical music when you're getting ready in the morning to feel just like a real princess.

, Say things such as ""beautiful"", ""swimmingly"", ""elegant"",""dashing"" ""beauty"", and ""Ails"" (such as ""Father looks troubled. What ails him mother?"").

, Using slang words such as slay and basic isn't very medieval at all. Cut out slang from your vocabulary little by little to make it easier on yourself.

, Even though in Medieval times, they talked in Old English, they also spoke a little Latin. Purchase a book or Latin dictionary to widen your vocabulary. Look for Latin speakers or local lessons. Be sure to practice every day. It may be tricky, but it's worth a try!

, For a princess, you may have a prince. Have a prince who is always charming, doesn't swear, and loves medieval times. This, of course, is optional. It's not mandatory to have a prince.

, Try going to an etiquette class. This will make you more classy. Also, if you're at home, you don't have to have etiquette if you don't want to. Just outside your doors, you must have manners, nobody likes a slob.

, In medieval times, people's religion was normally Christianity. But, if you have a different religion, then keep it, you don't have to change it. Being atheist is fine too, don't force yourself into a religion if you don't want to.

, If you can, find a friend who can dress you or redress you. Obviously don't force them. Have someone cook your meals and serve you like your mother or father.

, Do what makes you feel happy! Kill them with kindness, being rude back will just add fuel to the fire.

, Pretend that your parents are king and queen of the kingdom, treat the with dignity and respect. Listen to your parents when they tell you to do something. Don't talk back. You shouldn't just respect your parents, respect everyone, especially your elders.

, When you're a princess, there's never a dull moment. Spend your time doings things you love, and surround yourself with people who love you for you.

, Romance is key in a relationship. Dance with your prince to some classical tunes and invite his family over for dinner. Do a romantic activity together that you both enjoy such as treating yourself to dinner at a fancy restaurant. If he wants you to do something that you don't want to do, he isn't your true prince.

, A prince`s job is to defend a princess; while there will be no evil witches trapping you in a cage only for you to be romantically rescued by your prince, there are other things for your prince to protect you from: for example, make sure that he knows he can protect you from insects: give him a kiss on the cheek every time he comes to your rescue."

",How to Act Like a Princess in School (Middle High)," Princesses always have good hygiene, so that means brushing your teeth, washing your hair and all your personal cleanliness. The fundamentals of personal hygiene should do the trick. Taking care of yourself should not be too much of a task, so keep it simple.;
, Don't: bite your nails, smoke, take drugs, pick your nose, scratch your butt. Start slowly but surely, since you can't stop a bad habit overnight.

, This is the most important part of being a princess. With all of the events you'll get invited to, you will be scrutinized. One false move could give you a bad reputation. Make sure to say 'please' when you want something and 'thank you' if you get it. Say 'excuse me' when you want someone to move. Say 'excuse my reach' when reaching in front of someone. Learn how to curtsy. Table manners are also important, so having some is very important.

, The princesses of today are not as reserved as they were a century ago, yet they are still modest enough for our time. Take a cue from the Duchess of Cambridge and go for dresses (an appropriate cut so you won't show too much skin) that fit well, simple blouses (no graphic tees, because that isn't too professional), jeans (Yes!) on casual days and almost never on your royal duties (Please note that there are some exceptions to that rule), skirts that go down and cover at least your thighs, and clean shoes such as flats. Simple, professional and elegance are key words when looking for princess-like clothing.

, Mascara, lipstick, blush, and eye shadow is really all you need to get a natural look. Natural hues are all you need.

, Be kind to every animal you encounter. Stroke a cat, give a bone to a dog. Race a bunny, give cheese to a mouse. Be friends with everyone. Do not envy or be jealous.

, This is one of the hardest steps, but being a princess means you have lots of responsibility. Make your bed in the morning and set the table for dinner. A true princess helps out.

,, Snow White worked hard, did her chores, and contributed to her home, both with the dwarves and while living at the castle. Being responsible like this is especially important for princesses! You should do the same and help out where you can, doing your chores, getting a job, and generally being more responsible.

, She went everywhere just to find her sister and make him/her feel better. If you make one of your friends mad or sad, try to cheer them up, but know when it's enough.

, Cinderella was kind to everyone, from cruel sisters to tiny mice. This kindness was what made her inner beauty and brought about her happy ending. Be kind like Cinderella, even when you don’t have to. People will be mean to you or may not have much to offer you, but like Cinderella shows, that doesn’t mean you have to be horrible right back.

, Princess Aurora, also called Sleeping Beauty or Briar Rose, was kind and friendly with all the animals in the forest where she lived. She lived harmoniously with the environment around her and you should do the same. Respect nature, and do your part to protect the environment.

, Life can be hard sometimes and we can often get really caught up in school or other responsibilities, but Ariel shows us that it’s just as important to find joy in life. Ariel collected things and saw the beauty in things that no one else could see. Like Ariel, you should enjoy the world around you and find happiness in the things you do.

, Belle had it rough with the Beast, but she also saw someone who had real opportunity to be a better person. She helped him to heal his own pain and find happiness in life. Like Belle, you should help people be better. When you see someone that’s having a hard time, try to help them instead of just writing them off as a bad person. This graciousness is a truly princess-like quality!

, Jasmine didn’t listen to what was normal for her society, she saw problems and she fought against them to improve her own life. Follow your own heart, like Jasmine, and do what you know to be right. This can be hard sometimes, even mean going against what’s normal, but you’ll be a happier, stronger person, just like Jasmine.

, Pocahontas had good reason to be scared of the English settlers, just like the rest of her people, but instead of judging them for being different, she worked to understand them and find middle ground. She saw that we are all the same people, the people of the world, and she worked to bring peace and prosperity for everyone. Search for understanding and peace, like Pocahontas, smoothing out arguments and problems between the people in your life so that everyone is treated fairly.

, Lots of things that we have to do in life will be pretty scary. Mulan was certainly pretty scared when she had to go off to war to protect her family and her country. But bravery, or doing what you have to do even though you’re scared, is a quality that you’ll need if you’re going to face the challenges in your life. Be brave, like Mulan, and take your problems head on.

, Tiana learned from her father that you can have almost anything your heart can dream up but you have to work hard to get it. Tiana did just that and got everything she needed! Work hard like Tiana to make your own dreams come true. Study in school and get where you want to be by working the right jobs and getting a good education, rather than depending on someone to come to your rescue.

, When Rapunzel and Flynn got into trouble in the bar, instead of being afraid of the scary men there, she treated them all like normal people and became their friend. Like Rapunzel, don’t judge people. You shouldn’t judge a book by its cover and people will always surprise you.

, Merida had to save her mother after making a pretty serious mistake, which was hard and scary but very much the right thing to do. Like Merida, you should do the right thing, especially when it’s hard. This is one of the defining qualities of a princess and almost every princess on this list has had to do this exact same thing. It may not always be easy, but you can follow your heart do the right thing, and find your happiness.

, She is loyal, strong, brave, caring, and beautiful. She never gives up. She follows order. She met WALL-E and she doesn't want any harm to him and she's being kind to WALL-E. The right thing to do to be like her is to be brave, strong, kind, never give up, and follow orders.Smile. Be friendly and outgoing. Or if you are shy, flash that beautiful smile of yours to everyone you see.

, Princesses don't get upset over the little things. Don't let your little sibling ruin your day, even though he purposely spilled milk on your favourite skirt! It isn't the end of the world.

"
Drink some water when you first get up in the morning.,
Carry water on you at all times.,
Drink water before you get thirsty.,
Monitor your urine as a sign of your hydration status.In addition to drinking before you get thirsty, you should also check your urine as an indication of whether you are staying hydrated enough.,
Limit caffeinated and sugary drinks.",How to Stay Hydrated1," Some people only drink milk or coffee in the morning, but adding at least one glass of water will help to increase your hydration in the morning. You can keep a water bottle beside your bed if that makes it easier to remember to drink it.;
, Water bottles are cheap to buy and can be carried to work, to school, or whenever you are away from the house for several hours. Some have marks for reading how many milliliters or fluid ounces of liquid you have, so that you can keep track of how much you have been drinking.


A common recommendation is to drink at least 8 eight ounce glasses of fluid daily, and more if you are exercising or out in the hot weather. However, men need an average of 13 eight ounce glasses of fluid and women need an average of 9 eight ounce glasses of fluid every day.Or, you can also divide your body weight in half and drink that amount of water in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, then you would need to drink 80 ounces of water per day.

, When you are thirsty, your body signals that it already has a lack of fluid. To stay hydrated, you should drink water often enough to keep this from happening. As you age, your thirst receptors will become less effective at sensing your body's need for hydration, so it is a good idea to get into the habit of sipping water throughout the day.

, People who are consuming adequate fluids will have plenty of clear, light yellow urine. On the other hand, those who are dehydrated will have less urine that is a darker yellow as it is more concentrated.

, Caffeine makes your body lose its fluids more rapidly, and sugar in drinks, even orange juice, is not ideal for hydration purposes. Instead, aim to drink more water. Even though water may be less tasty or appealing at the outset, it is better for your body's overall health.

"
"
Be aware of factors that will affect how much water you need.An important step to staying well-hydrated is to know what your water intake needs are.,
Drink more when you exercise.,
Recognize the impact of illnesses on your hydration status.,
Keep in mind that children can become dehydrated quickly.,
Consume more fluids when you are pregnant or breastfeeding.The recommended water intake for pregnant women is 10 cups per day (as opposed to the usual 8 cups per day for non-pregnant women).",How to Stay Hydrated2," Keep in mind that the basic recommendation of 8 eight ounce glasses of water per day is flexible. You will need to drink more on top of this depending upon the following factors:


How much you exercise
Your environment (hotter temperatures, or even humidified air indoors, require greater water consumption)
Your altitude (higher altitudes are more dehydrating)
Pregnancy and breast-feeding, both of which increase your water needs.

, For an average workout, you will need 1.5 to 2.5 cups of additional water (on top of the 8 eight ounce glasses of water per day that are already recommended). You may need even more than this if the duration of your workout is over an hour, or if it is a workout of particularly high intensity.Note that, for workouts that are very intense or longer than one hour in length, an electrolyte sports beverage is preferable to water to maintain your hydration.
This is because intense exercise causes you to lose a lot of salt through sweat. Without adequate salt, regardless of how much water you drink you will be unable to effectively absorb it through your digestive tract.
Therefore, to compensate for lost salt, the electrolytes in the sports drink (such as Gatorade or Powerade) are key, and will help you to absorb the water you are drinking more efficiently.

, It is important to know that illnesses - particularly ones that involve diarrhea and/or vomiting - require exceptional efforts to stay hydrated. If you only vomit once or a couple of times, such as during a food poisoning attack, it is less worrisome than an ongoing illness of three to five days with consistent diarrhea and/or vomiting (such as the Norwalk virus or other gastrointestinal illnesses).If you have a gastrointestinal flu, you will need to make a big effort to stay hydrated at this time. Your best bet is an electrolyte sports drink rather than pure water because, similar to intense endurance exercise, you will be losing a lot of salt through diarrhea and/or vomiting. Take small sips frequently throughout the day.
If you cannot keep the fluids down or if you are continuing to have diarrhea and vomiting despite efforts to hydrate yourself, then you will need to go to a clinic or urgent care setting for intravenous hydration.
In order to adequately hydrate yourself when there is salt loss involved, you will need to replace not only the water, but also the electrolytes (hence why Gatorade, Powerade, or another sports drink is your ideal option).
If you have an illness of this nature, sip on fluids consistently throughout the day and consume as much as you are able to. It is better to sip slowly and often than to drink a lot at once, as consuming too much at one time may trigger further nausea and/or vomiting.
Note that, in very severe illnesses, you may require IV fluids in a hospital setting to maintain hydration. See your doctor if you are concerned as it is better to be safe than sorry.
Other medical and health conditions may also affect your hydration status, though seldom as severely as a gastrointestinal flu. Speak to your doctor if you would like further information as to how your health conditions (such as kidney disease or other chronic diseases) may have an impact on your water consumption and hydration status.

, If your child is sick, he or she may become dehydrated much faster than an adult and may need to be seen by a physician sooner than an adult would. If your child becomes listless and hard to wake, then emergency medical attention is necessary. If your child has no tears when crying, take her in for an evaluation. Other symptoms of dehydration in children include:not urinating or urinating less than is usual (an infant might have dry diapers for three hours or more)
dry skin
feeling dizzy or lightheaded
constipation
sunken eyes and/or sunken fontanels
rapid breathing and/or rapid heart rate

, For nursing women, the recommended water intake is 13 cups per day. In both of these cases, you will need additional fluids to support your growing baby, and/or to aid in milk production which uses a significant amount of water.

Shivering (although as hypothermia grows more severe, shivering will stop)Exhaustion
Pale skin
Hyperventilation (quick breathing) or hyperventilation (slow, drawn-out breathing)
Confusion
Slurred speech
Weak or no pulse
Dilated pupils
Unconsciousness;
, It needs to be large enough to wrap around the patient. Also keep in mind that the tarp will be wrapping around several layers of insulation.Try to find a waterproof blanket, such as an emergency blanket. If this is not possible, you can use other thick blankets or sheets. This will provide an insulating layer between the ground and the rest of the wrap.

, If you have a foam mat, you should place that first on the tarp, stacking other layers on top. If you don’t have foam mats, you can use blankets or a sleeping bag to form thick insulating layers. The more blankets and bags you add, the more insulated the patient will be., Remove any wet clothing, and if possible, replace these with dry clothing.If you don’t have any dry clothes, you can wrap the patient in a dry blanket or towel instead., If you have a sleeping bag on top, unzip it and help the patient lie down inside. If you have a blanket or a foam mat as your top layer, rest the patient above it. Before you wrap the patient, you will want to properly apply heat.

, Good compresses include chemical hot packs and hot water bottles.Make sure they are insulated in a towel or blanket so that direct heat is not placed against the patient’s body. Compresses should be warm but not hot. The goal is to warm the patient slowly.Avoid placing the patient in a bath of hot or warm water.
Do not use an electric source of heating such as a heat lamp or heating pad., You want to stabilize the core temperature of the patient’s body. Put the insulated compresses against their armpits, neck, head, groin, and torso., While the hands and feet of the patient will be very cold, if you warm these suddenly, you may cause shock in the patient, lowering their blood pressure and potentially risking dangerous complications. Warm only the core of the patient before you wrap them.You will also want to avoid massaging or rubbing the limbs of the patient. This will not help warm them, and it can send them into shock., If you do have a source of warmth, you can use your own body heat to rewarm the patient.Make sure you are dry, and undress down to your underwear to maximize skin to skin contact. Lie down next to the patient, and press your body against them. Cover both of your bodies in blankets. Skin to skin contact should be used only when other options are unavailable.Continue skin to skin contact until medical help has arrived., You can use a hat, scarf, or even an extra blanket. Once you have covered their head, take any extra fabric and tuck it around their ears and skull to insulate them. If the patient is wrapped correctly, only the person's face should be exposed., Grip the outermost layer, and pull it tightly over the patient like a burrito. Tuck in any extra material around the person’s body to keep the wrap closed. Make sure that they can breathe.

, Keep the patient lying down during the entire process. This will help their heart pumping blood, and it can prevent shock. This is particularly important if the patient was rescued from open water., Ask the patient to cough. If they are able to cough, they will be able to swallow.Dilute sugar into some warm (not hot) water to give the patient energy. Do not try to feed them solid food., Call 911 immediately. Hypo-wraps can stabilize a patient until help arrives, but they cannot heal hypothermia. Medical care is needed to properly treat the patient while ensuring that they do not go into shock. If you are outdoors or in the wilderness, be extremely specific about your location since it can be difficult for emergency responders to track you."
"
Stay out of direct sunlight.,
Avoid going out at the hottest part of the day.,
Get acclimated.,
Avoid enclosed spaces.",How to Avoid Sunstroke1," The direct cause of sunstroke is exposure to extreme heat and sunlight.The first step to preventing sunstroke is to stay out of direct sunlight. This is especially true on hot days. Make sure you keep your bare skin away from direct sunlight as much as possible. If you have to be out in the sun, wear a hat or walk with a light umbrella.


Trips to the beach and other outdoor locations are common in the summer. In these situations, try to give yourself a break from the sun as much as you can. Sit down under a beach umbrella or take a walk into a nearby store with air conditioning to ease some of the stress from the heat on your body.;
, The most dangerous time of day is the time midday to the afternoon when it is the hottest. Try to go out in the early or later parts of the day if you want to enjoy the outdoors or have to work outside. Also avoid exercising outside during this time of day as well. Exercise causes your body temperature to rise, which will make the likelihood of sunstroke even worse, especially if you are in the direct sun.The sun is strongest between the hours of 9 am to 4 pm.If you can, go out in the early morning or later in the afternoon, when the sun's rays are not as intense.

, If you want to spend a lot of time outside in the heat, or if you have to work outside in the heat, get yourself acclimated to the weather first. Start out with small shifts in the heat, building up your resistance to the elevated temperature that you are not used to. As you get used to it, you can start spending more and more time outside, but always remember to take breaks from the heat to give your body a break.


It can take several weeks for your body to fully adjust to hot weather, so be patient and take it slow.You can also acclimate yourself a little at a time as well. Turn off the air conditioner in your house when you know you are going outside later in the day. This will slowly raise your body temperature and help you get accustomed to the heat before you even step outside.

, Another way to get sunstroke is being in an enclosed space with no air flow. This can be a house without air conditioning or fans, a car without the windows open, or any other small, enclosed room that has no cool air movement. If you live in an area without air conditioning, buy fans to help circulate air. This will help cool down the temperature and lower your body temperature. You should also open the windows in the room, which will help you circulate more air as well.


Never leave yourself, a child, a loved one, or an animal in a locked car, even if you have the windows down. This can cause major problems because the air in the car will heat up to extremely hot temperatures on a warm day. The temperature in a car can go up by 20 °F (−6.7 °C) in just 10 minutes.Many cities also have public cooling spaces during heat waves -- check online to see if there is one near you.
If you don't have or can't afford air conditioning, try to spend time in public spaces that have it, such as shopping malls, movie theatres, museums, etc."

The person may also have slurred speech and be unable to do basic tasks like pick up objects or move around the room.

, These include:Confusion or drowsiness.
Tiredness and low energy.
Cold or pale skin.
Hyperventilation, and slow or shallow breathing.
A person with moderate hypothermia will usually stop shivering completely and may have slurred speech or poor judgement. He may try to shed his clothing even though he is cold. These are signs his condition is deteriorating and require immediate medical attention.

, Even if the person is suffering from mild hypothermia, you should seek medical care for her right away. Mild hypothermia can turn into a more severe condition if it is not treated.Bring the person to the hospital if she is unconscious and has a weak pulse. These are all signs of severe hypothermia. Someone with severe hypothermia may appear to be dead, but it’s important to call emergency services right away to determine if she is in a state of hypothermia and can still be treated. This is a life-threatening situation.
Medical treatment can still be used to resuscitate people with severe hypothermia, though it is not always successful.

, Babies with hypothermia may look healthy, but their skin will feel cold, they may be unusually quiet, or refuse to feed.If you suspect your baby has hypothermia, call 911 to ensure he gets medical care right away.

, No matter what type of hypothermia the person is experiencing, its important to call 911 for immediate medical care. The first half hour after the person’s symptoms become clear are the most critical phase of hypothermia management. You can treat the person while you wait for the ambulance or medical professionals to arrive., Place her in a room-temperature spot indoors. If going indoors isn’t possible, protect the person from the wind with other clothing, especially around her neck and head.Use towels, blankets, or other clothing to protect the person from the cold ground.
Don’t let the person help in her own treatment, as this will only expend more of her energy and worsen her condition., Replace her wet clothing with warm, dry clothing or blankets., Avoid rewarming the person too quickly with a heating lamp or a hot bath. Instead, apply warm, dry compresses to the center of her body, on his neck, chest, and groin area.If you use hot water bottles or a hot pack, wrap them in a towel before applying them to these areas.
Do not attempt to warm his arms, hands, and legs. Heating or massaging these limbs can cause stress on his heart and lungs, and could lead to other serious health issues.Do not try to warm up the person by rubbing his body with your hands. This will only irritate his skin and cause shock to his body., Ask her if she can swallow before you offer her any liquids or food. Herbal tea that is caffeine-free or hot water with lemon and honey are good options. Sugar in the beverage can help to boost her energy. You can also offer her high energy foods like chocolate.Avoid giving the person alcohol as it will slow down the rewarming process. Don’t give her cigarettes or tobacco products. These products can interfere with her circulation and slow down the rewarming process., Once the person’s body temperature has increased and some of his symptoms have lessened, keep him wrapped in dry, warm blankets or towels until medical help arrives., If the person is not breathing, coughing, or moving around and her pulse has slowed down, you may need to perform CPR. To perform CPR correctly:Locate the center of the person’s chest. Identify the space between her ribs, a bone called the sternum.
Place the heel of one hand over the center of her chest. Put your other hand over the first and interlace your fingers. Keep your elbows straight and align your shoulders over your hands.
Begin compressions. Push down on the center of her chest as hard as possible. Pump at least 30 times, hard and fast. Do this to rate of at least 100/minutes. You can pump to the beat of the disco hit “Stayin’ Alive” to maintain a steady rhythm.Allow the person’s chest to rise fully after every pump.
Tilt the person’s head back and lift her chin. Pinch her nose and cover her mouth with yours. Blow until you see her chest rise. Give two breaths. Each breath should take one second.
CPR is to be continued for a prolonged period. There have been reports of younger patients with severe hypothermia surviving an hour of CPR. If there is another person present, try switching off performing CPR so you don't become exhausted.

, Once the ambulance arrives, the emergency medical technician, or EMT, will assess the person’s condition.A person with mild to moderate hypothermia and no other injuries or issues will likely not need to be taken to the hospital. The EMT may recommend more home treatment, with gradual rewarming of the person. But a person with more severe hypothermia will need to be observed in the hospital.

, If you have called for an ambulance and the person is unconscious or unresponsive, the emergency medical technician will likely perform CPR., Once the person arrives as the hospital, speak to the doctor about possible treatment options, especially if the hypothermia is severe.


Cardiopulmonary bypass is when blood is withdrawn from the body, warmed up, and then returned to the body. This is also known as extra corporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO).This technique is only available at major hospitals that have specialist emergency services or units that regularly perform heart surgery.
A person with severe hypothermia often stands a better chance of surviving if she is taken directly to one of these hospitals, even if it means bypassing a smaller hospital along the way. Alternatives to cardiopulmonary bypass include warmed iv fluids, chest tubes with warm irrigation, and/or warmed hemodialysis.

Elevate the injury.",How to Ice an Injury," There are a multitude of injuries that call for a cold compress. Most of these are minor bumps and bruises that don't require further medical attention. Some, like fractures, dislocations, and concussions, require emergency medical treatment. If you are at all unsure, visit the doctor or emergency room to receive the correct diagnosis and treatment.;
, A fracture is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. You can apply a cold compress to a broken bone to reduce swelling and pain. This should only be while you're waiting for help from a medical professional, and not in place of medical treatment. If you have any of the following symptoms, either call 911 or get to the emergency room.A deformed or misshaped body part. For example, a visible bend in the forearm would indicate a broken arm.
Severe pain that gets worse when the body part is moved or pressure is applied.
Loss of function in the injured area. Often the area below a broken bone will lose some or all motion. Someone with a broken leg may find it difficult to move his foot.
Bone protruding from the skin. Some serious fractures push the broken bone through the skin.

, A dislocation is when one or both of the bones that form a joint are forced from their normal positions. This also requires medical attention. You can apply a cold compress while waiting for medical help, just like with a broken bone. If you exhibit the following symptoms, keep the area immobile, apply a cold compress, and seek medical help.A visibly deformed or out of place joint.
Bruising or swelling around a joint.
Severe pain.
Immobility. It is often difficult or impossible to move areas below the dislocated joint.

, While ice packs are often applied for bumps and bruises on the head, you should make sure that you aren't suffering from a concussion. This is a serious injury that requires immediate medical attention. The hallmark of concussion is confusion or amnesia, sometimes preceded by the loss of consciousness. It may be difficult to evaluate yourself for a concussion, so someone else should check you for the following symptoms and seek medical help if a concussion is suspected.Loss of consciousness. Even if you only lose consciousness for a few seconds, this could be a sign of a serious injury and you should seek medical help immediately.
Severe headache.
Confusion, dizziness, and disorientation.
Nausea or vomiting.
Ringing in ears.
Slurred or labored speech.

, When you've properly evaluated the injury and ensured that there is no medical emergency, you can decide on the right course of treatment. For minor injuries, people often ask if heat or cold is the ideal treatment. Both are useful in different situations.Apply ice directly after an injury takes place. Usually within the first 48 hours of an injury, ice is the best treatment. It will help reduce swelling, pain, and signs of inflammation.
Heat is useful for sore muscles not associated with a specific injury. You can also apply heat to your muscles before an activity or sport that often makes you sore to loosen and warm them up.

, You have the option of using store-bought or homemade ice packs.


Store-bought ice packs include gel-based ice packs, which are kept in the freezer and are reusable; and instant cold packs, which get cold instantly and are for a single use.Homes and first aid kits should always have an ice pack on hand, but there are also a variety of homemade options you can choose from.
Try filling a plastic bag with ice cubes. Then fill it with just enough water to cover the ice cubes. Let out all the air before sealing the bag.Frozen vegetables can also be used as an ice pack. A good example is a bag of peas. These are able take on the shape of the area and can be taken in and out of the freezer., You should never apply ice directly to your skin. This can cause frostbite and nerve damage. To avoid injury, wrap the ice pack in a towel before applying it to your skin., While icing an injury, it helps to keep the area elevated. This will drain blood away from the wound and help cut down on swelling. The combination of icing and elevation will help fight inflammation., Icing is most effective when done immediately after the injury occurs, so move quickly.Press the ice pack down to ensure that the entire affected area receives adequate icing.If necessary, you can secure the ice pack with a non-stick bandage or wrap. Loosely wrap this around the ice pack and the injured area. Be sure not to tie this too tight, or you could cut off circulation. If the limb starts to turn blue/purple, the wrap is too tight and should be removed immediately.

, You should never keep ice on longer than 20 minutes. This can cause frostbite and other skin damage. Remove the ice and don't reapply until the skin has fully regained feeling.Never fall asleep while applying an ice pack. You could end up leaving it on for hours and damaging your skin. Set an alarm or have someone tell you when 20 minutes have passed.

, Continue alternating the treatment of 20 minutes on, two hours off, for three days or until swelling completely subsides., If the pain from the injury is making you uncomfortable, you can take OTC pain relievers to help.


NSAIDs are designed to fight swelling and inflammation. They include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve).Take any medication as labels indicate to prevent overdose.

, If you've been treating your injury with ice for three days and there is still swelling and no reduction in pain, you may have a fracture or dislocation that wasn't recognized. Visit the doctor to see if you have a more serious injury than you initially expected.

, The standard treatment for most acute injuries is called the RICE method. It is an acronym that stands for: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevate.By following these steps, you can help your injury heal quickly and efficiently.

, Injured body parts are susceptible to further damage, so you should keep the area rested for at least a few days while it heals. Avoid any strenuous activity until your wound is fully healed.Listen to your body. If an activity hurts, than you should avoid it until you feel better.

, Continue your icing regimen for at least three days after the injury. Sustained icing will eliminate inflammation and help the wound heal., Wrapping an elastic bandage around the wound will help keep the area immobile. This will help prevent further injury to the affected area.Make sure the wrapping is only snug, not tight. If you experience any tingling or numbness around the wrapping, it's too tight. Unwrap it and redo the wrapping more loosely.

, By keeping the wound elevated, you'll drain blood away from it. This will reduce swelling and inflammation, allowing the wound to heal faster.Ideally you should keep the injury elevated above your heart to ensure effective flow of blood away from the wound. If you have an injury to your back, try laying down with a pillow under the area.

Drink plenty of fluids.,
Wear light, loose fitting clothing.,
Protect yourself from sunburn.",How to Avoid Sunstroke2," One of the main reasons your body suffers from sunstroke is because it runs out of ways to cool itself. This happens when your body stops producing sweat, which is the way it naturally cools. In order to keep yourself hydrated so you can sweat properly and normalize your body temperature, you need to drink plenty of nourishing fluids. This includes while you are outside and when you come back in. Replenishing what you lost is very important.Water is the best thing to drink while you are outside or preparing to go outside. Also try sports drinks with added electrolytes if you are undergoing vigorous exercise outside.Make sure you start off the day with plenty of water when you know you are going to be outside. You want to already be hydrated when you go outside so you don't start off with less water than you need.
Do not drink alcoholic or caffeinated beverages because they cause dehydration.
Aim to drink at least a quart of fluids an hour, or a cup every 15 minutes., When you know you are going to be outside in the heat, make sure you wear clothes that are not constrictive. They should be lightweight and in a breathable material, such as cotton or linen. This will help keep your body cool and allow you to sweat properly.Make sure you do not wear too much clothing either. An overabundance of clothes can raise your body temperature unnecessarily.
Wear long sleeve shirts to protect your skin if you are going to be out in the direct sunlight for extended periods of time, but make sure any shirt or pants you wear are loose and allow your skin to breathe., Another way that you can develop sunstroke is through sunburn. This is because sunburn limits your body's ability to cool itself. To protect yourself from sunburn, wear sunscreen whenever you are going to be out in direct sunlight. Wear broad spectrum sunscreen that is at least SPF 30. Reapply throughout the day because the sunscreen will come off through sweat, water, and activity. This is especially true at the beach, even if you are under an umbrella. You can get sunburn from the sun's reflection off the sand.


Also wear hats and sunglasses if you are particularly sensitive or you want an extra layer of protection."
"
Look for the symptoms of heat exhaustion.,
Treat heat exhaustion.,
Seek immediate medical care.",How to Avoid Sunstroke3," Heat exhaustion is a serious but treatable condition that acts as a precursor for heat stroke in the majority of cases. In order to prevent sunstroke, be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion. These symptoms include nausea, fatigue, vomiting, headache, weakness, muscle cramps, muscle aches, and dizziness.


If you notice these symptoms early on, you can treat them and avoid progressing to sunstroke, which is much more serious and requires medical attention.

, If you notice the symptoms of heat exhaustion, treat them at home in order to prevent your condition from worsening. Get out of the heat immediately. Go into a cool, shady place, preferably one with air conditioning. Also drink plenty of water or fluids containing sugar and salt. This will help get your hydration back on track and raise your electrolyte levels. If you have on too many clothes, remove a few layers to allow your skin to breath. Try applying a cool cloth to your skin to help take down your body temperature.


Don't drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages. It will only make your condition worse.
If you do not feel better within 30 minutes to an hour, call your doctor., In some cases, individuals may skip heat exhaustion symptoms and go straight to sunstroke suddenly and without warning.You should seek immediate care if you suddenly have symptoms of sunstroke. These symptoms include high body temperature, a lack of sweating, red, hot, and flushed dry skin, difficulty breathing, rapid pulse, hallucinations, confusion, strange behavior, disorientation, agitation, and seizures.


In some rare cases, you can also slip into a coma.If someone you know is suffering from sunstroke, you can help cool them while you wait for emergency services. Get them indoors or into a shaded area, remove excess clothing, and cool the person by whatever means you can. This can include giving them a cool shower, spraying them with cool water, or giving the an ice pack or cold, wet towel on areas that regulate temperature, such as the head, neck, armpits, and groin."

Immediately apply 100% aloe vera, or, even better, pure aloe vera from a plant.,
Try the tea method.,
Consider eating foods with antioxidants and vitamin C. If the burn is very recent (still red and not peeling), try eating food full of antioxidants and vitamin C, such as blueberries, tomatoes, and cherries.,
Try calendula ointment.,
Apply witch hazel lotion.,
Use Egg Oil (Oleova).",How to Treat a Sunburn," Keep the water just below lukewarm (cool, but not tooth-chattering cold) and relax for 10 to 20 minutes. If showering, use a gentle stream of water, not a full blast, to avoid irritating your skin. Air dry or pat gently with a towel to avoid abrading the skin.


Avoid using soap, bath oils, or other detergents as you bathe or shower. Any such products can irritate your skin and possibly make the effects of the sunburn feel even worse.
If you have blisters forming on your skin, take a bath instead of showering. The pressure from the shower might pop your blisters.;
, Dampen a washcloth or other piece of fabric with cold water, and lay it over the affected area for 20 to 30 minutes. Re-wet it as often as you need to.

, Over-the-counter drugs such as Ibuprofen or aspirin can lessen the pain, and may or may not reduce inflammation.


Do not give aspirin to children. Instead, opt for something that is specifically marketed as a child's dose of acetaminophen. Child's Motrin (Ibuprofen) is a good option due to the possible anti-inflammatory effect.

, Drugstores also sell sprays meant to relieve red and itchy skin. Sprays that contain benzocaine, lidocaine or pramoxine have a numbing effect that may help with the pain.However, as these are potential allergens, it may be best to test the medication on an unaffected patch of skin first and wait a day to see if it causes itchiness or redness.These sprays should not be used on children 2 years of age or younger without a doctor's advice. Sprays containing methyl salicylate or trolamine salicylate may endanger children 12 and under, and capsaicin can be dangerous for people 18 and under, or for anyone with a chili allergy., Baggy t-shirts and loose cotton pajama pants are ideal clothing items to wear while you're recovering from a sunburn. If you can't wear loose clothing, at least make sure your garments are cotton (this fabric allows your skin to ""breathe"") and fit as loosely as possible.


Wool and some synthetic fabrics are especially irritating, due to scratchy fibers or trapped heat.

, Cortisone creams contain steroidal treatments that may reduce inflammation, although evidence suggests that they have little effect on sunburns. If you think it's worth a try, you can find low-dose, over-the-counter tubes at your local drugstore or supermarket. Look for hydrocortisone or something similar.


Do not use cortisone cream on young children, or in the face region. Ask your pharmacist for advice if you have any doubts or concerns about using this cream.
This medication cannot be sold as over the counter sunburn treatment in the United Kingdom., Ideally, you should hang out in the shade or wear clothing over affected areas if you're going back out into the sunshine.

, Use a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 whenever you go outside. Reapply every hour, after exposure to water or excessive sweat, or according to the product label.

, Sunburn can be dehydrating, so it's important to counterbalance this by drinking plenty of water while you recover. Eight to ten glasses of water a day are recommended while recovering, with each glass containing 1 cup (240mL) of water.

, When you no longer have open blisters or the redness of the sunburn has subsided a bit, you can safely use a moisturizing cream. Liberally apply a creamy, unscented moisturizer to sunburned areas over the next few days or weeks to prevent peeling and irritation.

, Call your local emergency number if you or a friend has one or more of these symptoms:


Too weak to stand
Confusion or inability to think clearly
Passed out

, If you're experiencing the following symptoms about your sunburn, visit a doctor as soon as you can.If any of these symptoms are debilitating, call an emergency number rather than waiting for an appointment.


Feeling weak
Feeling faint or dizzy
Headache or pain that doesn't respond to pain relief methods below
Rapid pulse or rapid breathing
Extreme thirst, no urine output, or sunken eyes
Pale, clammy, or cool skin
Nausea, fever, chills, or rash
Your eyes hurt and are sensitive to light
Severe, painful blisters, especially more than ½ in (1.25 cm) wide
Vomiting or diarrhea

, If you're experiencing the following symptoms, especially around a blister, your skin might be infected. Medical attention is vitally important.


Increased pain, swelling, redness, or warmth around the blister
Red streaks extending away from the blister
Drainage of pus from the blister
Swollen lymph nodes in your neck, armpit, or groin
Fever.

, It is possible, though rare, to get third-degree burns from the sun. If your skin looks charred, waxy and white, much darker brown, or raised and leathery, don't wait to call an emergency number. Raise the injured area above your heart while you wait, and move clothing to avoid it getting stuck to the burn, without undressing., Contact a doctor immediately if your skin is blistering from sunburn.This is a sign of severe sunburn that should be treated with personal medical advice, and the blisters put you at risk of infection. While waiting for an appointment, or if your doctor does not recommend any specific treatment, follow the precautions and general advice below.

, If your sunburn is serious, blistering ""bubbles"" of the skin may form. Do not attempt to pop them, and try to avoid rubbing or scraping them. Popped blisters can lead to infection and scarring.


If you absolutely cannot function with the blisters intact, visit a doctor and ask to have them popped in a safe, sterile context.

, Wash your hands with soap and water before adding or changing dressings to prevent infection. Small blisters can be covered with an adhesive bandage (plaster), while larger ones can be covered with a gauze pad or surgical dressing, taped gently into place with medical tape.Change the dressing daily until the blister has gone.

, Consider using an antibiotic ointment (such as polymyxin B or bacitracin) on your blisters if you suspect infection. Infection might manifest as a foul smell, yellow pus, or extra redness and irritation around the skin. Ideally, visit a doctor to receive a diagnosis and advice specific to your symptoms.


Note that some people are allergic to these ointments, so do a ""patch test"" on an unaffected area first and make sure you don't have a bad reaction.

, Do not tear off the flaps of skin left over from broken blisters. You'll shed them soon enough; don't risk irritating your skin even more now., The remedies below have not been sufficiently scientifically verified, and should not replace scientific medical treatment. Additional remedies not listed below may actually delay healing or encourage infection. Avoid egg whites, peanut butter, petroleum jelly, and vinegar in particular., This method, when applied immediately and often, can take away even the worst sunburns in a day or two.

, Brew three or four teabags in a pitcher of warm water. When the tea is almost black, remove the tea bags and let the liquid cool to room temp. Gently dab at the sunburn with a cloth soaked in the tea, the more, the better. Do not wash it off. If the cloth causes pain, dab at the burn with the teabags instead.Try to do this at bedtime and leave it on overnight.
Be aware that the tea can stain clothing and sheets.

, One study showed that this reduced the body’s need for fluids, lowering the risk for dehydration., Calendula ointment is considered by some to be especially good for severe burns with blistering.You can find it at a naturopathic store; ask the retailer or naturopath for advice. Be aware that no herbal treatment is appropriate for the treatment of serious injuries; if you have severe burns or blisters that won't heal, see a doctor immediately.

, This treatment may soothe your skin.Apply carefully to affected area and leave on.

, Egg oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids like Docosahexaenoic Acid. It also contains immunoglobulins, xanthophylls (lutein & zeaxanthin) and cholesterol. The omega-3 fatty acids in egg oil are bound to phospholipids which have the ability to form liposomes (nanoparticles), which may be able to penetrate deep and heal the dermis.


Massage the damaged skin with egg oil twice a day. Gently massage the area including the surrounding one-inch periphery for ten minutes during each of two daily sessions.
Leave it on for at least an hour, avoiding exposure to direct sunlight.
Wash off with a mild, pH neutral body wash. Avoid soap or any other alkaline substances.
Repeat twice a day until the skin is restored to its pre-burn condition.

Recognize a sea urchin sting.,
Know what parts are poisonous.,
Remove the spines.,
Remove the pedicellaria.,
Clean the wound with soap and water.,
Do not close the wound.,
Bathe the wound.,
Treat the wound before bed.,
Take antibiotics and painkillers.,
Watch for signs of infection.",How to Treat a Sea Urchin Sting," In order to treat a sea urchin sting, you must be certain you were stung by an urchin and not another marine animal.


Sea urchins have flat or globe shaped bodies and are covered in spines. They are found in oceans worldwide, but are more likely to be present in warmer regions.Sea urchins lurk in rocky parts of the water and will sting if threatened. Most people get stung when they accidentally step on an urchin.You can successfully manage most stings on your own. However, if you have difficulty breathing, nausea, chest pain, or signs of infection like redness and pus you should seek care immediately.You should also seek medical care if you were stung around a joint, as the spines may require surgical removal in such cases.;
, Sea urchins are flat, globe-shaped animals. While generally non-aggressive, urchins will sting if stepped on unintentionally.Certain parts of a sea urchins body release poison.


Sea urchins release venom through their spines and pedicellaria.
Spines produce puncture wounds and can stay in skin. They should be removed immediately in the event of an attack.The pedicellaria are seizing organs found between the spine that latch onto a target when an urchin is attacked. They should also be removed quickly after being stung., After being stung, remove the spines as quickly as possible to minimize your exposure to venom.


Use tweezers to pull out the protruding ends of large spines. Move slowly so that the spines does not break off, as medical treatment will be needed if this occurs.Hot wax can also be used to remove spines, if they are particularly deep and cannot be removed with a razor. Apply hot wax to the area, let dry, and remove. The spines should be pulled out with the wax.
Longterm medical problems can occur if spines are not removed properly. If you're not sure you got all the spines out yourself, see a doctor.

, The pedicellaria must also be removed after an attack to stop exposure to venom.


The pedicellaria can be removed by applying shaving cream to the infected area and then scraping it off with a razor.Be gentle with how you handle the razor as not to cause further distress to the wound.

, As soon as you have removed the spines and pedicellariae, you need to clean and flush the wound.


This will be uncomfortable as your wound is still sore and will sting to the touch. Be prepared to work through the pain or have someone assist you if you're worried about not being able to tolerate the discomfort.You can also use hydrogen peroxide or betadine solutions instead of soap.Rinse the area thoroughly with clean drinking water after washing., Bandages and tape should not be used to seal the wound. Any embedded spines not removed with tweezers need to work their way out of the skin to avoid bacterial infections and effects of the urchin's venom., To treat the pain and minimize chances of infection, some people bathe their wound after the initial cleaning.


You can submerge the wound in hot water. The water should be hot to the touch but not boiling. Keep the wound in the water for at least an hour or as long as you can tolerate the heat. This will help ease the pain and dissolve any remaining spines. You can add Epsom salt or magnesium sulfate compound to the water to aid in this process.Some people try a hot vinegar bath. Mix a small amount of vinegar in a tub of hot water and soak for 20 to 40 minutes. You can also add Epsom salt to the water, as this will help the remaining spines dissolve.

, Before you go to bed, you should put a small dressing on the wound to avoiding irritating it overnight.


Place a vinegar soaked cloth over the wound and wrap it in plastic wrap. Tape the plastic wrap on so it stays secure.
Keep the dressing loose, however. Remember, you don't want to close up the wound completely as the remaining spines need to work their way out.

, To ward off infection and treat any lingering pain, over-the-counter antibiotics and painkillers should be taken as instructed.


Topical antibiotic ointment, available at most drug stores and supermarkets, should be applied on the wound. While this should be done in any case as a precaution, it's especially important if you notice redness or swelling.Tylenol and ibuprofen are good choices to manage the pain. You should take the recommended dose every 4 to 8 hours until symptoms lessen., While sea urchin wounds usually heal well if treated properly, urchins are venomous. Know the signs of infection.


Signs of infection include redness, pus, swelling of the affected area or of the lymph glands that drain the affected area (neck, underarms, or groin), or heat.Seek medical care if signs of infection do not clear up within a few days.
If you develop any breathing problems or chest pain, the infection may be severe and you should go to your nearest emergency room."

Find the head of the tick.,
Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible with a pair of tweezers.,
Pull firmly and steadily outward.,
Wash with warm water and soap.,
See a doctor if you have trouble removing the tick.",How to Remove a Tick1," If you look closely you'll see its mouth attached to the skin, with the body resting behind it.

, Use tweezers with fine tips, rather than blunt ones, to make sure you are able to grasp the tick tightly.









Don't try this with your fingers. You won't be able to get a good, tight grip on the tick.
Make sure you're gripping the tick's head. Get the tweezers as close to the mouth of the tick as possible.
Do not grasp the tick's body. This will cause it to inject saliva or blood into your skin and increase the chances of transmitting a disease.

, The tick's mouth will release the skin. Do not twist, jerk or wiggle the tweezers as you pull, or the tick's mouth parts will remain attached to the skin. It's not uncommon for the skin to also pull up as the tick detaches, much like it does when you pluck a stray hair.









If the mouth parts remain attached, attempt to remove them with the tweezers. If they're buried in the skin, you can simply let the skin heal, checking it from time to time to make sure it doesn't become infected., You can also use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine. Clean both the bite and your hands thoroughly., Some ticks are so small that they're difficult to remove using this common method. A doctor will be able to remove the tick for you.

Recognize a bite from a black widow spider.,
Capture the spider if possible.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Initiate treatment.,
Seek medical care.,
Use the antivenom, Antivenin Latrodectus Mactans.,
Identify the black widow spider without disturbing it.,
Spot possible places where they like to live.,
Try not to disturb the web.,
Differentiate the males from the females.",How to Identify and Treat Black Widow Spider Bites," Black widow spiders have fangs. When bitten, two small puncture wounds are usually visible.As the venom from the bite spreads, the area develops a target-like appearance. The fang marks are in the center, surrounded by an area of reddened skin, then another circle of red just a little further beyond the center.
The fang marks are visible immediately. Redness and swelling of the area where the bite occurred develops rapidly, usually within an hour.
Pain typically starts within the hour and can quickly spread from the site to systemic areas such as the abdomen, chest area, or back.
This is not always the case, but this is the classic description for the pattern that develops from a black widow spider bite.;
, The treating physician will want to know what caused the bite/sting/injury. Safety is always the priority. If you can safely capture the spider, place it a container that does not present a risk of injury to anyone else. A small glass jar or plastic container with a lid, placed inside another container with a secured lid and handle, such as a small cooler, can help to make it easy to transport the spider.Clearly no one needs to be put at risk of being bitten. If it can be done safely, capture the spider and safely take it with you to the medical facility.
Presenting the spider that did the biting can help in initiating the most effective treatment as quickly as possible. Carrying around a black widow spider might not be the best plan, so at least take very clear pictures of whatever bit you, if you can do so safely.

, Most people that are bitten by a spider, including a venomous one like a black widow, do not have any serious medical problems as a result.Symptoms that can result from a black widow bite include severe and intense pain, stiffness, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, back pain, excessive sweating, and hypertension.
Both topical and systemic reactions to the venom from a black widow spider can develop and spread quickly. Seek treatment as soon as possible once you confirm, or are fairly sure, you were bitten by a black widow spider.
Topical reactions include itching or rash at the site, sweating of the extremity where you were bitten, pain radiating from the site, and discolored areas of the skin that form blisters.
Systemic reactions include severe and intense muscle pain, pain radiating to the back and chest area, sweating, difficulty breathing, headache, nausea and vomiting, fever and chills, elevated blood pressure, and anxiety, restlessness, and delirium.

, The first step in treatment is to stay calm and safely identify the spider.Wash the area with mild soap and water and use ice applications or a cold cloth to help prevent swelling.
Do not apply ice directly to the skin. Use a towel or soft and clean cloth between the skin and the ice-filled baggie or cold pack.
Elevate the area that was bitten if possible and practical.
Take an over-the-counter product to help with pain and/or inflammation such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin. Be sure to follow the directions on the label.

, According to reports from poison control centers in the United States, more than 2500 incidents of black widow spider bites are reported each year in the United States. Go to an urgent care clinic or hospital emergency room.You may want to call your regular doctor and inform him or her of the situation. Your doctor may want you to come straight to the office or have a preference as to the medical facility you go to. Wherever you end up going, inform them that you are on your way and that you were bitten by a black widow spider — this will give the staff ample time to prepare.
Do not attempt to drive yourself to the hospital. The venom from the bite can alter your responses abruptly. You may feel lucid when you start driving, but your condition can change quickly.
Most people do not experience severe reactions from a black widow spider bite. In fact, some people have no problems at all and do not need medical care.
Due to the possibility of severe pain, discomfort, and systemic changes, talk with your doctor as soon as possible or go to an emergency room or urgent care clinic to be sure you can receive prompt treatment should you develop any adverse effects or complications.
Inform the doctor at the treatment facility of all medications or treatment steps taken upon arrival.
Fortunately, only three cases of death have been recorded over many years.
Some reports of serious complications and death have been linked to black widow bites in people that were already severely medically compromised.

, The antivenom has been available since the 1920’s. At least one case report of a severe hypersensitivity reaction has limited the use of the antivenom in the United States.


Complications from the bite are possible. A medical facility can monitor your vital signs and changes in your condition to determine if treatment is warranted.
An article published in 2011 reviewed four cases of black widow spider bites. Three of the people bitten were treated with the antivenom and one was not due to concerns over hypersensitivity.
The three people treated with the antivenom experienced relief from the severe pain caused by the bites in a short period of time, usually with 30 minutes of receiving the injection. All three people were observed for a few hours in the emergency treatment facility then discharged to home without further complications.
The person that did not receive the antivenom was treated with strong pain and anti-inflammatory medications in the emergency department, then required admission to the hospital.
The person received treatment in the hospital for two days, then began to feel better by the third day. He was discharged to home on the third day without further complications.

, The unique marking of a female black widow spider is the bright red hourglass shape on the underneath part of its abdomen.The female spider has a black and shiny body with a large and round abdomen. The body is about 1 and ½ inches in length, and the entire spider, legs and all, is more than 1 inch across.
They have fangs that are a little shorter than those of other spiders, yet still long enough to penetrate human skin.
Black widow spiders are reported to be commonly found in the southern and western regions of the United States. Other sources and statistics report frequent sightings as far west as California, all along the eastern seaboard, south to Florida, and north as far as Okanagan in BC and central Alberta in Canada.

, Black widows like to live outside where there are plenty of flies to feed on; however, they can be found inside structures and shelters.They prefer undisturbed places such as woodpiles, under simulated rock well covers, the eaves of a house, around fences, and other areas where debris piles up.
Watch for black widows in dark, moist, and undisturbed places like meter boxes, under porches, porch furniture, and inside and around barns and sheds.

, Black widow spiders like to make their webs between objects that are solid and stationary. Some spiders prefer to make their webs in locations that are more flexible, like between shrubbery and tree branches.The black widow’s webs are purposefully made in an irregular shape, not like the typical and sometimes practically perfect webs made by other spiders. The fibers of the web are stronger than those found in most spider webs.
They don’t prey on human skin. Most bites occur when their webs are disturbed.
They are not aggressive but will bite when they feel trapped or are touched.

, The females have the classic markings and the more potent venom. If you are bitten by a female black widow, then you need prompt medical attention.The body of a female is usually larger in size than a male black widow spider, however the legs of a male are often longer. This can make the overall size of the male appear larger.
Males can be black but are usually brown in color, and the markings can be anywhere on the abdomen. The red is typical yet some males have markings that are white or brownish.
The female has the traditional hourglass red shape on the abdomen, but this can appear more orange than red in some females.
Females have fangs large enough to penetrate human skin and deliver enough venom to create a systemic reaction.
Bites from male black widow spiders are not considered to be capable of delivering venom.
The black widow spider was named for the tendency of the female to eat the male after mating. This is not the always the case, but it is a real possibility.

Identify the cat.,
Seek medical treatment for scratches from an unknown cat.,
Assess the wound.,
Decide on an appropriate treatment.",How to Deal With a Cat Scratch1," It is important to have some information about the cat that has scratched you. If he is your cat or the cat of a family member or close friend, you can consider him a “household cat.” You can likely treat the wound on your own if it is not too severe and you know the following information about the cat to be true:The cat is fully vaccinated.
The cat is in generally good health.
The cat spends most of its time indoors.;
, Unknown cats may not have vaccines, so you may need to have preventative treatment for bacterial infections, tetanus, or rabies. Particularly if the scratch was accompanied by a bite (which has about an 80% chance of becoming infected), you will need to seek medical attention from a physician.

, The severity of the wound from the scratch will dictate the appropriate treatment. Any cat scratch can be painful, but the depth of the scratch will determine the severity of the wound.


A shallow wound that involves the uppermost layer of skin but involves minimal bleeding can be considered superficial.
A deeper scratch injury that pierces several layers of skin and bleeds moderately should be considered serious., Superficial wounds from known household cats can be treated at home. However, any scratch from an unknown cat and serious (deep) scratches from household cats should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.

Dispose of the tick properly.,
Consider saving the tick for testing.,
Check the wound site for symptoms.",How to Remove a Tick4," The tick will probably still be alive when you remove it. You can soak it in rubbing alcohol or flush it down the toilet to prevent it from attaching itself to you or your loved ones., If ticks in your area are known to frequently carry Lyme disease, you might want to save the tick in case you need to get it tested. Place it in a plastic food storage bag, seal the bag, then put it in the freezer. Find a lab that does tick testingand follow instructions for properly submitting the tick.

, In the weeks following the tick removal, check the site for signs that you may have contracted Lyme Disease or another tick-borne illness. you'll need to tell your doctor when you noticed the tick, when you removed it, and what subsequent symptoms you notice. If you notice the following symptoms developing, see a doctor immediately:A fever and/or chills. This is a common symptom of tick-borne illnesses.
Headaches and muscle aches.
The tell-tale bulls-eye rash. This is a symptom of Lyme disease as well as Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI).
Any other type of rash. Rock Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF), also carried by ticks, can cause a rash that does not look like a bulls-eye to appear.

If there’s swelling in the area of the bug bite, you can put a cold compress or ice pack on the bite to help reduce the swelling. The cold will also temporarily help relieve the pain and itching.Apply a cold compress or ice pack for a maximum of 10 minutes at a time. After the 10 minutes of application, leave it off for another 10 minutes. Do this rotation for up to an hour.;
, The bite area will most likely be itchy and you will be tempted to scratch — don’t. Do your absolute best to resist the urge to scratch. Unfortunately, scratching a bug bite can make things worse by causing an infection., If the bite continues to be itchy, you can apply calamine lotion, a topical antihistamine, or a corticosteroid cream to help relieve it. All of these lotions and creams are available as over-the-counter medications at your local pharmacy. If you aren’t sure which one might work best for you, talk to your pharmacist., You can take acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol), ibuprofen (i.e. Advil), or an antihistamine (e.g. Claritin) orally if you need to relieve the pain or itching.If you take a daily allergy medication, be careful if you want to take an additional antihistamine. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you can increase the dose, or combine it safely with another type of medication.

, Combine warm water and baking soda in a bowl until it turns into a paste. Apply the paste directly to the insect bite. This should help alleviate the itching temporarily. Wash the baking soda paste off after 15 to 20 minutes.In general, this paste should contain three parts baking soda and one part water.

, Yes, you read that right! Mix a non-seasoned meat tenderizer with warm water until it forms a paste. Apply that paste directly to the insect bite to help ease the itching. Wash the paste off after 15 to 20 minutes., Steep a tea bag for a short time in warm water, then apply the wet tea bag to the insect bite to help relieve the itching. If you used the tea bag for an actual cup of tea first, make sure it’s cooled down enough before putting it on your skin. Leave the tea bag on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes., There are several fruits and vegetables that contain enzymes that may help reduce swelling and itching. Try one of the following options:Papaya — Lay a slice on the bug bite for an hour.
Onion — Rub a slice of onion on the bug bite.
Garlic — Crush a clove of garlic and apply the garlic to the bug bite.

, Immediately after the bite has happened, soak the area in apple cider vinegar (if possible) for a few minutes. When the bite is still bothering you, pour apple cider vinegar on a cotton ball, and tape the cotton ball on top of the bug bite with a bandaid., Use a spoon or a mortar and pestle to crush a pill of aspirin. Add some water to turn the powder into a paste, then apply the paste to the bite. You can leave the paste on your skin (similar to what you would do with calamine lotion) and wash it off when you have your next shower or bath., Put one drop of tea tree oil onto the bite once day. This may not help with the itching, but it may help reduce and eliminate the swelling.As an alternative, use one to two drops of lavender or peppermint oil to help stop the itching.

, There are some homeopathic remedies that have been shown to work on bug bites. But which ones should be used and how much is based on each individual person. Visit a homeopath, or a homeopathic store, for assistance on selecting the best possible option for you."

Wash your hands.,
Rinse the wound.,
Wash the scratched area.,
Apply ointment to the scratch.,
Leave the scratch uncovered.",How to Deal With a Cat Scratch2," Before working with the area that suffered a scratch, be sure that your hands are clean and disinfected. Wash your hands using soap and warm (or hot) water for at least 20 seconds. Be sure to clean between your fingers and under your fingernails. Then rinse your hands well with clean water., Use clean running water from your faucet to rinse the cat scratch and the area around it.Avoid overly hot water, which may worsen any bleeding that is present.

, Carefully wash the area of the scratch with a gentle soap. Try to wash areas near the wound as well as the scratch itself (for example, if the scratch is on your forearm, it may be helpful to wash your entire forearm, not the scratch alone.) After washing, rinse completely with clean water from the faucet.Do not scrub the wounded area during washing, as this could add further injury (bruising) to the injured tissues.

, You should treat the scratch with an antiseptic ointment.A triple antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin can be used; these ointments contain neomycin, an antibiotic that is very effective in allowing cut injuries to heal.Triple antibiotic ointment can be applied to the wound three times daily.Bacitracin is a good alternative for anyone who has an allergy to common triple antibiotic ointments.
Oral antibiotics should not be necessary for a superficial scratch from a housecat., The scratch wound should be fairly superficial if you are treating it at home, so there should be no need to bandage the area. Keep the scratch clean while it heals, but allow it to be exposed to fresh air.

Seek medical treatment.,
Stop the bleeding.,
Wash the scratch area.,
Dry the wound.,
Cover the scratch wound.",How to Deal With a Cat Scratch3," Deeper wounds can involve profuse bleeding and may necessitate the use of oral antibiotics to prevent infection, even from a fully vaccinated cat.You will typically be prescribed Augment 875/125 mg, to be taken twice daily for 7 to 10 days.


Before seeking treatment from a medical professional, you may want begin treatment at home.
Be sure to go to the doctor after taking the following steps to treat the wound.

, If the wound is bleeding heavily, apply pressure to the area with a clean towel. Press the towel firmly to the bleeding area and hold in place until the bleeding subsides. You may also need to elevate the wound above your head., After washing your hands thoroughly, gently wash the wounded area with soap and rinse with clean water.Do not scrub while you are washing, as this may restart the bleeding.

, Use a second clean towel to completely dry the wound and the area around the scratch.

, Deep wounds should be covered (or closed) using an adhesive bandage (a Band-Aid), a butterfly bandage, or clean gauze dressings.If the wound is wide, bring the edges of the wound together so that there is no gap between them and apply a butterfly bandage, which should pinch the cut together. Apply several butterfly bandages as necessary to close the edges of the wound together, which will facilitate proper and quick healing.
If you do not have adhesive bandages, you can cover the area with gauze dressing, keeping it in place with medical tape.

Avoid infection.,
Watch out for cat scratch disease.,
Determine whether you have ringworm.,
Assess your risk for toxoplasmosis.,
Look for symptoms of other diseases.",How to Deal With a Cat Scratch4," Some scratch wounds and most bite wounds from cats can become infected. Cleaning the wound well and applying an antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin or Bacitracin can greatly reduce risk of infection. An infected wound may require oral antibiotics as well. Signs of an infected wound include:Increased pain, swelling, redness, or warmth around the wound
Presence of red streaks extending from the wound
Drainage of pus from the wound
Presence of a high fever

, Cat scratch disease, the commonest disease spread by cats, is caused by the bacteria Bartonella henselae. Cats act as a reservoir for the disease, and it's especially prevalent among young cats and cats with fleas. About 40% of cats carry the bacteria at some point in their lives, but will show no sign of carrying the disease.Some cats who have cat scratch disease can develop heart disease, ulceration in their mouths, or eye infections. The first sign of cat scratch disease in humans is usually a small swelling at the region of the cat scratch or bite, followed by enlarged lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck. Next is a fever, fatigue, red eye, joint pain, and sore throat. Untreated cat scratch disease in humans can cause severe eye, brain, liver, or spleen damage. Immuno-compromised people are at higher risk of experiencing complications or even death from cat scratch fever.
The diagnosis of cat scratch disease is usually by B henselae serology but can be diagnosed by culture, histopathology, or polymerase chain reaction. It is treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin, rifampin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin or bactrim., Ringworm is a fungal infection characterized by round, puffy, and scaly patches of skin.Ringworm is often accompanied by a severe itch.
Ringworm can be treated with antifungal ointments such as miconazole or clotrimazole.

, Toxoplasmosis is a parasite that cats carry and pass through their feces. It is possible to catch the toxoplasmosis parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, through a cat scratch, particularly if traces of feces were present on the cat’s claws.Infected humans can experience fever, body aches, and enlarged lymph nodes. Severe cases can cause damage to the brain, eyes, or lungs, and an infection can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women. Therefore, pregnant women should avoid tending to the litter box or cat feces during pregnancy.
Treatment for toxoplasmosis involves taking an antiparasitic drug such as pyrimethamine., Cats can carry life-threatening diseases. Contact your physician immediately if you have received any cat scratch and develop any of the following symptoms:


Fever
Swelling of the head or neck
Red, itchy, or scaly patches of skin
Severe headaches, lightheadedness, or dizziness

Do not punish a cat for scratching you.,
Clip your cat’s claws.,
Avoid rough play.,
Adopt an older cat.",How to Deal With a Cat Scratch5," A cat’s scratching is a normal defensive behavior, and punishing a cat for scratching can lead to further aggression in the future.

, You can trim a cat’s claws at home with regular nail clippers. Clipping a cat’s claws once a week can minimize damage from future scratches., Try not to play roughly or aggressively with your cat or kitten. This may encourage them to bite and scratch you and other humans.

, Most cats outgrow excessive biting and scratching once they pass from a juvenile to an adult cat, between 1 and 2 years of age. If you are sensitive to cat scratches or are immuno-compromised, you should consider adopting an older cat as a pet instead of a kitten."

Make fire extinguishers accessible.,
Have a first-aid kit.,
Set your hot water heater’s thermostat.,
Get trained in first-aid.,
Tie your hair back and wear fitted clothing.",How to Prevent Kitchen Burns1," Whether you’re in a home or commercial kitchen, you need to have access to a fire extinguisher. Fire extinguishers do exactly what their name suggests – they extinguish fires with a chemical foam that prevents fires from obtaining more oxygen. These are an excellent tool and can prevent small fires turning in to big fires, but remember, your food won’t be edible after you use an extinguisher.Commercial kitchens will need to follow their city’s code requirements about how many extinguishers are needed and where they should be located.
Typically an extinguisher is kept below the kitchen sink in a home kitchen.;
, You should have an accessible first-aid kit whether you’re cooking in a commercial or home kitchen. At the minimum, your kit should contain plenty of sterile gauze, bandages, a first-aid burn gel, and scissors to cut away any clothing that might be touching the burned area. Periodically check your kit to make sure that the contents are still there and that they aren’t expired.Cities will have requirements about what your commercial first-aid kit should contain.

, Lower your hot water heater’s thermostat to 120 – 125 degrees so that water from the faucet won’t scald you. Water heated above this temperature can cause scalding burns, and is an unsafe temperature, especially if there are children in the house.Turning down the temperature on your hot water heater will also save you money. The higher the temperature, the more your water heater has to work to keep the water heated at such a high temperature.
Consider installing anti-scald devices on tubs or faucets that children can access.

, Whether you’re in a commercial or home kitchen, it’s a great idea to have someone trained in first aid present at all times. If this is a home kitchen, that person will be you, of course. Being trained in first aid will show you a variety of life-saving techniques, and also teach you how to identify and treat burns., Make sure that your hair is not hanging down, exposed to any sort of flame or heat, and that your clothes fit relatively close to your body. Baggy or loose clothing can ignite easily because it hangs much closer to heat sources than the rest of your body. While clothing fires aren’t typical, they do account for 18% of fire-related fatalities.If you have long hair, consider keeping a head scarf, hair tie, or hair net in the kitchen to use when you cook.

Use calendula salve, lavender oil, goldenseal ointment, or tea tree oil on your cut.",How to Treat a Paper Cut," Cool water can help take the sting out of the cut.;
, Be gentle with your wound. Scrubbing too hard can open up the paper cut further.

,


In the absence of cool, running tap water, utilize a bulb syringe or poke a hole in a plastic bottle and squeeze.

, The properties that kill bacteria can also damage healthy cell tissue. While they rarely cause serious harm, they could slow your rate of healing., If the cut is bleeding a lot or it doesn't stop quickly, stop it by applying gentle pressure with a clean washcloth or bandage., Keep it clean. The air will help dry it out and within a day you’ll hardly remember it happened.

, It will easily heal on its own. However, sometimes bandages lessen the pain and make it easier for you to go about your day.

, While they do not help the wound heal faster, they discourage infection and encourage the body’s healing process.Some ingredients in antibiotic cream or ointments can cause an adverse, mild rash. If you see any sign of a rash, discontinue the use of the ointment.

, Use a clean bandage, especially if it is in an area that gets dirty easily, like your fingers or hand. This will limit the amount of bacteria you come into contact with. This will also protect you from knocking the wound open.Put your adhesive strip on snug, but not so tight you will restrict blood flow to your wound. You want your blood to have access to the wound to better heal you!

, You want to keep the area as clean as possible to encourage healing.

, Some products offer a topical anesthetic that helps to alleviate some of the pain. Check the pharmacy for those made specifically for minor skin wounds.


Super glue products can sting, but also cover the wound and dry to hold the edges of the skin together. These products are not intended to be used directly on skin, so they will sting and cause some burning if you choose to utilize this method.

, For most paper cuts, healing only takes a few days. Leaving the bandage on too long can prevent the cut from getting the oxygen it needs to heal properly.

, It’s important that the honey is raw; if it’s cooked, all the antibacterial enzymes are removed from it.


Home remedies are not substitutes for medical attention if you need it. The things in this section are simply things to try that may, according to some sources, help your cut to feel better faster. You still need to wash the cut properly, use precautions for preventing infection (cover the wound while it’s unhealed), and seek medical attention if it becomes infected.

, You can also use commercially purchased gel. Aloe vera is known for speeding up the healing process.

, Warm a mint teabag in boiling water, then lay the teabag across the paper cut. Or, stick your whole finger in cooled mint tea if the cut is on your finger. Mint has a soothing effect on inflamed tissue., Blend 3 cloves of garlic with one cup of wine, let stand for 2-3 hours and then strain. Apply to the cut with a clean cloth 1-2 times a day.

, All of these can be found in most health stores, and are known to help wounds to heal faster. Apply them directly to the cut or to your bandage 2-4 times a day.

Beware of common dispersal methods for bioterrorism agents.,
Keep up-to-date on emerging pathogen threats.,
Research bio-weapons.,
Report suspicious activities to the authorities.,
Stockpile supplies.,
Protect yourself in the event of an attack.",How to Recognize Category C Bioterrorism Agents," One of the biggest challenges that would-be bio-terrorists face is finding a way to administer their biological agents in ways that preserve the lethality of the agents themselves. Many dangerous microbes are difficult to grow and cultivate, while still others are fragile and die when exposed to air or light. Know the most common delivery methods for bioterrorism agents (listed below) so that, in the event of an attack, you will be better prepared to protect yourself.


Food and water contamination: Certain bioterrorism agents can persist in food and water, especially if consumed unheated. Thoroughly cooking food and boiling water can help kill these pathogens.
Animal transmission: Some animals, especially pests like mosquitoes and ticks, can be vectors for deadly diseases. Keeping pest-control agents (insecticides, etc.) is a smart choice to protect against this dispersal method.
Person-to-person transmission: Diseases like smallpox spread extremely contagiously simply from person-to-person contact. In these cases, physically staying away from infected people (via quarantine, for instance) is the best move.
Aerosol transmission: In perhaps the most dangerous method of transmission, a few bioterrorism agents (like anthrax) can be converted to a fine mist and spread through the air, where they can drift for miles and cause infection upon inhalation. In this case, closing windows and doors and using a proper gas mask can help prevent infection.

, Category C contains many emerging pathogens - that is, infectious diseases that have recently had an increased incidence in humans or otherwise are poised for such an increase.Keeping up-to-speed on the status of these types of diseases worldwide can allow you to be aware of likely bioterrorism agents before they're used.


Luckily, the website of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) provides up-to-date information on the status of emerging diseases across the globe.The CDC also provides a report called the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), an excellent source for monitoring emerging disease outbreaks., Understanding the history of bio-weapon development is useful for understanding the current threat. Agents that have been mass produced or engineered in the past are more likely to surface in the future, even if these stock piles have been destroyed. Dissemination of biological agents is a complex, sophisticated process, so, by researching historical accounts of the usage of such agents, the dangers and limitations of Category C agents can become more apparent.


Great reading resources include; ""The Anthrax Letters” by Dr. Leonard A. Cole, “Rising Plague: The Global Threat from Deadly Bacteria and Our Dwindling Arsenal to Fight Them” by Brad Spellberg, “Bioterrorism and Infectious Agents: A New Dilemma for the 21st Century” edited by Ken Alibek, and “Biohazard” by Ken Alibek.

, If you believe you may have information about a biological attack, even if it's far-fetched, it's better to be safe than sorry. Suspicious activity, especially around hospitals, medical waste facilities, and similar places should be reported to the authorities immediately. Odd or suspicious letters and packages should be turned over to the police without being opened. Be vigilant for other threats - if you're able to quickly report a bioterrorism attack, you may save many lives.

, In the event of a biological attack, it may be impossible to leave the house for some time. Thus, it's important that your family has what it needs to survive without help from the outside world. There are many resources for emergency planning which you may want to consult, as the necessary supplies and procedures are generally the same regardless of the emergency. Here are just a few things you may want to have:


Sealed, non-perishable food
Sealed, purified water
A secure quarantine area (for instance, a specific part of your house)
HEPA Air filters (for aerosol attacks)
Flashlights and batteries
Radio
Toiletries
Soap
Access to a toilet or latrine
Over-the-counter medicine

, If you experience a bioterrorism attack, do everything you can to protect yourself and your loved ones from possible exposure. The key here is prevention - being ready for an attack well in advance is the best way to be able to survive. Have a plan to quickly gather your loved ones in a quarantined area (like your house) where you'll have access to supplies, like gas masks, hazard suits, and a radio or television (so that you'll be able to know when the threat passes).


Practice your quarantine plan like you would with a fire drill. Everyone in your family should know exactly where to go and what to do in the event of a biological attack. If the real thing ever occurs, every second may count.

Avoid areas where chiggers reside.,
Dress appropriately.,
Apply sulfur powder or vinegar to your socks and shoes.,
Apply insect repellent.,
Check your body for chiggers and take a shower.",How to Prevent Chigger Bites1," The easiest way to prevent chigger bites, is to avoid the areas where chiggers are likely to reside. Chigger larvae are common in areas with tall grasses and weeds, these include roadside ditches, pastures, woodlots, and meadows. Chiggers also inhabit moist low-lying areas.If you cannot avoid these areas, take the proper precautions and do not sit down on the ground., Chiggers tend to bite humans in tender, soft, and moist areas, such as the groin, back of the knee, and and armpits. Wearing the correct clothing can prevent chigger larvae from arriving at these areas. When you venture into an area that is likely infested with chiggers, wear a long sleeved shirt and a pair of pants. Tuck your pants into your socks and boots., Chiggers are driven away by potent smells. If you can handle the smell of sulfur or vinegar, consider apply these natural chigger repellents to your clothing and shoes.Sprinkle your clothing and shoes with sulfur powder.Pour 1 tablespoon of sulfur powder into a sealable plastic bag. Place your socks in the bag, seal, and shake. Once the sulfur powder has coated your socks, remove them from the bag and put them on your feet.Pour vinegar into a spray bottle and spray your feet, legs, and midsection., Insect repellents effectively keep chiggers at bay. Spray the repellent around the openings of your clothing or shoes, such as near your shirt collar and around the tops of your shoes. Reapply as needed and recommended.


Before using DEET, permethrin, or less potent repellents, always read the product instructions and warnings., When you have spent time in an area that may be infested with chiggers, you can prevent bites by thoroughly checking your body for the mites. After undressing, check the soft, tender areas of your body for chiggers that have attached to your skin and scan your body for fast-moving red dots. If you find chiggers on yourself, take a hot shower immediately. Scrub your skin thoroughly with soap to dislodge and wash away the chiggers.If you find chiggers or discover chigger bites on yourself, wash the clothing you were wearing and any blankets you used in hot water."

Unplug the earbuds from your listening device.,
Find an unused toothbrush you can use to clean your earbuds.,
Gently scrub the earbuds.,
Wash the toothbrush or throw it away.",How to Clean Earbuds1," A toothbrush can be used to quickly brush away light debris and dried-on residue. Before you get started, disconnect your earbuds from your phone, tablet or mp3 player. This will prevent your device from coming into contact with water, soap or any other substances during the cleaning process that could potentially ruin it. Set the device aside and take the earbuds to an area where they can be cleaned safely.;
, Dig up an old, unused toothbrush, or buy a new one cheaply. You’ll be using the toothbrush to scrub your dirty earbuds, so make sure it’s clean and dry. The stiffer the bristles on the toothbrush, the better.


Toothbrushes with nylon bristles are best. Since nylon breaks up static electricity, you won’t have to worry about damaging the internal workings of the earbuds.The bristles of the toothbrush will be long and narrow enough to penetrate into the mesh covering the ear openings, making it one of the safest ways to clean and maintain them.

, Go over the outer surface of the earbuds with the toothbrush using light, circular sweeping motions. Brush away as much dried-on earwax, dirt, pocket lint and other debris that you can. This method works best for headphones that are only used every once in awhile and haven’t accumulated lots of mess. Once you’re done, the earbuds should be gunk-free and ready for use.While cleaning around the ear openings, be careful not to brush too hard. You might end up pushing the earwax and debris further into the openings, making it hard, or even impossible, to clean.
You might also scrub your earbuds with a toothbrush to prepare them for being cleaned with other products.

, Chuck the toothbrush in the garbage if you don’t intend to use it again. If you do, you can put it through the dishwasher or boil it for a few minutes to sanitize it. Your ears contain a lot of germs, both naturally-occurring and picked up from other objects and surfaces, so it’s always best to either clean or dispose of the toothbrush after you’ve used it to clean things. earbuds.Boiling or washing a toothbrush can cause the bristles to soften, but the heat will eliminate any bacteria on it and make it useable again.

Look for ticks.,
Remove the tick.,
Save the tick.,
Go to the doctor.,
Wash the area of the tick bite.,
Submit the tick for testing.",How to Get Rid of Bug Bites2," Ticks live outdoors and are very small. Unlike other bugs, they don’t just bite and leave. They embed themselves into the skin and continue to feed off their human host. They like small, hairy areas like: the scalp, behind the ear, in the armpit or groin, between fingers and toes. When checking for ticks, start in these areas, but check your whole body just to be sure., The tick must be removed from its human host. The person who has been bitten will likely need assistance from another person, especially if the tick is someplace hard to reach. Do not touch the tick with bare hands.If you are alone, nervous, unsure, or do not have the proper tools, go to a health care practitioner to have the tick removed. Unless a serious allergic reaction is involved, you do not need to go to the ER.
Grab the tick, by its mouth or head, with a pair of tweezers.
Grab the tick as close to the skin as you possibly can.
Do not squeeze the tick with the tweezers.
Pull up on the tick slowly and gently in a straight direction — do not twist.
Do not use things like: petroleum jelly, solvents, knives, or matches.
If the tick breaks apart, make sure to remove any remaining parts from the skin.
Do not discard the tick, even if it breaks apart.

, Yes, you should keep the tick temporarily. Because ticks can carry diseases like Lyme disease, you may wish to have the tick tested if you show signs of Lyme disease, or even if you don't. If it tests positive for anything, you may need additional medical treatment.Place the tick in a plastic baggie or small container (e.g. empty pill bottle, etc.).
If the tick is still alive, store it in the fridge for up to 10 days.If the tick is dead, store it in the freezer for up to 10 days.
If you aren’t able to submit the tick within 10 days, throw it out. Even frozen or refrigerated the tick won’t be viable for testing after 10 days.

, If the tick is embedded deep in the skin, or someone was only able to remove a portion of the tick, you’ll need to go to the doctor and have it removed. You should also go to your doctor if you have any of the symptoms of Lyme disease.The most common initial sign of Lyme disease is a bulls-eye pattern rash.
Other common symptoms of Lyme disease are: fatigue, fever or chills, headaches, spasms or weakness, numbness or tingling, swollen lymph nodes, and/or a skin rash.In more severe cases, the person may also experience: impaired cognitive function, nervous system disorders, arthritic symptoms, and/or an abnormal heartbeat.

, Use soap and water to wash the area of the tick bite. Apply some type of antiseptic to the area to disinfect the bite. You can use rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, etc. Make sure to wash your hands after you’ve completed this step., Testing is usually done by your local public health authority. Check with your heath department to see if testing is available in your area. The public health lab will start by checking what type of tick it is, as only some carry diseases. If the tick is of concern, they may then perform tests, or send it to a national lab for further tests.If you live in Canada in a province that does not have a provincial lab that tests ticks, you can submit the tick directly to the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) for testing. Follow the instructions on the Government of Canada website to submit a tick to the NML.
If you live in the United States, each state’s public health department will have a procedure on how to submit a tick for testing. Check your state’s public health website for detailed instructions.If you show signs of infection but are still waiting on the results of the tick test, do not relay treatment, and remember that false negatives are possible, or you may even have been bitten by another tick and not be aware.

Do not wear scented items.,
Use insect repellent.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Remove standing water.,
Light a citronella candle.,
Create an essential oil repellent.",How to Get Rid of Bug Bites3," Some bugs are attracted to certain scents, or just the fact that something smells different from what they’re use to. Avoid wearing any perfume or scented lotions and creams when outdoors., Insect repellent comes in both spray and lotion formats. Use insect repellent before going outdoors to help prevent bugs from landing on you in the first place. The spray is easier to cover your whole body, as it can also be sprayed directly onto your clothing. However, the lotion can be applied directly to your skin and can be targeted at exposed areas.Read the instructions for the repellent lotion as to whether you can use it on your face. Never apply it near your eyes.
Insect repellent that contains DEET is the most effective.
Wait at least 30 minutes before applying the repellent if you’ve just applied sunscreen.

, In addition to wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, you can also wear clothing specifically designed to keep the bugs out. This special clothing includes a hat with thin netting that comes down to cover your face, neck, and shoulders. If you’re going to an area with a lot of bugs, this might be a better option than repellent.You can also tuck your pants into your socks to keep the bugs from biting your ankles.

, Water that’s built up in puddles and ditches, or any water that isn’t moving with a current, can become breeding grounds for mosquito eggs. If there’s standing water on your property, remove it to help eliminate the possibility of mosquitoes. If you’re outdoors, avoid areas with standing water if you can., Candles made with citronella, linalool, and geraniol have all been shown to keep bugs, mainly mosquitoes, away. In fact, there are studies that show citronella reduces the number of female mosquitoes in the area by 35%, linalool reduces the number by 65%, and geraniol reduces the number by 82%!They even make citronella-scented badges that you can wear on your clothing.

, There are some essential oils that are known to help repel bugs, and when combined with water can be applied to your skin to help keep the bugs away. You can also try an essential oil diffuser instead of a candle.The following essential oils work to repel bugs: eucalyptus, clove, citronella, neem oil or cream, and camphor and menthol gels.
If you’re applying a solution directly to your skin, be careful to keep it away from your eyes.

Drain pasta and pour hot liquids away from you.,
Remove lids away from your body.,
Don’t drink or eat scalding hot foods.",How to Prevent Kitchen Burns2," When you drain cooked pasta or other hot liquids, you can potentially be burned from the steam or scalded by the boiling water. Make sure that the sink is empty except for the colander, and very slowly pour the pan away from your body. If anything splashes out, this will prevent hot water from touching you.It’s a good idea to wear tall oven mitts or arm protection when you’re pouring hot liquids, as they can prevent your arms from being scalded or burned.

, When you remove a lid from a pot or pan, use the handle and carefully lift the lid away from your body. This directs any steam away from you and prevents you from being scalded by hot steam.If the lid handle is also hot, use an oven mitt or hot pad so that you don’t burn your hand., You may tend to think of burns happening on your hands or skin, but forget that you can also scald your throat and the inside of your mouth. To avoid these painful, and sometimes dangerous, scalding burns, let your hot food or beverage sit for a few minutes to cool down before you ingest them. Also, if you see steam coming from your food or beverage, a good indication that they’re too hot to consume, you can blow on them to cool them down also."
"
Don’t touch hot surfaces.,
Remove foods from the microwave carefully.,
Keep your distance from hot oil.",How to Prevent Kitchen Burns3," While it may seem common sense not to touch a hot burner with your bare hand, you should always use caution when touching any surfaces that may be hot. You may forget that a pan is hot, or you may not know that someone recently turned a stove burner off and that it’s still hot. Treat all pans, pots, cookie sheets, and stove burners as hot until you verify that they aren’t.Put empty pans, pots, and baking sheets on empty burners while they cool down.
Wrap potholders around hot handles or set them on top of lids, but make sure that you’re not blocking any steam venting holes in the lid when you put the potholder on there.
If you need to use your stove but have a pot or pan that needs to cool down at the same time, put your pot or pan on a trivet on the counter. Just make sure that it’s out of the way so that you don’t accidentally bump into it.

, Take care when using the microwave, as microwaved food may be steaming, boiling, or have reached an internal temperature that will easily burn you. Remove microwave food lids carefully to avoid being scalded. Always assume that food cooked in the microwave is just as hot as food cooked by conventional methods.Put a plastic spoon in a cup or other smooth vessels when heating liquid in a microwave. A plastic spoon can prevent the liquid from spattering, preventing possible scalds.
Read the bottom of a container to make sure it is safe for the microwave oven before using the container to heat foods or liquids. Use only containers marked, ""Microwave Safe.""
Purchase microwave ovens that turn off automatically when you open the oven door.

, When air bubbles heat up enough, they pop, and if those bubbles are in oil, the oil can “pop” and send bits of hot oil shooting out of the pan. If you’re standing too close, the oil can jump on to your arm, hand, face, or clothes. To prevent yourself from being burned, stand a few feet away from a pan or pot that has hot oil in it. And use long tongs when you work with food in the hot oil.If oil or grease catches fire, slide a lid over the pan or pot. This will remove the air that the fire needs to keep burning and put the fire out quickly.
Under no circumstances should you ever put water on a grease or oil fire. This will only case the fire to flare up aggressively.

Childproof your outlets and appliances.,
Put appliances away.,
Don’t hold a child while you cook.,
Teach children to cook.,
Keep children secured.,
Prevent children from pulling hot items down on themselves.",How to Prevent Kitchen Burns4," You know to put safety caps on the exposed outlets around your home, and this is especially important in the kitchen. Whichever outlet cover you choose to use, make sure that you unplug appliances when they aren’t in use and cover the outlets. Kitchen outlets are a particular concern because of the proximity of metal objects, such as skewers, forks, keys, or knives, that a child could stick in a live outlet., While you don’t have to lock appliances up in a cabinet, you should unplug them when they’re not in use. This is especially important for any appliance that could heat up and burn your child or turn on and cut your child. Consider wrapping each appliance’s cord up so that it’s not only out of reach, but not easily plugged in should your child try to do so.Another safety tactic is to put a small lock through the cord’s prongs, which will prevent the plug from being inserted into an outlet.
It’s also important to put appliances out of a child’s reach, including cords, so that they can’t pull anything down on top of them.

, Even if your child is crying and something on the stove needs your immediate attention, such as a pot boiling over, do not hold your child while you cook. You have to choose which needs your attention more at that moment, your child or the pot on the stove. Unfortunately, when you lift the pot’s lid, steam might rush up and burn the child’s leg, or they might be kicking their feet and accidentally kick the pot or handle to a pan, flipping the hot contents all over both of you.Talk to your child and explain what you’re doing so that they understand that you’re not ignoring them.
You can also talk them through what you’re doing in the kitchen to satisfy their natural curiosity. Try gating the kitchen off so that they can watch you from a safe distance while you explain.

, From about the age of 18 months on, children’s natural curiosity and desire to help you naturally lend themselves to teaching your child to cook. They will gain skills in reasoning, dexterity, critical thinking, and counting, and, most importantly, kitchen safety. Teaching children to cook allows you to teach them how not to burn themselves while also teaching them important life skills.You know best what you should teach your child regarding burn prevention and kitchen safety.
Cooking together is a fun and educational way to bond with your child.
Toddlers are great at stirring and spooning ingredients.
Elementary school-aged children are great at cutting, folding, greasing, and mixing.
Older children (8-11) can help plan meals and also cook on the stove, with supervision, of course.
Allow only children who are tall enough to remove food from the microwave oven safely to use a microwave. Children who are too short to reach a microwave oven easily may risk facial burns.

, It’s best to keep children out of the kitchen and away from the oven and stove while you’re cooking, unless they’re helping you and you’re able to supervise them. Consider putting up baby gates that block the entrance to the kitchen or putting your little one in a high chair or playpen when you’re cooking.If you let your toddler in the kitchen with you, especially if they are just learning to walk or are holding on to objects to stand up, make sure to keep them away from the oven, as they might burn their hands on a hot oven door.

, Children are naturally curious, and may tug on tablecloths or towels that are hanging down within reach. This is especially true for children who are just learning to walk, as they tend to grab the first steady object to hold themselves up. Unfortunately, pulling a tablecloth or towel placed under hot cookware on a counter top or table can be dangerous because the cookware might come down on the child’s head. Position hot vessels away from counter top edges so children can't touch them or grab the handles. Turn pot and pan handles inward so they're not easily reached."

Avoid scratching.,
Treat the itch with an over the counter anti-itch cream or antihistamine pill.,
Apply a cold compress to bites.,
See a doctor if symptoms persist or worsen.",How to Prevent Chigger Bites2," Within 3 to 6 hours of a chigger biting you, the signs and symptoms will appear. The symptoms include red welts, itching, swelling, and fever. While the symptoms usually go away within 1 week, scratching the welts will prolong the length of time you will experience these symptoms. Avoid scratching the welts to ensure a quick recovery.


If you break the skin, your risk of contracting a secondary infection increases.

, Chigger bites are extremely itchy. To combat your desire to scratch, apply an over the counter anti-itch cream, such as menthol or calamine lotion. Antihistamine pills can also provide temporary itch relief.


When you apply anti-itch cream or take an antihistamine pill, always follow the product instructions., When applied directly to bites, cold compresses can provide temporary relief from itching. Wrap ice in a thin towel. Hold the compress against the affected area for 10 minutes at a time. Space out the use of the compress to prevent skin damage., Chigger bites typically do not require any medical attention.However, if your symptoms linger or worsen, call a doctor immediately. Contact a medical professional if you experience:


Shortness of breath
Fever
Dizziness, weakness, or fainting
Headache, chills, joint aches, and or vomiting
A new rash
Drainage from the bites or signs of infection"

Identify chigger hotspots.,
Maintain a well manicured yard.,
Treat your yard with insecticides.,
Call a pest controller.",How to Prevent Chigger Bites3," When the temperature rises above 60℉, female chiggers lay their eggs in clusters. Newly hatched chiggers do not stray far from each other, but remain congregated in damp, dark areas, such as high grass, brush piles, and shady areas. As a result, large numbers of chigger larvae may be present in one area, but not another. Instead of treating your entire property for chiggers, you may wish to spot treat. There are two methods of identifying chigger hot spots on your property:


Place pieces of black cardboard vertically in your yard. If mites are present in the area, they will climb to the top of the cardboard. Examine the cardboard for chigger larvae with a magnifying glass.
Retrieve a white sheet and a piece of dry ice. Spread out the sheet and set the dry ice in the center. The carbon dioxide from the dry ice will attract any nearby mites. Examine the dry ice for chigger larvae with a magnifying glass.
When you closely examine the cardboard or dry ice, your risk of getting chigger bites will increase. Also, these methods will attract all nearby mites, not just chiggers., In order to eliminate chiggers from your outdoor environment, you must eliminate their prefered habitats: dark, damp locations that offer them protection from the elements.


Mow your yard frequently to keep your grass short and free of weeds—chigger larvae hide in tall grassy areas.Prune your trees and bushes to reduce shade cover in your yard—chigger larvae cannot survive in direct sunlight.Remove briars, wood piles, and brush piles from your property., To reduce or eliminate the chigger population on your property, treat your yard with insecticides. You may either use natural or chemical products:


Diatomaceous earth, the fossilized remains of diatoms, is a natural chigger repellant.Spread bits and pieces of this sedimentary rock around your yard to ward off chiggers naturally.Treat your yard with carbaryl, an insecticide spray approved for use by non-licensed pest-controllers.

, When natural or commercial-grade insecticides fail to eliminate your chigger infestation, call a certified pest controller. Licensed pest controllers can use stronger chemicals, such as propoxur or cyfluthrin, to treat your lawn, trees, and shrubbery. If your chigger problem persists, request a second treatment within two to three weeks of the first application of insecticide.

Mix up a mild soap solution.,
Wet a washcloth with the soapy water.,
Wipe down the outside of the earbuds.,
Dry the earbuds thoroughly.",How to Clean Earbuds2," If your ear buds have a lot of grime caked on them, they'll likely need a deep cleaning. Fill a sink or basin with clean, lukewarm freshwater. Add a few drops of mild liquid detergent or hand soap. Don’t overdo it—you’ll only need a very small amount of soap. Stir the soap and water together until it forms a solution.The soap solution should only contain enough detergent to allow you to effectively clean your earbuds. In addition to the obvious risks to the electronic components of the earbuds, using too much soap can leave behind a slick residue.

, Take a clean washcloth and use it to soak up a little bit of the soap solution. Wring as much excess solution out of the washcloth as you can until it is just slightly damp. Cleaning electronic gadgets with with water can be tricky, and you don’t want to ruin your earbuds by getting them too wet.Make sure your hands are also mostly dry and clean before you start cleaning to prevent any accidental accidents.

, Use one corner of the washcloth to wipe down the earbuds. Pay particular attention to the contours on either side of the ear openings, where the buds rest in your ear canals. Stay away from the ear openings themselves as much as possible, as getting water into them can irreparably damage the earbuds.It may help to keep the input jack and cords covered with a towel while you work on the earbuds.
Hold the earbuds with the openings facing downward to prevent water and dislodged debris from running into them.
Wipe the earbuds lightly. Using too much force could force water out of the washcloth.

, Press the now clean earbuds into a clean, dry hand towel to absorb any moisture remaining on the outside. Then, take the earbuds to a drafty, well-ventilated space (somewhere near a fan or air conditioning unit usually works well) and leave them for at least an hour. Once the earbuds are completely dry, they’ll be ready for use.Just to be safe, consider letting the earbuds dry overnight.
Never attempt to dry your earbuds or any other electronics using a heat source such as a hair dryer. Headphones are made up of plastic, thin metal wires and other materials that can easily be melted or destroyed by direct application of heat.

Buy a bottle of rubbing alcohol.,
Dip a cotton swab into the alcohol.,
Clean around the earbuds.,
Pat the earbuds with a clean towel.",How to Clean Earbuds3," Take a quick trip down to your local supermarket or pharmacy and pick up a bottle of rubbing alcohol, also known as isopropyl alcohol. Only buy alcohol that is pure and unscented; you never know how foreign chemicals will react with the materials your earbuds are made from. Rubbing alcohol is a cheap, effective way to gently clean and disinfect without making a mess or damaging your belongings.You can purchase a bottle of rubbing alcohol for just a couple dollars or pounds and it will last you for many, many cleanings (of your earbuds or other objects).
Isopropyl alcohol has antibacterial properties, making it ideal for sanitizing objects that have been inserted into the ears or other orifices where germs may congregate., Place one end of a cotton swab into the alcohol and let it absorb. Tap or press the cotton swab against the side of the bottle to remove any extra alcohol saturating the tip. You only need a light coating of alcohol to clean something as small and delicate as a pair of earbuds. The tip of the cotton swab should be almost dry.Wet the cotton swab with more alcohol as needed, but don’t use too much. It’s not a good idea to directly expose your electronics to moisture of any kind.
You might also think about using an alcohol swab if you happen to have one on hand, although even these can be oversaturated and may need to be wrung out beforehand. It’s preferable to use a cotton swab because you can control exactly how much liquid goes on it.

, Wipe the outer plastic area of the earbuds with the alcohol-dipped cotton swab. The isopropyl alcohol will break down grime that has dried and stuck on, as well as clear away traces of oil and perspiration left behind by your skin. Once again, clean the ear openings very carefully, or avoid them altogether if there is no visible debris built up inside.Use one end of the cotton swab for each earbud to ensure that you’re cleaning with a fresh surface.

, Give the earbuds a pat down with a clean, dry towel. The rest of the alcohol should quickly evaporate and dry on its own. Your earbuds should now be sparkling clean and rid of bacteria and inner ear gunk. Best of all, wiping your earbuds down with alcohol is safe and easy enough to be repeated as often as needed. Happy listening!


This is the method that most professional technicians recommend for cleaning heavily-used earbuds."

Recognize the symptoms of a bug bite.,
Know when it is an emergency.,
Know when to follow up with a doctor.",How to Get Rid of Bug Bites4," While this may seem quite obvious, it is important to be sure you’re treating a bug bite and not something else, like poison ivy. Plus, some symptoms may be similar to other medical conditions, especially if you are allergic to the bug that bit you.The following symptoms are usually found on or near the area of the actual bite: pain, swelling, redness, itching, warmth, hives, and/or small amounts of bleeding. You can experience one, some, all, or even none of these symptoms, depending on how you personally react to the specific bug and bite.The following symptoms are more serious and could indicate there is a life-threatening allergy to the bug bite: coughing, tickling in the throat, tightness in the throat or chest, breathing problems, wheezing, nausea or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, sweating, anxiety, and/or itching and a rash somewhere else on your body other than the bite area., If someone was stung inside the mouth, nose or throat, or is experiencing a possible severe allergic reaction, call 911 or 999 or take the person to the ER right away. People who are suffering in this way may need medical intervention to help them breathe, and will likely need some sort of medication in order to alleviate the symptoms (e.g. epinephrine, corticosteroids, etc.).If the person who was stung has a known allergy to certain bug bites, she may carry an EpiPen (a portable shot which delivers epinephrine) with her. If she has one, follow the instructions on the EpiPen to administer the medication to the person immediately. Instructions on how to use an EpiPen can also be found on their website here.
The person must still see a doctor immediately, even if you have administered a shot of epinephrine.

, If the person who was stung is not having a serious allergic reaction (or wasn’t stung inside his airway) he may be okay temporarily. If he starts to experience any of the following symptoms, he may need to go to the doctor for further treatment.Secondary infections can be caused by itching and causing a break in the skin through which bacteria can enter. The skin is the first layer of defense against infection.
Persistent pain or itching, fever, signs of infection at the bug bite location.
As an example, if this person has an infection, he will most likely need antibiotics in order to fight that infection.

Take showers once or twice a day, where possible.,
Wash your hair every other day.,
Wear clean clothes.,
Add lotion.,
Use perfume or cologne if you like it.,
Brush your teeth regularly.,
Wash your face twice a day.",How to Keep Good Hygiene," Taking a shower every day helps get rid of dead skin, excessive grime and odors. Gently clean private areas with a special soaps that don't cause irritation.;
, Washing your hair helps to get rid of excessive oils, and will make your hair feel soft and bouncy. Washing your hair too often may cause your scalp to dry, produce more oils and cause dandruff. If your hair is thick and curly, it may be best to wash your hair once or twice a week. Brush your hair each day, but don't over-brush it, so as to avoid breakage.

, Clean clothes include underwear and underclothes, as well as t-shirts, pants, etc. Wearing dirty underclothes can cause irritation, which can lead to infections. If clothes have stains, rips, and odors, then either replace or fix them. Clean clothes help you to smell good and are healthy for you.

, After taking a shower (or bath), make sure to put lotion on your skin. Lotion helps to replenish lost body oil after taking a shower. It also moisturizes your skin. Finish up with deodorant if you're heading out for work, study, sport or leisure activities.

, Perfume and cologne add a splash of fresh fragrance to your skin. Do not add too much, as it can easily go from a subtle and enjoyable scent to one that is overpowering. Two brief sprays of perfume/cologne should be good enough.

, Make sure you brush, floss, and use mouthwash at least twice a day. Not only does it give you better breath, but your teeth will look whiter and cleaner. They'll also be stronger for regular brushing.

, This freshens and helps to prevent and heal acne or skin-related issues. Use a face wash or soap made for acne prone skin, if needed. If you have small facial scars, using a fade cream to even out your skin, if you feel the need.

Avoid eating inadequately cooked fish and other seafood.,
Know which dishes require vigilance.,
Clean and eviscerate fish as soon as possible after catching them.,
Adequately freeze fish to cure it for a given time to consume raw, using one of the following processes to kill all of the infectious larvae:



One full week: Freeze at -20°C (-4°F) or below for at least 7 days; or

Partial day: Freeze at -35°C (-31°F) or below until solid, then store at -35°C (-31°F) or below for 15 hours; or

One full day: Freeze at -35°C (-31°F) or below until solid and then store at -20°C (-4°F) or below for 24 hours.

,
Cook all fish and seafood thoroughly at or above 63°C (145°F).",How to Prevent Anisakiasis from Parasites in Fish," Anisakiasis results from ingestion of uncooked or inadequately cooked and inadequately prepared fish and other seafood--including inadequate: ""cold-cure"", ""smoke-cure"", or ""acidic-cure"". When in doubt about the safety of the fish in a restaurant or public or private place, do not consume it.;
, Here are some of the most commonly contaminated dishes to beware of:



Sushi and sashimi, containing slices of raw fish
Lightly pickled herring


Ceviche and lomi lomi, containing raw fish marinated in lemon juice with other ingredients
Wild or farmed salmon eggs
Anchovies in vinegar

Uncooked sardines with vinegar and miso

Cold smoked fish.

, Doing this will reduce the number of larvae penetrating from the fresh fish's intestines into the muscles. All intestines must be completely removed and not ingested.

,, The flesh should be firm and well-cooked.

Wash your hands regularly.If you are caring for someone with the flu and want to avoid catching it yourself, one of the key things to do is to wash your hands regularly.,
Clean and disinfect any frequently touched surfaces.If you are living with and caring for someone with the flu, it is important to clean and disinfect commonly touched areas such as doorknobs, countertops, and kitchen appliances regularly.,
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue.The number one way in which the flu virus is spread is through respiratory droplets, which can be passed from one person to another if someone coughs or sneezes within 6 feet of you, or even if they talk while close to you.",How to Care for Flu Patients Without Getting Sick1," This helps to prevent any germs you may have picked up on your hands (from touching contaminated surfaces) from infecting you.


Wash your hands with warm water and soap for 30 seconds before eating, and after touching surfaces that may have been shared with the sick person (and that may therefore be contaminated with germs).
If it is challenging for you to wash your hands with soap and water, another option is to carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you. For instance, if you work in a healthcare facility, this may be your most convenient option as you will be around sick people all day every day.;
, If the infected person is in a care facility and you work there, the cleaning will be taken care of by janitors and other staff.


Common disinfectants include a bleach-water solution (add 1/2 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water), detergents, Lysol, or alcohol-based cleaning solutions., It is for this reason that it is important to ask the sick person to cover all coughs and sneezes with a tissue, so that the droplets do not spread as far in the air. Also, using a tissue is better than the person using their hand; if they use that hand the germs can then be passed onto any surfaces touched thereafter.

"
"
Stay in separate areas of the house whenever possible.Because your likelihood of catching the flu virus increases in direct proportion to your proximity to an infected person (as well as to the amount of time spent with the infected person), you will want to stay separate as much as possible.,
Use separate linens, dishes, and eating utensils.It may sound obvious, but because the flu virus can be transmitted from germs on surfaces, and also from droplets, you will want to avoid sharing linens, dishes, and eating utensils with the infected person.

,
Have the infected person stay home from work, so as not to infect others.In addition to the fact that you are trying to protect yourself from catching the flu virus, you also don't want others in the community catching the illness if it can be avoided.,
Ensure the sick person is getting what they need to recover.",How to Care for Flu Patients Without Getting Sick2," If your intimate partner is ill, sleeping in separate bedrooms (if you have a guest room) is ideal until the person recovers. If this is not possible, avoid cuddling and kissing and stay on your separate sides of the bed until the virus subsides.


If you have two or more bathrooms in your home, use separate bathrooms (and separate towels) until the person recovers. This will help to prevent the spread of germs, and will minimize your risk of catching the flu.
Select a chair for the infected person in the living room, so that you can avoid sitting in a chair that is contaminated with infectious germs.

,, For this reason, if the ill person can afford time off work (if they are granted sick days from their boss), now would be the time to take them. The infected person's co-workers will be grateful to not be exposed to infectious germs.


Another option, depending upon the type of work that the person does, is to work from home until the virus subsides. This way, others are not at risk of catching the infection.

, Offer them plenty of fluids, encourage lots of rest, and offer tissues and hand sanitizer to the infected person as needed. You can also help out by cooking meals for him or her, and looking after household duties until the affected person recovers.

Understand that the easiest way for the flu virus to be transmitted is via respiratory droplets.If a person coughs or sneezes near you, if they talk within close proximity to you, or if an intimate partner kisses you, you will be at high risk of catching the virus.,
Know that the flu can also be transmitted via contaminated objects and surfaces.A less common (but still possible) way for the flu to be transmitted is by touching something after an infected person has touched it, and picking up the germs that way.,
Be aware that you can catch the flu even before the infected person shows symptoms.Many people do not realize that they are contagious one day before the onset of symptoms.",How to Care for Flu Patients Without Getting Sick3," This is why it is important to keep space between you and an infected person, and to have them cover all coughs and sneezes with a tissue to prevent germ transmission.

, The virus can live on surfaces for up to 24 hours. This is why cleaning and disinfecting shared surfaces is so important, as well as having separate linens, towels, and eating utensils.

, Before they even realize they are sick with the flu, they could be inadvertently passing the infection onto others.


The flu virus is contagious one day before the onset of symptoms, and up to seven days following the onset of symptoms.
This is one of the many reasons why it is always important to wash your hands thoroughly — not just when someone is sick or during flu season, but always.
Getting enough sleep every night, staying hydrated, and eating healthy are all ways to keep your body and immune system healthy so you will be less likely to catch the flu from someone.

Wash your hands.,
Don't touch your eyes, nose and mouth before washing.,
Don't share food and drinks with others.,
Avoid sharing personal items.,
Try to stay away from people who are sick.,
Get a flu shot.",How to Keep from Getting Sick1," This is the single most effective way to keep yourself from getting the cold or flu and make sure you don't spread it to anyone else.The cold virus is easily spread through touch, so washing your hands is the best way to get rid of it when you pick it up. It's especially important to wash your hands after being in a public space where lots of people who might have the cold and flu have touched what you touched. Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap after you:


Ride the subway, bus, or train
Go to the grocery store or any other highly-trafficked store
Go to school or work
Go to a public restroom
Use gym equipment;
, Touching banisters and elevator buttons is unavoidable, but you can avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Touching these parts of your face makes it easy for the cold or flu to get into your system. Don't rub your eyes, wipe your nose or lick your fingers before you get a chance to wash your hands with warm water and soap.


Antibacterial gel and wipes are handy to have around for when there's not a facility nearby to wash your hands.
If you must wipe your nose or touch your face, cover your hand with a tissue - or worst case, a sleeve - to avoid transmitting germs directly from your fingers to your face.

, During cold and flu season, it's best to turn down offers to share food and drinks. Coming into contact with someone else's saliva or mucous is a sure way to catch whatever virus they might be incubating. Use your own utensils and get your own cup instead of sharing with someone else.

, Maybe it's obvious that you shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush, but there are other personal items you should also avoid sharing. Don't use someone's razor, nail clippers and other items that come into contact with their bodily fluids. The same goes for sharing towels, washcloths, and even bedding items, like sheets and pillow cases. These items can all pass along someone else's cold or flu germs.


Don't share people's makeup, either. Using someone else's lipstick, eyeliner, mascara, and foundation could transfer their germs to your face.
Avoid using someone else's cell phone, and sanitize your own frequently.

, If you think that someone may be ill, it's a good idea to keep a safe distance while you're interacting with that person..


You could also consider wearing a face mask when you go out to filter out bacteria and viruses.

, When everyone around you is sick, you're going to need to take extra care to avoid getting ill. One smart preventative measure is to get a flu shot, which many people find keeps them well until flu season passes. See your doctor to get a flu shot, or visit a local pharmacy to get one at a discount.


Different flu shots are approved for different groups of people. Some are meant to be administered only to people 18 years or older, while others are designed for children or babies. Be sure to go to a professional clinic to get the right type of shot.If you are considered ""high risk,"" you should definitely get a flu shot. The ""high risk"" category includes the following groups: people over 65 or under 5, pregnant women, and people with certain medical conditions."

Wash your hands.,
Don’t touch the inside of your nose or mouth.Since CMV is absorbed through the mucous membranes, keeping your hands out of the nose and mouth is a crucial step in preventing infection.,
Avoid contact with blood.,
Be extra careful if your immune system is compromised.Individuals with HIV/AIDS or another autoimmune deficiency should take extra steps to avoid contracting CMV.",How to Prevent Cytomegalovirus (CMV)1," Washing your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water for 15-20 seconds can help prevent CMV, especially after changing diapers or touching saliva, urine, or nasal secretions from a young child.To wash your hands properly, use soap and lather for at least 10 seconds. Be sure to scrub the backs of your hands as well as your palms. Get under the fingernails and between the fingers.


Encourage your children to practice hand washing, too. Instruct them in the proper method.;
, Instead of picking a bit of stray food out of your teeth, for instance, use a toothpick or swish some water around in your mouth.


Use a tissue to blow your nose. Wash your hands afterward.
Always wash your hands before flossing.

, Blood transfusions and transplanted organs can lead to CMV infection.While there is sometimes no alternative, consult your doctor to help you find potential alternatives to blood transfusions and organ transplants if you are concerned about CMV.


Using and sharing dirty needles could also cause a CMV infection. If you are addicted to intravenous drugs (or any other kind of drugs), seek help from a qualified substance abuse counselor.
If cleaning up a surface that has blood on it, wear disposable gloves.Cover the blood drops with paper towel and allow them to soak the blood. Pour a 10% bleach solution around the edges of the blood. Continue pouring the solution toward the center of the blood, then dispose of the paper towel. Wipe up any remaining blood, then spray the area once more with bleach and wipe it away with paper towels. Place all the paper towels and disposable gloves you used in the trash.
Sterilize items that have come in contact with blood in rubbing alcohol or boiling water.

, For instance, avoid cutting yourself, and apply first aid immediately if you do. Continue to take medication as prescribed and to follow any other instructions from your doctor. If you develop any CMV symptoms (see below), seek immediate medical attention.

Maintain excellent hygiene and avoid contact with recently used bedding or other materials which may contain bodily fluids."

Learn about shy bladder syndrome.,
Rehearse success.,
Use relaxation techniques.,
Seek help.,
Know the etiquette.",How to Pee in a Locker Room1," If your fear of public restrooms makes it difficult to leave the house, you might actually have a medical condition known as paruresis. Commonly known as a ""shy"" or ""bashful"" bladder, this problem is classified as a general anxiety order. If fear keeps you from being able to comfortably urinate in a locker room, ask your doctor about paruresis.In addition to anxiety, there can also be physical symptoms of shy bladder such as persistent pain and pressure in the bladder. If this sounds familiar, make sure to consult your doctor. You'll want to get professional advice in treating your condition.;
, The old saying ""practice makes perfect"" can actually help you urinate more comfortable. When you are relieving yourself at home, note your ease and comfort level. Then, imagine you are in a public restroom, feeling equally relaxed. By rehearsing, you can help overcome your anxiety by training your brain to feel more relaxed., You can also try using some common tricks to ease your anxiety. For example, when you are preparing to pee, take several deep, calming breaths. You can also use mental imaging. Try imagining yourself somewhere else--either a stop where you know you'd be relaxed or somewhere you would feel more comfortable urinating., If this problem is interfering with your daily life, it is time to talk to a medical professional. One option is to talk to your regular doctor about trying medication. There are many options for different types of social anxiety. Alternatively, you could see a mental health specialist. Ask about cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorders. If you decide to try therapy, make sure you are working with a professional who makes you feel comfortable. It can be useful to ask your primary doctor, or a close friend, to refer someone they trust.

, Maybe you do not have paruresis. Maybe you just have an aversion to locker rooms. In that case, you can make sure you are aware of proper locker room etiquette to try to make yourself more comfortable. For example, do not try to start in-depth conversations at the urinal. Also, do not urinate in the shower. For the most part, just use your manners.

Eat plenty of vitamin-rich foods.,
Stay hydrated.,
Get rest.,
Try to reduce the amount of stress you're under.,
Cut back on drinking and smoking.,
Make exercise a priority.,
Harness the power of steam.,
Use immune-boosting herbs.",How to Keep from Getting Sick2," No matter what type of illness you're trying not to catch, you can give yourself the best chance of staying healthy by having a diet rich in essential vitamins and minerals. People who are malnourished experience higher rates of disease and illness.Make sure your diet includes the following components, all of which have been linked to immune system health, to keep your immune system strong:



Vitamin A. Eat carrots, sweet potatoes, leafy greens, squash, apricots and melons.Vitamin B. Eat beans, vegetables, poultry, fish, and meat.

Vitamin C. Eat papaya, broccoli, bell peppers, oranges, kiwi, strawberries and brussels sprouts.Vitamin D. Get plenty of sun and eat salmon, herring and soy.Vitamin E. Eat almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, and peanut butter.Selenium. Eat tuna, shrimp, salmon, turkey, chicken, and other fish.Zinc. Eat seafood, beef, wheat germ, spinach and cashews., Drinking enough water - and getting water through fruits and vegetables - is essential to keeping your immune system strong and helping your body expel germs. Drink 8 cups a day to keep yourself in good health, and step it up when you feel an illness coming on. Make sure you stay hydrated from morning til night., You've probably experienced this scenario: you pulled two all-nighters in a row, and on the third day you came down with a cold. Sleep deprivation makes the body less able to combat illness, and more susceptible to getting sick in the first place.Aim to get at least 7 - 8 hours every night.

, Related to the issue of sleep is the amount of stress in your life. Social or psychological stress can take a toll on the body's immune response, too. Stress can disrupt the body's communication between the nervous system, endocrine (hormonal) system, and immune system. Basically, stress keeps them from choreographing a delicate balance that allows you to stay healthy. Scientists believe that stress sends out a steady trickle of hormones that affect the function of your body's white blood cells, which are the immune response's fighters., Drinking alcohol and smoking lead to a host of health problems, and they exacerbate common illnesses as well. If you're feeling a little under the weather, pass on going out for drinks or smoking cigarettes. Drink water, eat a good meal, and go to bed early instead, and you just might be able to avoid getting sick.

, Daily exercise is best, but if you can't commit to a daily routine, try to include exercise in your regimen at least three times per week. Working out keeps your oxygen supply going, detoxifies your body, and simply strengthens your body inside and out.

, Add moisture to the air through technology (vaporizer, humidifier) or the old-fashioned way (pots of hot water). When the air around you gets very dry, your body's mucus membranes tend to dry out. Although mucus may seem nasty and useless, it's incredibly important: it contains lots of helpful antibodies that are designed to prevent illness, and it doubles as a sort of flypaper that traps would-be intruders (bacteria) before they have time to fully get into your system.Get just the right amount of humidity in the air. Try to keep the humidity between 30% and 50% in the summer, and between 30% and 40% in the winter.Dip below 30% humidity and the mucus gets too dry; go above 50% and you're prone to giving yourself a different set of health problems.

, While most herbs haven't been proven to prevent sickness, there are a few that seem to help. There's no harm in drinking herbal tea and incorporating herbs into your diet in order to give yourself the best chance to avoid sickness. Try the following healthy herbs:


Garlic has been shown to help prevent infection.
Ginseng is said to boost immune function.Probiotics help with digestion and to prevent infection.
Echinacea is commonly used as a preventative measure against colds, but its efficacy is controversial in the medical community."
"
Get appropriate vaccinations.,
Take precautions when traveling.,
Practice safe sex.",How to Keep from Getting Sick3," Many sicknesses can be prevented by vaccines administered during childhood or later in life. If you aren't vaccinated against common illnesses, or you aren't sure whether your vaccinations are up to date, talk with your doctor about getting vaccines. Chicken pox, for example, has been all but wiped out thanks to vaccinations. The same goes for measles, polio and other once-common illnesses., If you're planning to travel to another country, look into whether you should take precautions to keep from getting sick. You won't be used to the food and water there, and you'll be exposed to new pathogens. Take the following precautions:


Visit a doctor to get vaccines and preventative medication if you're going to a place where malaria, tuberculosis, and other illnesses are easy to contract.
Find out what food and water is safe to eat and drink in the region where you're traveling. You might want to bring your own provisions to be on the safe side.
Bring a mosquito net if you're going to a place where malaria is commonly spread.

, Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) aren't difficult to prevent if you take precautions. Be sure to use a condom or another barrier that prevents the transmission of STIs during sex. If you have a long-term partner, you and your partner should both get tested for common STIs.

"

Do not share utensils, cups, or plates.,
Practice safe sex.People who have been infected with CMV can pass it on to their sexual partners.",How to Prevent Cytomegalovirus (CMV)2," It’s pleasant to dine with your friends and family, but when you do, always use your own cup, utensils, and dishes. Otherwise, you could accidentally expose yourself to CMV-infected saliva.


If someone offers you a sip of their drink, politely decline. Say, for instance, “Thanks, but I’m not thirsty.”
Use care when throwing out paper, plastic, or other disposable plates, cups, and utensils. Wash your hands after handling these items.

, Use a condom during sex in order to limit the chance of getting a CMV infection. Do not have sex with people whose sexual history you do not know.


Since bodily fluids contain the CMV virus, use protection during oral sex as well.

Monitor your energy levels.,
See a doctor.",How to Prevent Cytomegalovirus (CMV)3," Use a thermometer to diagnose whether someone has a fever. For adults, any body temperature above 100.4ºF (38ºC) is considered a fever.


The normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Your particular body temperature might be a bit higher or lower than this. Use an abnormal temperature and related symptoms to determine if you have a fever.
Other symptoms of fever include sweating, shivering, headaches, and dehydration.
Temperatures between 103 and 106 degrees Fahrenheit might result in confusion, irritability, or hallucinations.

, Swollen glands and a sore throat could indicate you’ve contracted CMV.If your throat hurts constantly, feels scratchy or raspy, or your neck feels swollen, monitor your condition.


Use an over-the-counter throat medicine to relieve swelling and pain in your throat.

, Individuals with CMV often suffer from extreme fatigue.You may feel listless and constantly tired. Get at least eight hours of sleep each night in order to reduce feelings of fatigue.

, Since the symptoms of CMV could be due to many illnesses, it is important to confirm or rule out the existence of CMV with a blood test.If symptoms consistent with CMV persist, talk to your doctor about your condition. He or she may recommend that you get a test to look for CMV and prescribe a treatment plan.


Individuals with compromised immune systems might exhibit additional symptoms, including diarrhea, hepatitis, shortness of breath, and pneumonia.
Infants with congenital CMV might also exhibit unique symptoms, such as jaundice, seizures, a rash of purple spots across the skin, and a low birth weight.A laboratory test can detect the virus in a person's body fluids (blood or urine) or by a tissue biopsy.

Get some space.,
Become an advocate.",How to Pee in a Locker Room2," Perhaps using the locker room is unavoidable, but you might be able to make your visits more bearable. For example, if you have issues using the locker room at your gym, try changing up your workout schedule. Go extra early in the morning or later at night to avoid the prime time crowds. The less people in the locker room, the more likely it is that you'll feel comfortable urinating.

, Don't be afraid to use the stalls anytime you're in a locker room. While it's not the same as being in your own home, those cubicles can add an important layer of privacy. You'll also have more privacy in there to use the relaxation techniques you've been practicing.

, Maybe the locker room is necessary for a shower and a change of clothes, but that doesn't mean that you have to take care of all of your business in there. Chances are, there is an alternate bathroom somewhere on site. Take time to scope out the building. Is there a ""hidden"" restroom? Maybe it's tucked away on a floor that doesn't see much foot traffic. Don't be afraid to head their to relieve yourself., If you're a man, sometimes the only available option is a urinal. While this can be less than ideal if you suffer from paruresis, you can still make it work. Position yourself at the end of the urinal. Make sure to put as much physical space between yourself and other users. If the urinals are crowded, wait 30 seconds to a minute, if you can. Others will appreciate that you respect their space., With the increasing number of transgender individuals, bathrooms have actually become an important political topic. There are movements to make sure that more buildings have private, comfortable restrooms. That could mean no more long lines of uncomfortable urinals! Become an advocate for more privacy, and use your voice. For example, write to your Congressman. Or to management at your gym. They might just solve the problem for you! "

If your morning routine has not been working out for you, make a plan to change the way you wake up and start your day.;
, Sleep deprivation can cause a wide range of health problems, so it’s important to make sure that you are getting enough sleep every night. Your sleep needs are based on your age as well as other factors. For example, adults need between 7-8 hours of sleep per night, but if you have been sleep deprived for a while, you may require more until your body recovers., You might instinctively stretch in the morning, but if not it’s a good habit to incorporate.

Disinfect your hands frequently.,
Don't touch other patients.,
Don't touch medical equipment or machines.,
Keep your hands away from your eyes and mouth.,
Try to eat nutritiously and drink lots of purified water.,
Ask for daily bathing with antiseptic agents.,
Ask all staff to sanitize their hands before touching you.,
Notify the staff of any spills, especially body fluids.,
Make sure the hospital staff practices the aseptic technique.",How to Prevent Health Care Associated Infections," One of the most important steps to take for reducing the risk of getting an infection while staying in a hospital or clinical setting is washing your hands properly — at least with soap and water, but preferably also with alcohol-based gels or wipes.Washing your hands is not only important after going to the bathroom, but also, after you touch any other surface or person outside the bathroom. Surfaces to be particularly careful of are doorknobs, light switches, bedside railings, curtains, bedside tables and medical equipment and paraphernalia.


Consider using the paper towel you used to dry your hands with in the bathroom as a barrier over doorknobs and bedside rails. Once you're back in bed, throw the paper towel in a nearby garbage bin.
Make sure there is a dispenser of alcohol-based hand sanitizer within reach of your bed. Once you return to bed from the bathroom, sanitize your hands again.;
, Touching other patients, even for compassionate reasons, isn't a good idea in hospitals or other long-term care facilities. They may be harboring antibiotic-resistant bacteria or super pathogenic viruses on their skin or clothing that can infect you and make you very ill. Conversely, you may transfer similar pathogenic microorganisms to them and put their lives at stake. Talking and listening to other patients is fine and often passes the time faster, but never contact other patient's wounds or bandages and don't shake their hands. Also, avoid sharing towels, washcloths, razors or clothes


If you or any surrounding patients are coughing repeatedly, then consider wearing a surgical mask when in close proximity. Viruses and bacteria travel and become airborne within droplets of saliva and mucus.
Common HAIs include Clostridium difficile (C. diff), MRSA, Acinetobacter, Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), hepatitis, Klebsiella norovirus, and more.MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria because they are resistant to several common antibiotics.MRSA bacteria developed in hospitals decades ago due to overuse of antibiotics. Now, there are only a few powerful drugs that can contain MRSA bacteria.

, It should go without saying that you shouldn't touch medical equipment because you may disrupt the function or change the settings (which can put your life at risk), but medical devices and paraphernalia are also commonly contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. In fact, some of the most deadly vectors of infection can survive for weeks on medical equipment and in patient rooms.As such, keep your hands to yourself and your curiosity in check by not touching any medical devices, intravenous paraphernalia or nearby diagnostic equipment.


Each year more than 18,000 American patients die from MRSA infections that they contract while in hospitals.In addition to bacteria, serious viruses to be concerned about in a hospital setting include MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)., Even if you're diligent about washing and sanitizing your hands while in the hospital, it's a good idea to break the habit of touching your face, particularly your mouth and eyes. Bacteria and viruses on your hands are unlikely to lead to infections there (unless you have cuts or abrasions), but your eyes and mouth are entry points into your body where pathogenic microorganisms can take advantage and multiply if the conditions are right. If they can penetrate the mucous membranes of the eyes and mouth, they can also gain access to the bloodstream and infect other parts of the body.


If you don't already wear glasses, consider wearing clear plastic eye protection to prevent yourself from touching or rubbing your eyes.
Women need to take special precaution against transmitting germs while applying their eye makeup and lipstick. Within a hospital setting, it's safer to go without makeup.When using alcohol-based hand rubs and sanitizers, products with at least 60% alcohol content are preferred., Always remember that your immune system is designed to fight off pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses, so that is ultimately your best ally in preventing hospital infections. The main problem is that most people who enter a hospital or clinic are sick and have compromised or weakened immunity, which makes them particularly susceptible to infections. As such, make sure to eat lots of fresh produce and keep well hydrated. Fruits and veggies are loaded with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other compounds that can kill bacteria and viruses.Drinking lots of water keeps your blood volume up and mucous membranes moist, making it difficult for pathogens to penetrate inside your body.


Preparing fresh fruit smoothies before you head into the hospital for a procedure is a good idea, or have your family bring them to you on a regular basis. Snacking on raw veggies (broccoli, tomatoes, cucumbers) is another great way of getting important nutrients into your body.
Your immune system will benefit by avoiding refined sugars while in the hospital (soda pop, candy, ice cream, desserts, most baked goods).
Supplements that can boost immunity include vitamins A, C and D, zinc, selenium, echinacea, olive leaf extract and astragalus root.Remember not to take supplements of any kind without consulting a doctor first. They may interact with medications or medical conditions.

, Research suggests that bathing hospital patients daily with a mild antibacterial soap can reduce skin and bloodstream infections dramatically.Hospital nurses and support staff are typically very busy and probably don't enjoy constantly cleaning ill patients, but ask or remind them politely to help you with such tasks on a daily basis. This is particularly important if you're unable to get to the bathroom to urinate or defecate. Changing adult diapers is not enough by itself — it should be followed by daily baths.


The antiseptic soap of choice is chlorhexidine gluconate, and it comes in several forms, including bars and wipes. It's available over the counter, so consider buying a few bars if you anticipate a longer hospital stay.
Some medical experts believe it's helpful for surgery patients to shower with chlorhexidine soap both the night before and morning of their surgery., Don't make the assumption that all hospital staff are equally trained or conscientious about preventing the spread of infections — they aren't. Take it upon yourself to politely remind or ask all staff who approach you to sanitize their hands in front of you at your bedside.Some health care professionals might take mild offense to such as request, but be polite and remind them it's for everybody's safety. Hospital staff get busy and touch lots of people and equipment in a short period of time, so they're usually not being lazy or irresponsible, just harried and stressed.


Hospitals that place dispensers of alcohol-based hand sanitizer at more locations (patient rooms, hallways, nursing stations, near elevators) see dramatic increases in the staff's compliance with basic hand hygiene — often from less than 50% compliance to 80% or more.Hospital staff often wear latex surgical gloves to protect themselves from patients, but sometimes forget that the gloves need to be changed on a very regular basis in order to ensure the patient's safety. It's not rude to request that a staff member change his gloves in from of you, but always be courteous.
If you feel self-conscious about it, you can keep it light and say something like — ""I'm a little paranoid about germs. It would make me feel a lot better if I could see you change your gloves.""

, If you notice any spills in your hospital room (or anywhere else in the hospital), notify the staff of it so they can properly clean it up. This is particularly important with body wastes (feces, urine) and other fluids (blood, vomit, saliva, mucus) because they tend to harbor various microorganisms that can lead to infections.However, spilled food and drink can also provide a breading ground for bacteria and mold. The hospital staff should have strict protocols in how to deal with spills, and not just use a standard mop and bucket.


Remember that patients and visitors should never clean up a spill in a hospital, even if you're just trying to help out and be nice. Let the professionals do their job and keep yourself safe.
Body fluid/waste spills are much more common in intensive care, emergency and geriatric wards of a hospital, so be extra cautious if you are in such areas.

, Observe if the procedures performed by the hospital staff are done using the ""aseptic technique."" The aseptic technique simply means that procedures and materials used on you are always clean and sterile.For example, any diagnostic instrument used on you should be either new, freshly sanitized or covered with a clean wrap, cover, tip, etc. Instruments or tools should not be used on you directly after another patient without some form of sanitation. The use of fresh gloves, masks, paper on examining tables and so on is also part of the aseptic technique.


If you have an intravenous catheter in your arm, try to keep the skin around the dressing clean and dry. Tell the nurse immediately if the dressing works loose or gets wet, as that's a breach of the aseptic technique protocol.
Ideally, hospital staff shouldn't wear rings, watches and jewelry around patients because they are difficult to sanitize. Feel free to ask them to remove such items while attending to you.

Improve your bedtime habits.,
Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.,
Wake up gently.,
Set a positive tone for your day.",How to Start a Day in a Healthy Way2," Getting a good’s night sleep is not always easy, but you can make it better by working to improve your bedtime habits. Consider your usual evening routine and think about what might be preventing you from getting a good night’s sleep. Do you drink caffeinated beverages late in the day? Do you have hard time relaxing at night? Use the following suggestions to help you improve your bedtime habits.


Make your bedroom a pleasing, relaxing space. If your bedroom is messy or cluttered, you might have a hard time relaxing at night. Make sure that it is clean and attractive so that you don’t have anything distracting you from getting a good night’s sleep.
Don’t have any alcohol, caffeine, or nicotine at least three hours before bed. Alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine can disrupt your sleep cycle, so it’s best to avoid these substances in the hours leading up to your bedtime.
Do something to relax before bed. Reading in bed for 10-15 minutes, meditating, or talking to your partner are good ways to calm down and get ready to sleep. Avoid watching television or playing video games right before bed because they may cause you to become more alert., Having a consistent sleeping and waking times are essential to starting your day in a healthy way. If your bedtimes and wake up times are erratic, try to correct the problem by setting a regular bedtime and wake-up time that you can stick to. Also, make sure that you will give yourself enough time to get your recommended amount of sleep every night. For example, if you need to be at work by 8am every morning, you may need to wake up by 6:30 to have enough time to get ready and get to work on time. Therefore, you should go to bed no later than 10:30pm every night to get the right amount of sleep.Try a sleep monitor or tracker to make sure you are getting enough sleep every night., A jarring alarm clock may be getting your day off to a stressful start. If your alarm clock stresses you out, try using an alarm clock that wakes you up with a progressive sound or that uses light instead of sound to wake you up. There are even some apps for smartphones that can help you to wake up gently rather than with a loud, jarring alarm sound.Don't hit the snooze button. Hitting the snooze button has been shown to be more harmful than helpful because the extra few minutes you get when you hit snooze do not actually provide you with quality rest., Sometimes getting up early is enough to put someone in a bad mood and set a negative tone for the entire day. Setting aside a few minutes every morning to focus on positive things can help get your day off to a better start. Avoid watching the news or reading about things that will upset you first thing in the morning.


Try journaling about a happy memory or reading a positive quote or story. If you are religious, you could take a few minutes to read from a spiritual text and consider the verses you read."
"
Give yourself plenty of time.,
Connect with family or friends.,
Work on an important project.,
Meditate or pray.",How to Start a Day in a Healthy Way3," Having to rush around to get ready in the morning does not start your day on a good note. In fact, you may end up having extra stress first thing in the morning because you have to rush. If you often find yourself rushing or running late, you may need to start waking up a bit earlier to give yourself more time to get ready. Try setting your alarm for 15 minutes before your normal wake-up time to see how it changes your morning routine.

, Even if you are in a hurry in the morning, taking a few moments to connect with your family or friends can help get your day off to a great start. Simply taking a second to give your family members a hug and say “I love you,” or tell your roommate to have a good day can be beneficial. A twenty second hug in the morning can help your body to release dopamine and oxytocin, which will make you feel good and help relieve stress., Your brain is more capable of handling difficult tasks first thing in the morning, so it’s best to use your early morning time to focus on important projects, rather than on menial tasks like answering emails. You are also less likely to be interrupted by your loved ones or coworkers early in the morning. As the day goes on, you can shift to working on things that are easier or less important., In order to have a relaxing start to your day, you may need to set aside some time to meditate or pray. Taking about 5-10 minutes to sit quietly with your thoughts and breathe will help set a relaxing tone for your day. If you have a lot on your plate, taking time to meditate or pray can also help to alleviate some of your stress and anxiety about being able to complete everything."

Visit a health care provider for a screening.",How to Keep Yourself Healthy at Work," Getting a workout in before your shift can energize you for the day ahead. It has the added benefit of cutting down on your transportation costs. If you live relatively close to where you work, consider these strategies to get in a bit of exercise before your workday even properly begins:


Commute to work on a bike. Wear proper safety gear such as a helmet and pads, or a reflective vest so that drivers can see you clearly.
Select one or two days a week to jog to work. Jogging on a commute may require you to keep a change of clothes at your workplace. A facility with a locker room or changing area may also be necessary.
If distance and time allow for it, choose a nice day to walk to and from work. Take in the fresh air and use this time to clear your thoughts and relax before heading into the office. You might even walk to public transportation stops. Public transportation might be a commute option for you. If so, choose a route that will allow you to walk part of the way.
You might even consider an unconventional way of exercising on your way to work, such as kayaking down a river to get to work or skateboarding to work.;
, If you go home first, you might be tempted to stay at home and skip your workout altogether. Starting your workout routine at the end of your workday might give you more motivation to exercise and for a more consistent routine.


Or, you might consider hitting the gym before you go to work in the morning. Studies have shown that you can burn more calories throughout the day by exercising in the morning. However, it is also important to choose a time of day that will work for you so you are more likely to stick with your routine., Getting healthy is a big goal and it can include many things. Try to take some time to identify the individual goals you are working towards, such as losing 10 pounds, improving your mile run time, or simply eating fewer unhealthy foods.

Make sure that you set goals that are SMART. This means that your goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time bound.An example of a SMART goal might be something like, “I want to lose 10 pounds over the course of the next eight weeks.”
Seek support from your friends and family as you work towards your goals. Let them know that you are trying to be healthier at work and ask for their support.

, Some jobs have more flexible work hours, allowing employees to take longer breaks if the time is made up during the shift.


Take advantage of your company's on-site gym if one is available. They may also be partnered with a nearby fitness center.
Organize a basketball game in the parking lot with a few of your coworkers.
Toss a baseball or football around with a work buddy.
An extended work break is a good time to get in a long distance jog.
Or, you could hit the gym during your lunch break and just have a light bite for lunch after you finish.

, If you have a sedentary job (lots of sitting around), moving around more during the course of the day is a good way to increase your activity level.


Take the stairs in your building (if you work in a skyscraper it may not be practical to climb the stairs to your office on the 34th floor).
Lift more weight than you're used to. If the office needs more photocopy paper, make an exercise of it - take a few trips to carry each box instead of using a cart.
Walk to a coworker's desk instead of calling them on the phone. You'll increase the number of steps you take each day and appear more personable.
If you must eat lunch away from work, walk there. Getting a carry out order and bringing it back to eat at work will increase your appetite. However, keep in mind that packing a lunch is usually healthier. If you have to order your lunch, then try to order something healthy.

, Break time is a worker's right that shouldn't be taken for granted. Use that time effectively and you'll be healthier for it!


How you put break time to use depends on the type of job you do. If you need rest, take a breather. If you've been sitting all day, get up and move around!
Know the break time policies at your place of work. Ask a supervisor if you're not sure. Follow them and don't abuse them.
Take a walk whenever you get a break. Create different routes in the corridors of your building or outside if the weather is nice.
If your break time is limited there are exercises that you can do at your desk.Stretch out your limbs. Shake off the fatigue. Get your blood flowing!

, If your job involves intense physical or mental activity, take time to unwind. Stepping away for a few moments can help calm and re-focus your mind on the task at hand.


Periods of high stress are when we often fall back on bad habits. Resist the urge to cope with caffeine, a cigarette, or sweets. All three will only serve to keep you wound up.
If you feel overwhelmed by your work load, wash your face with cold water, stretch your body and take several deep breaths. The additional influx of oxygen to your body will help increase your focus and productivity at work.
The workday can be hectic for many people. If that's you, take a break to de-stress. There are many options available: meditation, prayer, or reading. Choose something you enjoy!
If you need to blow off some steam, vent a little by talking to a trusted friend or colleague.

, Calorie counting is not a diet, but a way to keep track of the amount of energy that comes from food and the amount of energy used by your body.There are several ways to count calories. Many fitness websites and apps have built-in calculators to help you.
If daily calories from food total more than the daily number of calories you burn, you may be gaining weight.
If daily calories from food total less than the daily number of calories you burn, you will probably lose weight.

, We've all heard that ""breakfast is the most important meal of the day."" But there's really truth to this saying! Studies have shown a relationship between eating a responsible breakfast and lower body weight, or less weight gain over time.


Oatmeal, cereal, a slice of whole-wheat toast, fresh fruit, and yogurt are all healthy choices.
A good breakfast may be more helpful than hitting the snooze button on your alarm clock. Make time in the morning to fit breakfast into your pre-work routine.
If you are pressed for time in the morning, try fixing breakfast ahead of time. Hot or cold cereal can be prepared in batches and dished out into individual containers for you to eat on the run. Fresh fruit is also easy to eat on the go.
Sometimes it's more convenient to grab food on your commute. In that case, choose healthier options: a muffin, ""to go"" servings of oatmeal, or a yogurt.

, Sure, it puts some extra pep in your step. But like any drug, it is possible to overdose on caffeine, causing irritability, restlessness, and sleepless nights. None of those symptoms helps you be your best at work!


Cap your caffeine consumption at 400 milligrams per day. That's the equivalent of 4 cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola, or 2 energy shot drinks.Establish a caffeine schedule to distribute your consumption more evenly. For example, have an espresso in the morning, a cup of brewed coffee before lunch, and another in the afternoon. To help you sleep, set a time of day (like 4:00 pm) after which you won't drink caffeine.
Tea can be a lower caffeine alternative to coffee, depending on the type of tea and the serving size.Counteract your daily coffee house fix with alternatives: orange juice, skim milk, water, and/or plain brewed coffee.
Many caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, and cola have low-caffeine or no-caffeine versions.

, Lunch plans left to the last minute often tend to be the least healthy choices, especially when your workplace is surrounded by fast food joints and you find yourself pressed for time. Give yourself time to think about healthier alternatives.


Look for healthy options during a restaurant lunch meeting. Many restaurant chains now offer low calorie or diet selections for health-conscious customers.
A ready made salad or take-away salad bar is a good option if you work near a large grocery store chain.
Food trucks have become very popular by parking lots of meal choices right outside your work site. It's still up to you to make those choices healthy ones! Look for a truck that offers salads or healthy wraps.
Salad vending machines are the latest trend in healthy lunches.Look for them to appear in a city near you!

, Taking the time to prepare healthy meals at home is often the best way to ensure a nutritious lunch. By carefully selecting ingredients at the grocery store, you can better count calories and avoid foods that you're intolerant or allergic to.


A healthy lunch made at home might consist of brown rice (with vegetables) and grilled or baked chicken. (Brown rice offers extra dietary fiber and chicken is lean meat with lots of protein.)
Home cooked leftovers can also be a healthier alternative to eating out, depending on the dish.
Brown bag it: pack a sack lunch with a sandwich, cut vegetables like celery sticks, and a healthy treat like fruit flavored yogurt or fresh fruit.
If you're pressed for time before work, bring a can of soup that can be heated up in a microwave safe container. Avoid varieties of soup that are high in sodium.

, When it comes to consuming unnecessary calories at work, snacks and drinks are a common culprit. Foods you eat while ""grazing"" at your desk or in the break room often go unnoticed, even if you're counting calories.


Reach for a low-calorie snack if you feel hungry before lunch. Bring a bag of pretzels, reduced-fat popcorn, or cut vegetables with low-fat dressing for dipping. These will keep you satiated without the guilt.
Avoid high-calorie sodas and sugary juices at all times. Instead drink something that will increase your metabolism and also doesn't increase your calories, like green tea.
Stay hydrated! Water is always a smart choice. It's a crucial nutrient for your body without taking in any additional calories. Keeping yourself hydrated means keeping your brain hydrated as well, which results in clearer thinking.Chew gum as an alternative to mindless snacking. Avoid gum that is high in sugar or artificial ingredients.
Resist treats at work. Coworkers may often bring baked goods to share or hold potlucks where everyone brings a dish to pass. If you can't avoid them, eat wisely and don't overindulge.

, Workplace wellness programs are activities or policies designed to support healthy behaviors and improve health outcomes while at work More employers are recognizing that healthy workers are productive workers and that prevention is cheaper than paying for health care costs down the road.


Your Human Resources representative is the best person to ask. Your supervisor(s) might also be able to help you.
Some labor unions offer workplace wellness services. If you belong to a union, ask your local steward for more information.
Sometimes you can even get a deduction on your health insurance if you do things like go to the gym and work with a wellness coach.

, Fitting a job to a person's body is called ergonomics. The goal of ergonomics is to position your body in order to avoid long term muscle and joint problems.Gel and foam pads are available to cushion the wrists as you type on a keyboard. They are designed to protect against Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
Adjust the height of your chair and computer screen to accommodate your height and promote good sitting posture.
Some people opt for a computer-mounted workstation that allows them to stand up while they work.
Ergonomic floor pads cushion the feet and leg joints if your job requires you to stand in place for extended periods of time.
If you have trouble seeing your computer screen clearly, ask your supervisor or IT professional if you can get a larger monitor. You may even be able to hook up two or three monitors to your desk workstation!

, There is strength in numbers! Sometimes it can be easier to meet health and fitness goals as part of a group effort.


Form a weight loss club. Count and track calories together. Support each other through difficult times and cheer each other on. A dieting group can help you withstand the temptation of work treats!
Find a workout buddy. Jogging or walking during breaks may be more fun as a social activity. Workout partners also help to keep the other partner accountable to their goals.
Find out if your company offers intramural sports, like a softball or basketball team. Team sports provide both fitness and camaraderie!
Quitting smoking may also be easier if you don't have to do it alone. Even if you only want to cut back for now, you may be able to find a coworker willing to make the same goal.

, With rising healthcare costs and obesity epidemics, more and more emphasis will be put on preventative health. Look for fitness and nutrition to be a bigger part of health care in the future.


Many community health centers are partners in workplace wellness initiatives and might be a good source for more information.
Consult your health insurance plan. If your employer has wellness policies in place, they are probably already part of your benefits package. Call the insurance provider customer service line or talk to your HR rep.
Some employers may pay part of your gym membership as an employee benefit.
If you are a public servant, some gyms may offer you a discount. Ask your local gym if membership discounts are available for firemen or police officers.

, An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Be proactive about your health. Not only will you feel better at work, but it will help you conserve sick days and be more productive!

Effective workplace wellness programs can help reduce the risk of heart disease, also called cardiovascular disease or CVD.You may be required to visit a doctor to test your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Some employers provide free on-site screenings to check for CVD risk factors: blood pressure, weight, body mass index or body fat percentage.Some employers provide free seasonal flu shots. Getting a flu shot can protect you from that virus being passed around the office. Annual flu shots may also be covered by your insurance plan.

Remain focused on your work.,
Meet with your boss.",How to Protect Yourself from Blame at Work," It’s hard to prove what you told someone in person or over the phone. However, it’s much easier to prove the contents of an email—you simply print it off. If possible, communicate with everyone using email.Use email with coworkers and your boss, but also with your clients and the public.
If you need to have conversations in person, you can follow up the conversation with an email. Summarize the substance of the conversation.
Avoid secretly recording people. The law on secretly recording people differs depending on your state. In a dozen states, you cannot record a conversation unless you get the consent of all people who are involved.;
, Did you have something hand-delivered to another department? Did you mail something to a client? If so, you’ll always want signatures showing that the item was received. In the U.S., you can use certified mail, return receipt requested., If you don’t know how to proceed, ask someone higher up to make the call. If they get the call wrong, then it’s their fault. Send an email with your question and save a copy of their answer.You might hesitate asking questions because you want to appear like you know everything. Nevertheless, you need to do something right, otherwise you truly will warrant blame.
Remember not to ask a question twice. Once a supervisor tells you how to do something, write it down so that you remember it. If you keep asking questions, you’ll look incompetent.

, Sometimes you can get blamed when a client’s business decision doesn’t pan out. Although the client made the decision, they will claim you didn’t inform them of the risks. You always want people to make an informed decision, so explain risks thoroughly.


Also have the client sign a form stating they have been informed of the risks. List the most relevant risks on the form.
Hold onto the signed form in case the client claims later that you didn’t tell them of the dangers.

, You can weather false accusations if you have a strong reputation in the eyes of your boss and most of your colleagues. Begin building your reputation by maintaining a positive attitude. Smile and say “Good morning” or “hello” to everyone that you meet.


Handle difficult coworkers delicately. Try to see issues from their point of view, which can help defuse tension and allow you to remain positive.Get enough sleep so that you are fully rested when you come in. Crabby people can be complainers.
Some work environments are so toxic that you cannot stay positive. In that situation, you need to seriously consider leaving your job and finding another one.

, This depends on your workplace. Most people will appreciate the extra pair of hands when they are swamped. However, you don’t want to help out too much because it makes you look like you don’t have enough to do.Also pay attention to whether your coworker gives you credit for the work that you did. If they don’t, you should stop helping that person.
However, if they do give you credit, then you can help them out in the future. They appreciate your help and don’t see you as a threat.

, When you tell a colleague you will do something, remember to follow through. Leave the excuses at home and make sure to fulfill your responsibilities. Consistent follow through will increase your credibility in other people’s eyes.


Try to be predictably reliable.If you are, people will be less likely to blame you when something goes wrong.

, You’ll help build your credibility if you honestly admit your mistakes. People who always deny responsibility begin to look like liars. Instead, fess up. Say, “I’m sorry” and then explain the following:You understand the seriousness of the mistake. For example, you can say, “I realize this mistake might cost us the client account.”
You know how it happened. For example, “I was preparing the packages for mail when Sue called and I got sidetracked.”
You are taking steps to make sure it doesn’t happen again: “To ensure I don’t make this mistake again, I’ll let calls go to voicemail when I’m preparing our packages for mail.”

, If you have social media accounts, make sure they reflect positively on you. Update your LinkedIn profile and remove offensive material from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. Think about making personal accounts private.


Google yourself as well. Look at the first page of results. You want that first page to reflect positively on you.It’s hard to remove negative information from Google. However, you can push it off the front page by publishing something in a newspaper or trade magazine. Alternately, you can volunteer and then write an article or give an interview to a local reporter.

, No one likes to be blamed for mistakes at work. When your boss calls you into their office, your heart might be beating in your throat. Try to relax as much as possible. Sit comfortably and take a deep breath.You want to remain calm so that you can actually hear the accusations. Try to write down what your boss has said you did wrong. You might not remember exactly what was said when you leave the office, so you need good notes.
Remember not to immediately get defensive. Your boss might be too angry to really hear you, either. Unless you are being fired, you should have time to go back to your office and gather your thoughts.
If you didn’t do something, calmly say, “I didn’t do that.” Your boss might not hear you, but you need to say it.

, “Blame” is a troubling word. It suggests only one person is responsible when things go wrong. However, many people might have contributed to the problem. Honestly assess whether you are in any way responsible.


If you are, then analyze what you could have done differently. When you fess up to the mistake, you need to explain how it happened and what you’ll do differently.
Don’t blame someone else for the mistake either unless you have documented proof that they make the error.

, Hopefully, you’ve kept emails, notes, and memos that back up your story. Find them now and make copies. Remember not to give your supervisor originals of anything.


Put the documents in some sort of order. If your boss told you to do something in an email—and that’s why you’re being blamed—then put that email on top.
Use a highlighter to highlight relevant information in emails and other documents. You can’t expect your boss to read through fifty pages of material to find what is relevant.

, Your coworkers can be great witnesses if they back up your story.One reason you want to build relationships with coworkers is for precisely these moments—you’ve been blamed for something you didn’t do. Talk to your coworkers and ask if they will talk to your boss on your behalf.


You shouldn’t ask your coworkers to attend your meeting with your boss, because your boss might not assume they are telling the truth if you are in the room. Instead, they can meet afterwards or summarize what they know in an email.

, Even as you begin to pull together a defense, you must continue to do your job well.Spend lunch breaks and after-work hours putting your defense together. You won’t be doing yourself any favors if you make a big mistake at work because your mind is elsewhere.

, After a day or two, schedule an appointment with your boss. Everyone should have calmed down by now. You can gather your supporting documents and the names of the coworkers who have agreed to act as your witnesses.


Open your meeting by summarizing what you have been accused of. Then segue into your side of the story.
You can say, “I was just too emotional to tell you this yesterday, but now that I’ve had time to think, I want to share what really happened.”
Back up your statements with documents. You can say, “See, I have that email from accounting right here. Janet said that the account had $1,000 still in it. That’s why I spent the money.”

Find PEOs.,
Consider the downsides of joining a PEO.,
Appreciate the added benefits of a PEO.,
Contact PEOs for quotes.,
Research whether the PEO is legitimate.",How to Reduce Workers Compensation Premiums1," A professional employer organization (PEO) can help lower your workers’ compensation premiums. The PEO purchases insurance for many different employers at once and can get rates that a larger organization would.You can find PEOs in the following places:


Use the directory at the National Association of Professional Employer Organizations here: http://www.napeo.org/what-is-a-peo/selecting-a-peo/find-a-peo. Search by state.
Perform a general Internet search. Type your location and “professional employer organization” into your favorite search engine.;
, When you join a PEO, your employees become co-employees of the PEO. In practice, this means that you will still control your business. However, the PEO is in control of anything that is related to human resources, such as payroll.For example, before a PEO will agree to work with you, you may need to deal with any payroll arrearages. You will also need to follow the PEO’s best practices when it comes to human resources.
PEOs also typically contract with one insurance carrier. They aren’t brokers, who will obtain insurance from many different carriers. For this reason, you may be stuck with the insurance carrier they select.

, Your PEO can handle all sorts of human resources functions for you. For example, they can handle payroll, employee benefits, and 401(k) accounts.They can also help injured employees return to the workplace as soon as possible.

, Before you hire a PEO, you should understand how much they will charge. Call or contact them online and ask for a quote. Generally, a PEO charges $500 to $1,500 per employee per year.The PEO may need to visit your jobsite. Schedule a time that works for you.
You might also want the PEO to perform other human resource functions for you. Make sure the PEO includes those services in your quote.

, Although you may buy your workers’ compensation insurance through the PEO, you are still responsible for making sure you get adequate insurance coverage. Confirm that your PEO is legitimate:Ask for company references and check them. Ask references if they have ever had a workers’ compensation claim and whether they were pleased with how the PEO handled it.
Ask to see the PEO’s certificate of insurance.
Check whether the PEO is a member of a national or state organization for PEOs.
Analyze the contract you sign with the PEO. If you don’t have experience with contracts, then retain the services of a business lawyer to help you analyze the contract.
Look up the company on Consumer Affairs to read reviews."

A PEO will handle all payroll processing and tax filings. They also purchase workers’ compensation insurance.Because the PEO is buying insurance for many businesses, they can command a lower price than you could if you bought on the market by yourself. Accordingly, PEOs can save you money by reducing your premiums.
PEOs can also analyze the safety of your workplace, which will be helpful if you create a safety program.They also work with injured employees and help implement return-to-work programs, which you should also create.;
, Workers’ compensation premiums are calculated based on the risk of each type of job. Employees are assigned an employee classification, and a rate is assigned to account for the risk. Rates are calculated per $100.00 of payroll. Each state sets its rates. Accordingly, you want to make sure your employees are properly classified.


For example, employees engaged in production of plastic tubes might have a higher rate than those who work in plastic assembly. You don’t want your assemblers to be misclassified in the more expensive classification.You can find the classification codes at your state’s workers’ compensation ratings bureau.

, Create a spreadsheet of your employees and the corresponding classification code. You will want to send this to your insurer, along with a letter in which you object to the way the insurer classified certain employees.If your insurer agrees, they will lower your premiums. However, you should consider appealing to your state’s workers’ compensation rating bureau if they deny you.

, Workers’ compensation premiums are calculated twice. Your initial premium is a rough estimate. Your insurer will also audit you at the end of the year. The purpose of this audit is to check that the classification codes are accurate.Depending on the results of the audit, you might have to pay more, or you may get a rebate for having paid too much during the year.


You should appoint one person to communicate with the auditor. This helps to streamline the process. Make sure to choose someone who is friendly and works well with others. Auditors may be hostile.
Gather all information on employee payroll ahead of time, including number of employees, hours worked, and the amount paid.Carefully review your audit statement, which should be sent to you within a few months of the audit. Raise any objections to employee classifications in writing.

, You can search online for a model safety program for your industry. Google your industry and “safety program.” You may have to pay $100-150 for the template.This is a very cost-effective method for creating a basic safety program. However, you may need to revise the template to suit your individual needs.
If necessary, reach out to a consultant. They typically charge $100 an hour for their services. You can find consultants by asking other businesses in your industry who they use.

, Many insurers provide consultation services to help you develop a safety plan.Take out your insurance policy and check whether this service has been provided as part of your coverage.


If you’re just starting out, you should make sure your insurer offers these services. You typically have to pay extra. However, for every dollar you spend on safety, you reap two to six dollars in return.

, The federal Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) offers an on-site consultation program, which is free for small and medium-sized businesses.You can reach the nearest OSHA office in your state by visiting this website: https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/smallbusiness/consult_directory.html.


When the consultant visits, they will walk through your jobsite and point out any safety hazards or health risks. Later, they will send you a written report. The consultant may also call you from time to time in the future to see how well you are implementing the safety program.
Realize, however, that you’ll need to follow through with OSHA’s recommendations otherwise you may be referred to OSHA’s enforcement action branch.By contrast, if you use a private consultant, then you can choose the most cost-effective recommendations and skip some of the more expensive ones.

, It’s one thing to have a plan on paper. You also need to make sure employees follow through with the plan. Make sure top management approves of the plan and is fully committed to it.You’ll also need to hold regular safety meetings to discuss safety issues. At the meetings, you hammer home the importance of safety. You can also answer employee questions.
Remember to put some teeth into your safety program by disciplining employees for violating the safety rules and rewarding those who follow them.

, Improving safety is a continuous process. Don’t wait for someone to be injured before analyzing how you can improve safety. Near misses and accidents that don’t result in injury should be analyzed.If you are a medium or large business, you should centralize your incident reporting. This will allow you to see the “big picture” when it comes to your safety culture. Have all information entered into one database.

, You’ll want an injured employee to return to work as soon as possible. Accordingly, you should have a written policy in place. There are sample policies online you can use as models for drafting your own.Your policy should have a section discussing transitional work. Transitional work consists of work assignments modified to account for the employee’s injury. For example, if an employee has reduced mobility, you can have them temporarily do computer-based tasks.

, You should send your first accident report to your insurer within 24 hours, so don’t delay. Make sure to provide as much detail in the report as possible.You can also include photographs of where the injury took place. Note any obvious hazards. Use a digital camera that will record the date, and take pictures from many different angles.
Refusing to provide the first report won’t make the workers’ compensation claim disappear. Instead, you are committing fraud as an employer., In many states, you can’t get off the hook if the employee was intoxicated or high. However, you can certainly help bolster your case. Ask the injured worker to take a drug test as soon as possible.Also consider making random drug testing part of your safety plan. These are legal so long as you tell applicants upfront that participation in drug testing is a part of the job. The mere threat of drug testing can reduce accidents on the job.

, Once an employee files a claim, your insurer will need information from you. Comply with requests for information in a timely manner. For example, you may need to do the following, depending on your circumstances:Provide information on the employee’s payroll history.
Share the employee’s personnel file.
Double check the employee’s story with their co-workers or supervisor.
Tell your insurer if you are contacted by the injured employee’s attorney. Your insurer will handle communications with them.

, Most workers’ compensation claims have merit. However, there are also an estimated billion dollars paid out in fraudulent benefits. Look for the following signs of fraud and contact your insurer if you see any:The accident is reported Monday morning, either because it happened Monday morning or the accident happened Friday afternoon and the employee waited to report it.
The employee has suspicious doctors and/or lawyers helping them. Some lawyers run workers’ compensation mills where all of their clients meet with the same doctor.
The employee won’t meet with an independent doctor to verify the extent of their injury.
You have a hard time contacting the employee—even though they claim to be laid up or disabled.
There are no witnesses when you would expect there to be.
The employee’s own story doesn’t make sense, or they tell contradictory stories.

, Your insurer might decide to investigate a suspicious workers’ compensation claim. For example, if the employee claims to be disabled but is seen shoveling their driveway, then they are not disabled.


You might want to hire your own investigator if the insurance company doesn’t. Remember that your premiums will increase if someone files a really expensive claim or if multiple people file smaller claims.Accordingly, you want to weed out fraudulent claims.
However, if you buy insurance through a PEO, then fighting a claim might not be worth your time. Talk to your insurer.

, The claims process differs slightly depending on your state. However, in some states, employers will be asked whether they agree with the employee’s explanation of events that led to the injury. If you agree, then you’ll approve the claim. If you disagree, then you reject the claim.Your state’s Workers’ Compensation Board or Commission has the ultimate say on whether to approve claims. However, an employer’s approval can speed up the process.
If you disagree with the employee’s claim, talk to your insurer about how to proceed.

, Analyze whether you can use the employee in a modified capacity, at least during a transitional period. For example, an employee might have a wealth of knowledge to share. You can create transitional work where the injured employee supervises others without performing manual labor themselves.


Check whether work modification funds are available from your state’s Department of Labor (or equivalent department). You can use these funds to buy special equipment that helps your injured employee return to work.For example, you could buy a high-backed chair that eases the pain in an employee’s upper back and neck.
Remember that you can’t fire someone simply because they filed a workers’ compensation claim.Instead, you should be focused on getting them back to work as soon as possible, which will reduce your costs.

Tests are administered three times each year, with a testing window of eight days each February, June, and October.Candidates can find a comprehensive listing of test locations online by searching for FSOT test center locations. There is no explicit cut-off score for the examination. Instead, each candidate's overall portfolio is examined in the context of his desired career track.Skills are assessed in each of the following categories:


Job knowledge - this category includes multiple choice questions that test the candidate's knowledge of US history and culture, government, world history, finance/economics, and international affairs.English expression - this multiple-choice category tests the candidate's writing and communication skills.Biographic information - this portion of the exam requires the candidate to self-assess his work style, communication skills, and awareness/respect of other cultures.An assigned topic, about which candidates must write an articulate essay in under 30 minutes., Candidates who do well on the FSOT will receive an email from the US Department of State requesting a personal narrative, which will be submitted to the Qualifications Evaluation Panel (QEP) no later than three weeks from the date the request is sent.The personal narrative allows the candidate to elaborate on his experiences and qualifications. Candidates should focus on providing concrete, positive examples of their abilities, while also addressing how their learning experiences would contribute to a successful career as an FSO.The candidate's PN is evaluated on its ability to address each of the six precepts used by the QEP as predictors of Foreign Service success.


Leadership - the QEP assesses the candidate's ability to innovate, make decisions, and work as part of a team.Interpersonal Skills - the candidate's professional standards are evaluated, including his ability to persuade, adapt, and negotiate.Communication Skills - the QEP evaluates the candidate's written and oral communication skills, his ability to actively listen and learn, and his existing foreign language skills, if relevant.Management Skills - the candidate's effectiveness at evaluating, managing, and conducting operations are evaluated by the QEP.Intellectual Skills - the QEP assesses the candidate's critical thinking and active learning abilities, as well as his ability to gather and analyze information.Substantive Knowledge - the QEP examines the candidate's knowledge and understanding of US history, government, and culture, and his potential ability to interact with other cultures., The oral assessment is typically held in Washington, DC, though the Board of Examiners also holds Oral Assessments in San Francisco, CA, if the necessary resources there are available.Candidates have a narrow window for taking the Oral Assessment, and the assessment date is determined by when the candidate took the FSOT.The Oral Assessment is an all-day evaluation which will do each of the following:


measure the candidate's skills in each of the outlined 13 dimensionsmeasure the candidate's ability to meet the tasks and duties of the Foreign Serviceassess the candidate's skills and personal characteristics, and compare those skills and characteristics with the essential duties within the candidate's preferred career track, Candidates who do well in the Oral Assessment will be given a conditional offer of employment, pending the candidate's ability to obtain medical and security clearance.


Medical clearance will be given by either The Office of Medical Services or the Department of State, and is contingent upon the candidate's medical history and his current and projected medical needs. Medical clearance factors in the potentially limited medical resources available at certain Embassy locations around the world.[
Security clearance will be given by the US Department of State, following a thorough background investigation that examines the candidate's employment history, credit history, criminal record, history of substance abuse, and his history of loan and tax payments.Candidates with dual citizenship status, candidates who have extensively stayed abroad for travel, education, or employment purposes, candidates with a foreign-born spouse, and candidates with immediate family members who are not US citizens may experience longer wait periods before clearance is given., Once the background investigation is complete, a Suitability Review Panel will evaluate all of the candidate's materials (with the exception of some medical information) to determine whether the candidate is fit for service as a Foreign Service Officer. The Suitability Review Panel specifically examines:


employment history, including instances of misconduct, poor performance, and inability to collaborate with othersfinancial irresponsibilitycriminal history and personal misconductany instances of deception or fraud during the application processhistory of alcohol use, specifically with regard to the candidate's ability to manage professional expectationsuse or sale/transportation of controlled substancesthe candidate's loyalty to the American governmentany personal or professional instances of poor judgment or lack of discretion, Candidates who successfully pass all examinations and reviews are placed on a hiring register. The register lists candidates by career track and by rankings, which are determined by the candidate's test scores and evaluations. A candidate's position on the register will only last a maximum of 18 months. If the candidate has not received a final job offer after 18 months, his name will be taken off the list, and he will have to complete the application process from the beginning., Candidates who are given an offer of employment will typically be required to move to Washington, DC, often with only a few weeks' notice. Candidates are permitted to decline only one job offer. If the candidate declines a second job offer or cannot meet the training requirements a second time, his name is removed from the hiring register.Certain prior obligations, such as overseas deployment in the military, are permitted as reasonable eligibility for job appointment deferment. However, deferments are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and are rarely granted, even for highly-qualified candidates.For this reason, anyone wishing to work for the Department of State should be prepared to relocate for training and assignment on short notice.

, All new Foreign Service Officers are required to complete the A-100 course, a six-week training and orientation program. During that time FSOs receive enhanced skills training to meet the needs of their Foreign Service appointment., The specialized training a new FSO receives is determined by that officer's work assignment. FSOs who do not speak a foreign language may be required to attend an additional six to nine months of foreign language training, depending on the officer's work assignment. The overall training process for new officers can take up to one year before the officer is assigned to his overseas post."

Understand a workers’ compensation audit.,
Provide accurate information.,
Review how your employees were classified.,
Challenge wrong classifications.,
Hire a consultant.",How to Reduce Workers Compensation Premiums2," Workers’ compensation premiums are calculated twice. When you buy the policy, the insurance carrier creates a rough estimate of your costs. However, at the end of the year, the carrier will perform an audit, which will determine the real rate.Depending on your audit, you may need to pay more money or you may get a rebate.


Your insurance carrier may schedule an on-site audit, or they may send you paperwork to complete and then return on your own.
If an auditor is visiting, make sure to appoint one person to interface with the auditor. This person should have a full understanding of your company and be personable. The audit doesn’t need to be stressful. However, it can be if the auditor thinks you aren’t complying with their requests for information.

, Workers’ compensation premiums depend in part on how much you pay each employee. Accordingly, you will need to gather payroll information to prepare for the audit. Make sure this information is accurate.


For example, you’ll have to provide payroll journal and federal tax reports.
You’ll also need to provide a detailed list of each employee’s job duties.Ensure that all information is updated and accurate before the audit.

, An insurer calculates your premiums based on the risk of your business. Your business will be assigned a classification, and each classification has its own base rate. In some industries, each employee is provided a classification.The insurer multiplies the base rate by each $100 of payroll. You should make sure your employees are properly classified.


Wrong classifications can make a big difference in your premiums. For example, a plastics assembler has a lower rate than a plastics producer.If assemblers are misclassified, you’ll end up paying too much for premiums.
Most states use classification codes set by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI). You can find your state’s codes by contacting your state’s workers’ compensation board., You should create a spreadsheet of all employees and then double check whether your insurance carrier has properly classified each employee. Enter what you think is the proper classification.


You can send the spreadsheet to your insurance carrier along with a letter asking that they correct the misclassification.
You can raise this issue after an audit. However, you can raise misclassification at any time, even as soon as you receive your policy.
There should be an appeals process you can use if you disagree with your insurance carrier’s resolution. Ultimately, the NCCI may need to inspect your jobsite., You might find this area too complex to navigate on your own. If so, you should hire a workers’ compensation consultant who can review your policy for errors. They can also advocate on your behalf with your insurance company.Search online for “workers’ compensation audit consultant.”

Use OSHA’s on-site consultation program.,
Get management onboard.,
Train employees in safety.,
Investigate all incidents, no matter how small.,
Create return-to-work policies.,
Follow proper reporting.",How to Reduce Workers Compensation Premiums3," Safety programs help reduce injuries and can create big savings. The easiest way to create a safety program is to review safety programs for other businesses. You can search online and use it as a guide for drafting your own. Search for a program specific to your industry.


You might need to pay a couple hundred dollars for a sample plan.You can also hire a consultant to help you develop your program. Ask another business if they’ve used a consultant, and call for a quote. Consultants usually charge about $100 per hour.
Should you hire a PEO, they can also help you develop a safety program.

, Some insurance policies include help with developing a safety program.Review your insurance policy or call your carrier and ask if they provide help.

, The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) has consultants who can help you create a safety plan. The program is free for smaller businesses.The consultant walks through your facility and identifies hazards, then provides you with a written report.


To find your nearest OSHA office, visit https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/smallbusiness/consult_directory.html. You can search by state.
The consultant won’t report any safety hazards to OSHA. However, they may report you if you don’t follow through on their safety recommendations.

, You can’t implement a successful safety program unless management is onboard.Hold meetings and address any concerns they may have.


Costs may be one concern. However, you should point out that studies show each dollar spent on safety reaps about two to six dollars of savings in return., You can instill in your employees the importance of safety by discussing new safety measures in regularly-scheduled trainings. Be willing to answer any questions employees have and stress the importance of safety.


Provide training when you first hire employees or transfer them between departments. Also provide training when you implement new processes or uncover new hazards.Remember to discipline for any violations. Employees won’t take your safety program seriously if they can violate the rules and not be punished.

, Not every incident results in an injury. However, you should investigate all of them.You may realize that you need to improve or otherwise change your current safety program to address the hazard.


As you investigate, remember to tell your employees that you aren’t searching for someone to blame. Instead, you are trying to find out all the facts so that you can identify the cause of the incident.
Remember to monitor results. If incidents continue to occur, then you likely haven’t properly address the problem.

, The longer your injured employees stay out of work, the more your insurance carrier will have to pay them. Another way to lower your premiums is to get injured employees back to work as soon as possible. Accordingly, you should create a return-to-work policy.


You can find sample policies online to use as a guide for your own.A key component of any return-to-work policy is transitional work. You can modify someone’s schedule or adjust a job to accommodate the worker’s injury. For example, if an employee has reduced mobility, you can have them temporarily do computer-based tasks.

, If an accident should happen, you should immediately get the employee medical attention so that they can minimize any injury. Once the employee is stable, file reports with your workers’ compensation board.Avoid delay. Your state law will give you a deadline for reporting the injury and you shouldn’t miss it. Ideally, you should report as soon as possible.
You should also mail a copy of the report to your insurance carrier.

Know your exact financial status at your job.,
Gather any positive feedback to bolster your argument.,
Investigate the pay range for your job and level of experience within the industry.,
Take timing into account.,
Format the letter appropriately.,
Start with a cordial statement about your job satisfaction.,
Highlight your past accomplishments.,
State your rate of compensation in relation to the industry standard.,
Ask for a specific amount.,
Conclude cordially.",How to Write a Compensation Proposal," This seems obvious, but the first step is knowing exactly how much money you make. Also make note of the last time you received a pay increase. You can then compare this information to the other data you'll find as you further investigate your field.If you're unaware of what your exact compensation is, collect your past pay stubs. If you don't have these, ask at the company payroll department for your financial history at the job.;
, The key to getting a salary increase is proving that you're an asset to your company. Good performance reviews, customer feedback, or any other information that attests to your value will help your case. Keep these records close at hand so you can cite them when you write your proposal.Not all companies do regular performance reviews. In this case, there are a few things you could do to gather information to help your case. For example, if you have team or planning meetings for your area or department, then these could be good opportunities to check in with your boss and assess your performance on a regular basis.
You could periodically schedule a meeting with your boss and ask how you're doing at your job. Make note of the feedback you receive. If your boss says you're doing a great job, use this as your positive feedback. If your boss tells you a few things you could improve upon, take that feedback seriously and work on those areas. Then when you write your letter, you can say how you've taken your boss's advice and improved.
If you have a direct supervisor who's not your boss, see if he or she will give you some feedback. If you get good feedback, you can ask your supervisor to write a letter to your boss about your good performance.
You may also consider looking for a mentor at work. If your company has a mentorship program, then indicate your interest to your supervisor. Or, if there is not mentorship program, then try talking with a more experienced, successful employee and see if they would be willing to be your mentor.
Take all feedback you receive without getting defensive. If you get some negative feedback, don't argue. Instead, take the advice and use it when you write your letter. You can demonstrate that you've taken feedback to heart and improved your performance.Keep in mind that businesses are results-driven, so it is important to put your emotions aside during this process.

, When asking for increased compensation, you have to be familiar with typical pay rates within the industry. This will show you whether it would be reasonable to ask for a raise or not.Use sites like PayScale or Glassdoor to research salaries within your industry.
For example, you might find that the average worker in your field earns between $45,000 and $50,000. If you're earning $44,000, you're below the average, and it would certainly be reasonable to ask for more money. You can use this as leverage when you write your proposal.
If, however, you're making $52,000, you might have trouble getting an increase. You boss could counter your request by saying that you make an above-average salary.
If you're earning above the industry average, you could still ask for a raise, but you'll need a lot of evidence that you're a true asset to the company. Financial figures would help most, because it would show your boss that he or she is making money with you around.

, Many times getting a pay increase is a matter of getting your boss at the right moment. If it's a particularly busy time of year, your boss might be overwhelmed and won't have the time to consider your request.Also consider the company's budget. If things have been tough for a while, your boss may not be able to give you a raise even if he wanted to. If earnings have been high, however, you can take advantage of both the availability of money and your boss' good mood by asking then.

, Remember, this is a formal business letter, and should be formatted accordingly.Place your name, title, and address on the top left of the paper.
Place the date below this.
Put your boss' name, title, and address below this.
Address your boss appropriately. Start with ""Dear Mr."" or ""Dear Mrs.""
Have 1-inch margins around the paper and use single spacing. Don't indent, just use a double space in between paragraphs.
End with ""Sincerely,"" then leave 4 lines so you can manually sign your name. Below this, type your name and title.

, Don't jump right into ""I need more money."" Ease your boss into your request by stating that you're glad to be working for this company.For example: Dear Mr. Smith, Please allow me to once again express my pride in working for this company. I appreciate all the opportunities this job has granted me.

, After the introduction, then establish your value to the company. Your boss may be legitimately unaware of your specific contributions to the company. Seeing them all laid out will help him or her see that you are indeed an asset to the company.Highlight all of the good work you've done to demonstrate that you deserve more money for your work.


You will need to provide concrete evidence of your performance in the letter. Be sure to include specific details, percentages, and figures about your contributions to the company. Avoid general statements such as, “I work hard” and “I do a great job.”
Mention how sales have increased in your department, or how customer satisfaction has gone up.
If you have any good performance reviews, cite them here. Also be sure to include copies of them with the letter.

, After establishing that you've worked hard for the company, then state your concern that you're earning less than the industry average. Again, your boss might actually be unaware of industry standards, so seeing all of the research presented may help make your point more convincing.Include exact figures here. State exactly what you're making, and then state what the industry average is. Point out what the discrepancy is.
If you're making above average, point out exactly why you're such an asset to the company that you deserve more.

, Don't simply ask for more money, tell your boss what your expectation is. This will allow your boss to look at the numbers and see if the company can afford your request.Write, ""In line with my performance for this company, I request a compensation increase of 3% annually, which will bring my yearly salary to $50,000.""
It is often good to ask for slightly more than you actually want so if your boss negotiates with you, you'll end up closer to what you actually want. Don't go overboard, however, or you'll seem unreasonable. For example, if you want a 2% raise, ask for 2.5 or 3%, not 10%., Always end on a positive note. Don't use any kind of ultimatum, like threatening to leave if you don't get your request.Stress your desire to continue working for the company and that you look forward to the future. Write that you're willing to discuss this matter with your boss any time."

Ensure that you and the remote worker are set up to achieve good lines of communication.,
Get the best technology tools available to you.",How to Work With People Overseas1," Consult your mutual manager to discuss some ideas on how to improve communication. The following are guidelines that managers with overseas employees often follow:


Keep common office hours. Email chains can take a lot longer than phone calls, so in order to ensure that you are able to talk to an overseas worker daily, adjust your office hours. Ask your manager if you can come in later and stay later. Perhaps, you can propose a compromise in hours, with the overseas worker adjusting their time toward yours by approximately 2 hours and you doing the same.
Plan to check in by phone once per day during busy, productive times and once per week in general. The amount that you need to communicate with an overseas worker will depend highly upon the project. When tensions are high, check in daily.
Choose the phone over email for important information. You may feel as though phone conversations are time consuming; however, they are more essential for communication with remote workers than with office workers. A remote worker may not have made a meeting or talked about something at the watercooler, so make the extra effort to update the worker by phone.;
, Virtual work is easier because of the cost effectiveness of teleconferencing and video conferencing. Consider these other technological tools.


Download an instant messaging program to your computers. Services such as Google Chat, Adium or Trillian allow you to communicate in real time without video or phone conferencing. Connect during shared office hours to share feedback. Make sure to set yourself as invisible if you are away and set limits if it becomes distracting.
Get a web camera for web/video conferencing. You can use a free service like Facetime, for Apple computers, or Skype. Many professional companies will deploy a high quality video communication solution that is more secure & immersive than free solutions, and ensures the solution has services and support attached. Talk to your employers to discuss video communication options to improve your remote connectivity.
Use a File Transfer Program (FTP). Emails with large attachments can clog up email systems or get rejected from servers. An FTP hosts a file for download from a remote location. Companies may choose to have an FTP bundled with their website services for ease of use.

Define work expectations.,
Over-communicate with feedback, rewards, and punishments.,
Treat Millennials as valued members of the staff.,
Give them meaningful work whenever possible.,
Figure out their goals, because their job is everything.,
Allow them their say.,
Be a mentor.,
Speak to Millennial employees in a positive, supportive tone.,
Offer other incentives besides pay.,
Understand that they're working on their own brand.,
Add freedom and fun to the workplace.,
Keep in mind that it's also about the older generation.",How to Work With Millennials," It's important to provide Millennials with concrete examples of what is expected of them in their jobs. Make sure they understand in detail the tasks you are assigning them to complete. Offer constructive criticism and praise as appropriate – they appreciate having a sense of how and what they're doing.


From a certain perspective, Millennials are used to having the world at their fingertips, with everything laid out before them for them to explore. As a general pattern, they constantly see options everywhere. Regardless of the task, they'll feel they have a better grip on it if the work expectations are clearly defined, limiting the routes a task can take in their active imaginations.A written job description can help keep Millennials on task with job expectations. They're very good at looking at something point blank and sticking to it – again, so long as everything is defined in the first place.;
, Again, Millennials expect nothing short of the whole truth and nothing but the truth. And they can handle it. They want to know exactly what is expected of them and how they're doing – and they demand to be rewarded or punished accordingly. If you keep them out of the loop, they'll feel a lack of direction and purpose that will likely reflect in their work (or lack thereof).


When someone does well, it's not only important to tell them, but to tell the entire team. Millennials tend to develop close relationships, and if Kristie got promoted over Louis, then the team will want to know why. Be explicit. Let them know exactly why golden-boy Louis got passed up by Kristie, and how others could follow her example.
Rewards and punishments go a long way with Millennials. It not only makes their performance clear, but it validates how they feel about their work. But when it comes to punishments, just be sure to state your logic as clearly as possible.

, Since childhood, this generation has been asked their opinion and been forced to make their own decisions. They've been treated as adults, by and large. Because of this, they view themselves as having something to offer the organization; it's not just them needing a job. If you treat them like they matter, they'll be happy to stay on.


Include Millennials in discussions about work tasks. Encourage them to contribute opinions and ideas. Resist the urge to treat Millennials like children, especially if your own children are around the same age.
Ask Millennial co-workers for their input on how to improve technology in the workplace. They are often on the cusp of what's new and up-and-coming.

, Millennials have skills. They have value and can get the work done. Because of this, they believe their work should reflect their value, too. Whenever possible, give them work that has a purpose. They'll do it better because they believe in it.


However, we all know that mundane, trivial work sometimes has to be done. When this is the case, explain to them how it has to be done for the larger benefit of the company. This has its own purpose and meaning and can help them see that even the smallest tasks have value.
Once you have assigned a task, allow Millennials to work independently, but keep the door open for them to ask questions.

, Generations ago, work was just work. You came home to your family and that was your life. Nowadays, not so much – work is life. When these kids go to a party, they are defined by their job. Their title is everything. Their work determines their happiness, not always the other way around.


Everyone is motivated by different things. Some employees will go ga-ga over a health food cafeteria while others just want to work autonomously. If you develop closer relationships with them, you'll be able to get at what they want out of their work (which is their life).
Make an effort to get to know your Gen-Y co-workers to discover what their goals are and the role they wish to play in the workplace. Be open to ideas presented by Millennials even if they differ from traditional business practices.

, Millennials were taught to speak up, raise their voice, and say something if they were unhappy or if something needed changing.They have an audacity that previous generations often didn't have, especially in the work place. So when meetings roll around, get their opinions. They have important things to add.


Not all their ideas will be conventional, but consider that a good thing. They often have new-fangled ideas that wouldn't occur to older generations. They know technology like the back of their hand and can be quick to offer ideas that can actually improve the company., Millennials are looking for personal, meaningful relationships. This goes for their boss, their coworkers, and even their own relationship with their work. If you're a mentor, you can help them feel valuable and get them pointed in the right direction. They're still young and malleable; you could help mold them into something impressive.


Model professional workplace behavior and expectations by demonstrating the way a task should be executed in great detail. Since many Millennials don't have real world work experience, offer your Gen-Y co-workers resources that will help them to complete assigned tasks.

, Be optimistic and provide Millennials with regular constructive feedback. Avoid being confrontational with this age group; they won't respond well. Since they're equals, they want to be spoken to with respect, regardless of the subject matter.


Be open and honest when communicating with Millennials. This group has been found to be responsive to transparency.However, criticism is best given constructively. Try to stay positive while remaining truthful.

, In increasing numbers, Millennials aren't looking for fat paychecks.While they do demand an amount higher than their parents, they're largely looking for adventure and fulfillment.


Offer them a chance to come on the company trip overseas. Bring a breakfast bar into the meeting room. Start a charity foundation they can help out with. Give them the chance to work in a satellite office somewhere else for a few weeks. Think outside of the norm, giving something that can spice up work.

, Google lets employees devote one day a week to their own side projects. Disney has a similar venture where employees are given time to work on ""Happiness Projects.""Millennials are the ones crafting the future, so you may need to allow them time to do so. After all, work is their life.


And their work is their brand. Their brand is them. Demanding that they devote 110% to your organization may not happen. However, there is an upside to this: there's no line between home and work. When they're working, it could be at 9 PM on a Saturday. They increasingly expect a 24/7 gig.

, Millennials are not looking for four gray walls to be locked into from 9-5. They're looking for work that is fun and exciting. While you may not be able to offer them safaris in Africa, you can offer little additions that keep them going.


Encourage Millennials to participate in staff activities inside and outside of the workplace. Office parties or volunteer opportunities will allow Millennials to have collaborative interactions and to learn from mature co-workers.
Have certain days where employees dress up, where you have a giant pizza party, or where meetings are conducted outside in picnic-format. Bring a ping-pong table into the conference room. Have a refrigerator dedicated entirely to string cheese. Even the smallest additions like bringing donuts in the morning can spark morale.

, ""Kids these days"" has been an expression for thousands of years. It's in the Bible and it's in ancient Greek literature.When you were their age, your superiors were saying the same thing about you. So meet them halfway, because it's partly the outlook of the older generation, too.


When you were their age, you likely didn't want to be contained either. You wanted adventure. You wanted things your parents didn't have. You had all these ideas that you were just hoping someone would ask to hear. As we age, these desires change. To work with Millennials, realize in part that it's just a shift that happens with time.

Prioritize emails from overseas workers so that you know to get to them more quickly, and you will be rewarded with a more efficient working relationship.

, Sarcasm is notoriously hard to convey via email. Rethink your phrasing to overseas workers more than you would to your office mates, because you'll have a harder time working through a miscommunication remotely.


Sense of humor is highly subjective. If the overseas workers are of a different nationality, you should not assume that they understand your sense of humor, especially by email. Try to control the amount of idiomatic phrases you use.

, Both Windows and Apple computers have applications that allow you to set a foreign time. Keeping it on your desktop for easy reference will help you to manage work with overseas workers or clients.


On Windows 7 operating system (OS) or above, go to your control panel. Select the ""Desktop Gadgets"" option. Select the clock. Hover over the clock on your desktop. When a small wrench appears, click it to change your clock options. Set the clock's time to your overseas worker's time.

, Working with people overseas may seem daunting, but it also gives you the opportunity to learn about a new person and country. Deal with creative and cultural differences as they come up, instead of ignoring them.

, Consult your manager about the productivity of the work and any changes you'd like to make.

, To start with, many people are uncomfortable with this, but after a few weeks, this can become very natural and keep you connected, build relationships and greatly improve business by enabling collaborative meetings wherever you are located, in an instant.

Obtain a certificate or degree, if desired.,
Join an engineering organization.,
Look for an internship.,
Volunteer your services.,
Consider working as a runner.,
Create a resume and cover letter.",How to Work at a Recording Studio2," A degree is not always a requirement; you may choose to go the apprenticeship route instead. However, obtaining a degree shows your ability to meet challenges and follow through, and gives you some experience in sound engineering. Try looking at trade schools specifically in the music industry.For example, you may want to obtain an Audio Production degree or a Recording Arts Bachelor of Science degree from a university. Alternately, you may obtain a certificate in Audio Recording and Production from a technical school.
Some schools offer job placement upon completion of a program.
Even if you obtain a certificate or degree, you’ll probably still need to start working at a low position.

, Gain networking and education opportunities by becoming a member. Attend meetings and offer your assistance.For example, you may want to join the Audio Engineering Society (AES), and/or The Society of Professional Audio Recording Services (SPARS).

, Be aware that you may be doing menial tasks, such as making coffee, preparing food or sweeping. Look for an internship that’s more than just a few hours a day.If the internship is just three to four hours a day, you’re less likely to get valuable on-the-job training.
Not all internships are paid. However, an internship position may help you to secure a paid position as an assistant or runner down the line.

, Look for music awards shows or tech expos that accept volunteers. Check with local churches and audio/technical organizations that accept volunteers. Let people know that you’re looking for an entry level position, and offer your information., This can get your foot in the door so you can work your way up to becoming an assistant engineer, and eventually an engineer.Runner is the lowest position for an engineer. You’ll perform basic tasks, such as preparing lunch, to help out while you’re still learning., A good cover letter is essential. Check your resume and cover letter thoroughly for spelling and grammar.Include the appropriate framework in your resume.For example, include your contact information, work experience, accomplishments, skills and education.
Try looking at some examples online of engineering resumes to get an idea of how to add detail to the focus of your resume.

Learn and share generously.",How to Work at a Recording Studio3," Try to limit chatting to asking important questions that will help you understand your tasks. Observe how your mentors are doing their jobs, particularly the recording engineer, record producer, and mastering engineer., Keep track of what sounds and techniques you use by writing them down. Refer back to your notes, for example when someone asks how you produced a specific recording.Being thorough and paying attention to detail is an important part of working at a recording studio., Great sound engineers tend to be people pleasers. Techniques evolve and change, so you’ll also need to be a lifetime learner. Share what you learn with your peers willingly, when asked.These characteristics are shared by highly successful mixing engineers.

Research local or state Renaissance festivals.,
Attend the pre-fair all-purpose orientation.,
Find the Renaissance festival job posting board after the orientation.",How to Work at a Renaissance Faire1," Do you already have a Renaissance festival that you would like to join in mind, or do you need to do some research? Once you decide that you want to work at a Renaissance fair it’s important to start researching potential festivals to work at early and often. Many Renaissance festivals do their hiring way ahead of time, so you need to make sure you start looking at least six to eight months before the festival.Start by doing an internet search for local or state Renaissance fairs. Navigate to their website and look for potential employment opportunities. A lot of them will allow you to apply for certain entry-level jobs directly from the website. However, it’s a good idea to attend the festival orientation before you apply.;
, This is the first step that you need to take once you find your festival. The orientation will allow you to get your foot in the door, potentially make some connections, and start to figure out what you may be suited for.


At the orientation, you will discover what employment opportunities are available and you’ll be given an overview of the Renaissance festival. This is a great way to gauge if you really want to be employed at a Renaissance festival. If so, you need to figure out what type of work you should be doing.
The pre-faire presentation will include a description of job requirements, such as costumes and language, as well as a list of guilds. Guilds generally audition people and may require more specific costumes and dialogue. , If you don't know where the job board is located, ask one of the facilitators at the orientation for directions.


The orientation will help you understand the details of each job, so you’ll be able to make an informed decision. Apply for a job you think you’ll be good at and enjoy.

Sign up for an entry-level job.,
Sign up for a guild.,
Consider being an artisan.,
Find week work.,
Go to the audition or interview.",How to Work at a Renaissance Faire2," You could work at a concession booth, games and rides, or in the kitchen. Concession booths are owned and operated by the booth owner, sometimes independently of the festival. You will need to find the owner and fill out an application. When you look for a job at a Renaissance fair, you may fill out more than 1 application to ensure you obtain employment.


Working for concessions may require you to have previous customer service experience. You’ll also be dealing with crowds and money all day, so you should be asked to perform well in a high pressure environment.
Most entry level jobs will pay an hourly wage.

, If you have acting talent, you may want employment as a performing artist. If you are a musician, sign up for the music guild, and if you are a dancer, sign up for the dance guild. Other guilds may include the Irish guild, the peasant guild, or the court guild.

, If you currently woodwork as a hobby, you might be able to turn that into a full time profession. Leather working, clothing design, glass blowing, and welding are all potential craft careersthat you could get into at a Renaissance fair. You’ll need to prove that you’re capable and produce some of your own work to show them.


The upside to being an artisan is that you are your own boss and you can work your own hours, sell your crafts to people at the fair, and enjoy your hobby while making money. The downside is that your costs will be high and you have no safety net. If no one buys anything that you’re selling, you’ll be stuck. There is no hourly wage for artisans., Even if you don’t land any of the jobs that you applied for you still may be able to find some work if you go to the fair and make connections. Talk to artisans that you would like to work with and see if they’ll pay you a small sum to help out through the course of the festival. It isn’t hard to find work if you are industrious.You can also do basic work like bookkeeping or security. , When working at a Renaissance trade fair you may have to audition for a part.Make sure you have prepared a bit that shows you are a good fit for the role you are applying for. You may sign up with as many guilds as you are interested in, but you need to make sure that the audition times don't overlap. You aren’t guaranteed to get an audition.


Similarly, you may get an interview to work for an entry-level job in the kitchen, for games and rides, or cleaning. If that’s the case you should bring a resume that shows you have the skills to work that job.

"
Determine what workshops you need to go to.,
Take the language workshop.,
Go to the costume workshop.Dress during the Renaissance time period reflected the status of the individual.,
Get your costume approved.",How to Work at a Renaissance Faire3," Generally, all new Renaissance festival employees will be required to attend a language and costume workshop, while guild employees may be required to participate in other workshops, such as ""Songs of the Times,"" ""Beginning Acting,"" or ""Meet and Greet.""

, When working at a Renaissance trade fair, you need to learn basic Elizabethan speech. Generally, all employees are required to learn Elizabethan speech. Even if you are working with the kitchen staff there is a chance that you may interact with someone visiting the fair. In that situation you need to be able to speak in an Elizabethan dialect.


Elizabethan English is the type of English that was spoken during the Elizabethan time period. This is the type of English that Shakespeare used. There are 24 letters versus the modern 26.

, For instance, a peasant would dress differently than a noble person. When you have a job at a Renaissance fair, you must dress according to the part you play. Once again, even if you are working in the kitchen staff you need to wear period appropriate clothing on the way to and from your post.

, At most Renaissance fairs you need to provide your own costume. Before you begin your job at a Renaissance fair, you must have your costume inspected by your employer. They will determine if it is an appropriate outfit for you to wear given your position.


If your employer does not approve your costume make sure you ask for helpful advice. They should give it to you unprompted. However, make sure the instructions are very clear so that you are prepared next time.

Plan for outside contributors to a conference program or other project.,
Identify your audience for the invitations.,
Consider your potential contributors needs.,
Outline a first draft.,
Have draft reviewed by others before sending it out.,
Post it on your website.,
Test the submission process.,
Draft the email introduction to the Call.,
Send it out to your target audience.,
Schedule a second time for re-sending it, and potentially a third if the submissions you are receiving are not sufficient.

,
Have a plan in place for reviewing submissions and methods for responding to each submitter.

",How to Write a Call for Participation," The call for participation in many ways acts as a blueprint. In conferences, the call cannot be sent out without having a plan for the schedule. Planning should include clear definitions of what types of sessions will be offered, for how long, on which days.;
, Identifying the people from whom you want contributions is also fundamental in the process, and helps guide the style of writing. You can brainstorm lists of possibilities, from general categories (eg, researchers in positive psychology) to specifics (eg, specific people you have contact information for).

, Brainstorm based on what you know about those who you'll be inviting to contribute. To help motivate them to take the time to submit a proposal, they need to see the benefit they could get. For example, in academia, conference presentations and publications are important in building credibility and often required in tenure decisions so many proposals come with hopes of being able to add the work done to a CV.

, The sections common to Calls for Participation include:


Title (including ""Call for Participation to ___""), and location and dates of the main event, and deadlines for submission of proposals, including the time of day. This makes it possible for people to quickly evaluate whether they can make the commitment to the event and to the time involved in submitting the proposal.
Introductory text - phrased to capture your readers' interest, referencing issues they care about, with an overview of the event or project - setting expectations for what they could apply to be part of.
Description of types of proposals sought - including content and format. For a conference this would include descriptions of session formats and what is expected for each (eg, talks, demonstrations, interactive workshops, posters), including the length of time a presenter would be expected to work with.
A checklist of steps for submitting a proposal, including a basic list of the elements that are needed, including word counts per section. This should include the deadlines (again), the related links to more detailed information and online submission forms.
Criteria for acceptance - beyond complying with the basics of the proposal format, what elements would the best proposals be expected to include. This acts as a guide or rubric for the proposal writers.
Relevant links to FAQs, past events and contact information in case someone has questions.

, All too frequently, calls for participation can be confusing or easily misinterpreted. Asking someone familiar with the project and audience to review it will improve the clarity and quality of what you send out, and reduce the likelihood of having to revise and resend it.

, Right before you send out the Call for Participation, it's good to make sure it is easy to find online

, Make sure you could complete the steps and that all relevant links and forms work as you'd planned.

, Before people read the call, whether it comes within an email or as an attachment, you'll need a good subject line and opening within the email in order to get their attention. Include date information as early as possible - this helps them more quickly decide whether the email is something they want to look at more closely. Also request that they forward it to appropriate colleagues.

, In any mass mailing you can expect some ""bounce backs"" from bad email addresses and anti-spam auto-responders. Determine how much time you want to spend reviewing and addressing those.

Qualify for an H-1B visa.,
Ask your US employer to apply for the visa for you.,
Supply the necessary documents for the application.,
Discuss the payment of the application fee with your employer.,
File the application by April 1st of the year you would like to work in the U.S.,
Re apply for the visa after one year working in the U.S.",How to Work in the USA as a Canadian Citizen1," This type of visa is much sought after as it can be issued for full time or part time employment for individuals who possess a “specialty occupation”. A specialty occupation is a role that requires the skills of a professional. You should have at least a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent, or relevant work experience. In addition, the process can be complicated and you may need an attorney to navigate the process. Accountants, computer analysts, web programmers, web designers, and engineers can all quality for an H-1B visa. U.S. Congress allots 65,000 H-1B visas a year for specialty professionals who receive job offers from U.S. companies or organizations.
There are also 20,000 H-1B visas for individuals with advanced degrees, such as M.D., J.D., MBA, and Ph.D. If you are a Canadian with a medical degree, a law degree, or another graduate degree, you may be eligible for one of the 20,000 H-1B visas. This gives you a leg up, as you will not be put into the general pool of applicants, competing for one of 65,000 visas.
If you are a Canadian fashion model, you can also work in the U.S. on an H-1B visa. As a fashion model, you do not need to have a bachelor’s degree, but you need to demonstrate “distinguished merit or ability”. You will need to be nationally or internationally known and have achieved a high level of recognition or achievement in the fashion modeling industry.If you are a Canadian owner of a U.S. company, you can sponsor yourself for a H-1B visa if you have a bachelor’s degree or higher in a specialized field. For example, a Canadian with a law degree who founded a U.S. specialty law firm can then sponsor herself for an H-1B and work as a lawyer at her own company.;
, Once you receive a job offer from a U.S. employer, your employer will apply for the H-1B visa on your behalf. The employer will be the legal petitioner and you, as the employee, will be the beneficiary.Your employer will file a Labor Condition Application (LCA) with the U.S. Department of Labor. The LCA determines how much you are going to be paid, based on the minimum salary or wage for Canadians working in the U.S.
Once your employer receives a certified LCA, she will complete a Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker form to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). Your employer will send in the completed petition, as well as the certified LCA and any necessary fees and documents to the USCIS for processing.

, You will need to provide official documentation to your U.S. employer to process the application. Your employer will also need to provide detailed information about your position at the company in the application. The necessary documents you will need to provide include:Sponsorship/job offer from the employer
Copy of your current resume
Copy of your Canadian passport
Copies of your degrees, certificates, transcripts (if applicable)
Employment reference letters from previous employers (if applicable)
Copy of any professional development course certificates (if applicable)
Professional license (if applicable)
If you already live in the U.S., you can provide the following documentation:
Copy of your US social security number, if you have one
Copy of the front and back of the I-94 card
Copies of any prior H1B approval notices of J1 forms
If you are changing employers and are currently on H1B status, or are applying for an extension of stay with the same employer, provide a copy of your most recent pay stubs or a letter from your current employer verifying your employment.

, Most U.S. employers will pay the application fee and the fee for the visa. However, you should discuss the payment of the fees before you complete the application., It usually takes two months for the application process to go through. So to ensure you are set to work in the U.S. for the fiscal year, your employer should file the application by April 1st. The earliest start date for an employee with an H-1B visa is October 1st of that fiscal year, or six months from the start of the fiscal year.If you would like to start working for your employer before October 1st, you should talk to your employer about applying for other visas, like the TN1, to fill the time gap.

, The H-1B visa is valid for up to three years, and can be renewed for another three years. You must leave after six years in the United States for one year but after one year you can re-apply for a new H-1B.This visa is also unique in that it allows for “dual intent”, which means you can apply for permanent residency status while on the visa. Other work visas, like TN1, do not permit dual intent. If you apply for an employment based green card while you have a H-1B visa, you can extend the visa indefinitely.

Determine whether you meet the basic requirements.,
Ask about the work visa requirements.,
Get the necessary immunizations.,
Find specialized training courses.,
Complete the required certifications.,
Decide if you are capable of working long shifts.,
Prepare for the physical labor aspects of the job.,
Research the weather conditions at your possible oil rig job.,
Decide if you can manage the aspects of physical danger.,
Consider your qualifications.,
Weigh your personal skills and preferences.,
Choose an entry level position that suits you, if necessary.",How to Work on an Oil Rig," While entry-level jobs on oil rigs are plentiful and technically don't require any experience, few companies will hire a ""green hand"" to work on their billion-dollar platforms.


In general, oil rig workers only need to be 18 or older, have a high school diploma, and pass a pre-employment drug test. Successful applicants have usually pursued oil rig training independently or bring transferable skills to the job. All workers must meet certain minimum standards and certifications to work on an oil rig.;
, Since many oil rigs are in international waters or even in foreign countries, it is important to be aware of what documents you’ll need if you must enter another country for the work. Most companies will arrange for a current work visa for people working outside their native country.

, Oil rig jobs are available in some of the world's most exotic locations, including the coasts of Africa and the waters of Southeast Asia. Workers from other regions often get jobs in these areas, but they must complete a full course of immunizations before they will be hired.


Some of the most common required vaccinations include Hepatitis A; Hepatitis B; Tetanus; Polio; Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR); Meningitis; Typhoid Fever; Seasonal Influenza; and Yellow Fever., Many trade schools and colleges offer classes on various facets of the oil industry, including oil rig work. Most classes blend coursework with hands-on field experience. Companies often provide training for workers looking to advance their careers in specialized fields., All offshore workers are required to earn an Offshore Survival & Firefighting certificate. Specialized workers like electricians, scaffolders, and welders must hold a state-issued license or certificate in order to work on a rig., Most oil rig crews, both onshore and offshore, work grueling 12-hour shifts. Rotations vary, but most companies keep crews on site for two weeks and then give workers two weeks off. , Entry-level oil rig jobs are physically taxing. Most involve moving supplies and heavy equipment, like drill pipes. This kind of work requires a level of strength and endurance that other jobs might not., Oil rigs are often located in places with extreme weather conditions. Offshore and onshore rigs offer distinct challenges.



Onshore rigs. Most oilfields in the United States are in the unforgiving climate of the Southwest, where summertime temperatures regularly exceed 100 degrees F (37.7 C). Drilling in the petroleum-rich fields of Canada reaches full capacity during the bitterly cold winter months, when the frozen ground is better able to withstand heavy equipment and exploration procedures.

Offshore rigs. Workers on offshore oil rigs are at the mercy of the elements, too. North Sea platforms are battered year-round by strong winds and unyielding waves. Rigs dotting the U.S. coastline in the Gulf of Mexico are on alert during the hurricane season (June 1 to November 30).

, The contents of an oil well are under extreme pressure, but that's only part of the danger rig workers face daily. Cranes are constantly moving massive sections of pipe across the platform. Highly combustible gases are used in everyday operations that include welding and pipe-cutting. All of these aspects of oil rigs constitute a fairly constant level of danger that requires workers to be on guard and prepared to handle emergency situations.

, An oil rig is a place where you really can work hard to get ahead. Most crane operators, shift supervisors and other skilled workers started out in entry-level positions. They set themselves apart by pursuing advanced oil rig training and accepting additional assignments. If you have previous experience, advanced qualifications or training, etc., you may be able to apply for non-entry level positions.


If working on an oil rig is a long-term goal of yours or if you want to begin working at the highest level possible, it might be a good idea for you to pursue training options and certifications before you apply so that you are more qualified for non-entry level positions.

, There are a variety of jobs available for employment on oil rigs. Think about what kind of work you enjoy doing and what job might best fit with these ideas.


If you enjoy cooking more than manual labor, consider applying to be a chef for the oil rig crew. If you want to learn a specific trade (like welding), you might want to apply to be a helper or apprentice to a welder or other specialist on the oil rig.

, There are many jobs available for inexperienced workers to begin their careers.Roughneck: Roughnecks are general laborers who usually work on the rig deck. They move equipment and supplies, and also are responsible for cleaning equipment and work areas.Roustabout: These workers are involved in drilling operations. They often move sections of drill pipe and clean spill. Roustabouts aspire to one day become the tool pusher, the senior supervisor on a rig.Helper: Helpers assist skilled personnel, serving as apprentices for rig electricians, lead welders, and heavy-equipment operators.Painter: Offshore oil rigs, in particular, must be painted constantly to protect the structure from the corrosive effects of saltwater. This is a hazardous duty, as painters often must be suspended in harnesses to reach remote areas of the platform.

Motorman: Motormen maintain and repair all rig machinery, including generators and deck equipment. Deckhand: Deckhands build tow lines to secure barges and boats to the structure, facilitating loading and offloading of cargo.

Steward: Housekeeping needs, including laundry service and janitorial duties, must be met to ensure the smooth operation of an oil rig.

Assistant chef: Galley hands, including assistant chefs, work around the clock to prepare meals for all shifts. This is a job where mainstream experience is directly transferable to duties on the rig.

Be physically fit.,
Be prepared to be at sea for an extended period of time.,
Get a passport.,
Understand the roles on the ship.,
Decide which entry-level job is right for you.",How to Work on a Container Ship1," Jobs on container ships are extremely physically demanding, so you must be prepared to be on your feet for long hours, lift and carry heavy items, and perform various other physical tasks, depending on the kind of job you accept.;
, In addition to being physically strong, you should be mentally prepared to work long hours, spend most of your time in confined quarters with the other crew members, and be away from your family for weeks or even months at a time.


You may end up at sea for longer than expected if there is bad weather, a mechanical problem, or even a strike at one of your ports.

, A job on a container ship will likely require you to travel all over the world. It's best to have your passport well in advance of your job search so you don't have to worry about it.

, Most jobs on a container ship fall into three departments: the engine room, the deck, and the galley. Crewmen in the engine department are responsible for repairing and maintaining all mechanical and electrical components of the ship. Crewmen on the deck are responsible for navigation, security, and maintenance, depending on their rank. Crewmen in the galley are responsible for preparing and serving meals and cleaning.


If you have experience as a cook, engineer, mechanic, firefighter, nurse, or doctor, you may be able to transition into the maritime industry without first performing entry-level jobs.

, If you don't have any experience working at sea or any special training, you will need to start your career in an entry-level position. All of these positions offer the opportunity to advance to higher level positions once you have the appropriate level of experience. Some of the most common entry-level container-ship jobs include:Ordinary seaman (OS): This is an entry-level deck job. An OS will learn fundamental seamanship during a specified training period. Ordinary seamen will grease lashing gear, chip rust, and paint fixtures. As they gain experience, new deckhands are given additional responsibilities. Eventually, an OS can expect to be designated as an Able Bodied Seaman, or AB. AB duties include lookout watches, handling tow lines, and making security rounds.
Wiper: New engine room personnel start as wipers and perform a wide range of functions, including basic maintenance, cleaning, and inventory. A wiper usually moves into a position as a qualified man of the engine department, or QMED. QMEDs perform a range of functions, including maintaining and repairing the engine and auxiliary-power systems.
Steward utility: New galley hands start their maritime careers in utility roles, which include dish washing, laundry, and housekeeping. These crewmen often later become stewards, which involves helping with meal preparation and supervising other galley personnel.

Qualify for a TN1 visa.,
Understand the advantages and disadvantages of the TN1 visa.,
Apply for the visa in person at the border for a lower fee and faster processing.,
Discuss applying for the TN1 visa through USCIS with your employer.,
Ask your employer about the payment of the application fee.",How to Work in the USA as a Canadian Citizen2," The TN1 visa is modeled after the H1B visa, so it can only be used when your employer is based in the US. Though the application process is simplified with the TN1 visa, you must work in a specified profession that qualifies you for a TN1 visa. Accountants, architects, graphic designers, urban planners, medical professionals, and scientific professionals with bachelor degrees or higher education are all considered valid professions for this visa. A list of professions covered by NAFTA can be found here.


The TN1 is only granted to employers, and if you need a visa for more than one employer, you will need to file multiple visa applications. If you are self-employed, you will not qualify for this visa category., TN1 visas are valid for three years and are often more likely to be approved than an H-1B visa. The application period for a TN1 visa can also be fast tracked by applying for the visa at the US border. But TN1 visas also have several potential disadvantages, including:This visa is given to individuals with specialized skills and you may not qualify for the visa because your profession is not recognized by NAFTA as “specialized”.
Under this visa, you must demonstrate your intention to return to Canada once the TN1 visa expires. For your first TN1 visa, you likely do not have to demonstrate your intention to return when you reapply. But if you have been on the TN1 visa for six to nine years, and are seeking another three year visa, you may be required to show you still intend to return to Canada at some point. You will need to provide documents showing you still maintain ties to Canada, such as bank account statements, a provincial driver’s license, real estate ownership, or having a spouse or other family living in Canada.
With a TN1 visa, it is also more difficult to apply for an employment-based green card. There is no “dual intent” allowed with this visa and you must always demonstrate an “intent to return”. If you apply for a U.S. green card while you have a TN1 visa, this could be seen as a violation of your visa agreement and you may lose your visa.

, The application fee at the border is significantly lower than applying through the USCIS, and the decision to grant or deny the visa is made on the spot at the border. If you are denied the visa, you will learn the reason for the denial right away and attempt to correct it as soon as possible. You will need to carry the following documents with you to the U.S. border to apply for the TN1 visa:A description of your position with a US employer. It should include a description of why it is a professional occupation, recognized by NAFTA, and that the position is temporary. It should also confirm you are a direct employee and note your salary level.
Proof of your qualifications, such as a copy of your degree, certificate, or transcripts
A copy of your current resume
A copy of your Canadian passport
A copy of your social security number, if applicable
A copy of your employment contract
Details of your foreign address or place of residence

, A TN1 visa application done through the USCIS will take at least two months to process, the fee is much higher and if you are denied, it will take more time and money to re apply via the USCIS. Talk with your U.S. employer about applying for the visa at the border, rather than the USCIS. If your employer insists on applying for the visa through the USCIS, you will need to supply the following documentation:


Sponsorship/job offer from the employer
A copy of your current resume
Copy of your Canadian passport
Copies of your degrees, certificates, transcripts (if applicable)
Employment reference letters from previous employers (if applicable)
Copy of any professional development course certificates (if applicable)
Professional license (if applicable)
If you already live in the U.S., you can provide the following documentation:
Copy of your US social security number, if you have one
Copy of the front and back of the I-94 card

, Most U.S. employers will pay the application fee and the fee for the visa. However, you should discuss the payment of the fees before you complete the application."

Think about the future.,
Set clear goals.,
Determine strategic actions needed to reach your goals.,
Prioritize your goals.,
Take time to reflect.,
Consider all variables.,
Create a plan.,
Put your plan on paper.,
Put your plan into action.,
Evaluate your progress.,
Make necessary adjustments.",How to Work Strategically," Look beyond the immediate and into the future in order to get a clear vision of where you see yourself in the future. Make sure that your plan for the day lines up with your short-term and long-term goals for your company.Strategic working doesn’t have to involve outlandish and complex plans. The most important thing to do is to simply connect your thoughts to outcomes in your work.Try to schedule regular brainstorming sessions with yourself and your colleagues. Put some ideas down on paper to help capture your thoughts.;
, Think about what you want to accomplish in your work in the future, both long-term and short-term. These goals should be specific to your future vision. In addition, they should be measurable and time-specific.


For example, if you envision enlarging your small, local delivery business, then you may set a specific goal of expanding your delivery area into three more counties, owning a large fleet of delivery trucks, having 200 employees, and/or running a shipping/packing warehouse.

, Gather all of the data you need to determine what it will take to accomplish your goals. Each goal could have numerous strategies that will achieve the goal but with different costs, schedules, and resources. You should consider strategic elements like what materials you will need and how much time you think it will take to achieve these goals.For example, if your goal involves expanding your delivery business, you should consider how much it will cost to purchase more delivery vehicles, how you might increase your marketing to expand into new areas, and how much time/money it will take to do accomplish these things.

, Write each goal out, including the method(s) you will use toward accomplishment, costs, resource requirements, delegation of responsibilities, and the time it will take to achieve the goal.Consider which goals you will need to address first – which are more important, or which might need to be accomplished before others can be tackled.
Consider immediacy, importance, and ease of execution. Some goals may be very important to your future vision, but may not be immediate, as they will take the most time and money to execute – while other goals may be less vital, but immediately and easily executable.
For example, if you want to expand your delivery business, it might benefit you to start slowly expanding your marketing outreach in small, easily-achievable ways (like by distributing fliers) before you start acquiring additional delivery vehicles. It’s true that you’ll need more delivery vehicles if your market expands, but purchasing cars is a big investment to make before the need is confirmed.

, Each day, try to take a few moments to reflect on what you’ve accomplished and how your accomplishments align with your goals, even if it is just for a few minutes. In today’s fast-paced world, people often forget to stop and think about what they’ve learned because they’re too busy moving on to the next step.Think about your work each day and what you learned from it.

, The base word in strategic thinking (or working) is “strategy.” This means that when you are creating your plan, you need to carefully consider all variables that could possibly affect your work.Think about things like outside disturbances, financial setbacks, unexpected costs, etc.
For the delivery truck example, you would need to consider the price of gasoline for the additional vehicles, the cost of insurance for the new drivers, what might happen if there is an accident in one of the delivery vehicles, the cost of additional advertising in the new market, etc.

, Once you identify, organize, and prioritize your goals, outline the strategic work steps you will take towards those goals in chronological format. Following a carefully constructed order of operations is necessary to working strategically. For each of your goals, you need to define a series of actionable steps that will lead to achieving that goal, taking all of the information you gathered into account. Create a plan in the following way:


For example, if you want to expand your delivery service by purchasing new vehicles, you will need to craft a strategy to come up with the extra capital needed to purchase them and increase your number of employees.

, Write your plan down so that there is a physical record and you can easily keep track of where you’re at in your plan at all moments. You may do this by hand, or you may implement any of a number of computer-based planning/time-management applications., Keeping your goals in mind and being conscientious of time constraints, follow the steps you outlined in your plan. Stick to your plan and try not to deviate without careful consideration. You spent a lot of time thinking about your goals and the future of your work, so remain confident in your plan.


Communicate your plan with your colleagues. Communication is crucial for any successful business strategy. Make sure your fellow coworkers are aware of your plans and goals so that they can be working with these things in mind as well.If possible, try to involve your colleagues in the planning stage so that they feel more engaged and personally invested in your company’s goals.

, Strategic work involves setting priorities so as to most efficiently accomplish tasks. Those priorities may shift regularly, due to a number of outside circumstances, and you need to be able to identify the shift so as to reallocate your resources accordingly. Consider the plan you originally laid out and how well you are meeting those goals.


If you find that you are not meeting your goals as well as you feel like you should, be open to the idea of tailoring your plan to whatever your current situation is.

, Determine if your goals are realistic to the time frame you have outlined. You may find that your plan is not resulting in timely results, or that you are accomplishing steps faster than you had expected. Either way, you should reframe your goals and/or plan so they are in line with reality.For example, if you unexpectedly find a fleet of trucks at a record-low clearance price, then it may be a good idea to make that purchase before investing in the previously high-priority piece of business property that will most likely stay on the market.

Find out the specific duties of the job offered.,
Get the initial offer in writing.,
Compare the initial offer to your ideal.,
Find out how the compensation was determined.,
Format your letter.,
Thank them for the offer.,
List the reasons you are worth more.,
Set out your terms.,
Ask for an appointment to negotiate.,
Send your letter to the hiring manager.,
Make an appointment.,
Find out how much leeway the hiring manager has.,
Assert your position.,
Listen to the response.,
Assess your options.",How to Write a Salary Negotiation Letter," You cannot adequately assess whether the initial offer is on part with what you would get from another company until you determine exactly what the responsibilities will be for the role you've been offered.Understanding what the job entails can also help you assess whether they've offered you an appropriate job title. While the job title may not matter all that much to you, it can put you in a better position to negotiate raises later on.
For example, if you notice that you will be supervising several employees according to the job description, and that people in similar positions in other departments have words like ""senior"" or ""supervisor"" in their job titles, you may want to negotiate a similar title for yourself.
Understanding specific duties also gives you the ability to compare the company's initial offer to offers by similar companies for similar positions. If the position is clearly entry-level, you would want to compare it to entry-level positions in similar companies.
However, if the job offered includes some supervisory or managerial functions, you may want to compare it to more high-ranking positions in your industry.
Keep in mind that here you're looking at what is offered for this job, not what you personally might be worth. If you are over-qualified for the job, you typically can't expect to be compensated for the degree to which your qualifications exceed those required for the position.
For example, if you have two years' experience in your field, but you are offered an entry-level position for someone with no experience, you may not be adequately compensated – at least initially – for the two years' experience you do have.;
, Once the recruiter or hiring manager presents you with an offer, ask for them to put it in writing. This not only allows you to evaluate the offer on your own time, but ensures they can't change the offer later.Even if you're happy with the initial offer, it's typically in your best interests to take it home and evaluate it outside the pressure of the interview setting.
Find out how long you have to consider the offer. Typically companies are just fine with giving you a few days, but you may encounter resistance if you need any longer than that.
Break the initial offer down into the base salary and any benefits offered. Assigning a monetary value to the other benefits offered can give you the overall compensation offered.
Take note of any benefits you don't care about, as you can use these as bargaining chips. For example, if the company has offered you a gym membership, but you already have a gym in the building where you live that is comparable to the membership, you may not want the membership. It would be more beneficial for you if the company placed that value elsewhere.
Fully research all aspects of the benefits offered and think about how they will work in your life. For example, if your family lives several states away and you try to visit them at least a couple times a year, paid vacation time may actually be more valuable to you than other benefits.

, You probably had some idea before you even applied with a company the amount of compensation and levels of benefits you'd prefer to receive. Look at the initial offer in light of what you want to see how it stacks up.Based on your assessment, come up with some options you feel comfortable presenting to the hiring manager to negotiate higher compensation.
If there are certain items, such as paid vacation or paid sick leave, that are more important to you than others, make a note of this and figure out what you'd be willing to give up to get what you wanted in those areas.
Keep in mind that you should be looking at base salary first. If the base salary isn't anywhere near what you expected, and the company is unable to meet your expectations, the company may not be right for you at this time.
Look for areas that are unaddressed in the offer where you might be able to negotiate greater value. For example, if taking the position would require you to move to another state, you may be able to negotiate some payment of relocation expenses.

, While it can be difficult to get full information, the better an idea you have of how the hiring manager decided specifically what to offer you, the more ability you have to negotiate better terms.When you receive the initial offer, ask the hiring manager or recruiter to explain how they arrived at that amount.
Typically you'll have more room to negotiate if the offer was calculated specifically for you, rather than simply being the same offer they make to all new hires.
The more information you can learn regarding how the initial offer was determined and who came up with it, the better you can find ways to negotiate higher value.

, Even if you're sending your letter using email, you want to use a formal business format and address your letter to a specific person – typically the person who presented the original offer, unless they've indicated you should direct correspondence to someone else.If you're addressing the letter to someone other than the person who presented you with the initial offer – say, because your initial offer was provided by a recruiter or other interviewer on behalf of the person who will actually be doing the hiring – mention the person with whom you spoke by name.
Generally, your text should be single-spaced, with a double-space between paragraphs.
When you're ready to sign off, use your full name and a closing such as ""thank you."" You may want to include your phone number under your name if you're not printing the letter on letterhead or sending it from an email address that has a signature line that includes contact information.
If you're sending your letter using email, make sure you're using an appropriate email address. If you have a cutesy email address that you use for personal communication, set up another one with a free provider that you can use for more serious, business communications.

, Begin your letter by thanking the person for the initial offer, and be specific. Include the title of the position and location where you will be working. You might also want to mention job responsibilities if they bear relevance to skills or experience you intend to highlight.For example, if you were offered a position in the company's offices in New York City, but you live in Chicago, you probably should include the location when you thank them for the offer, especially if you plan to ask them to cover some of your relocation expenses.
If the job title is at issue, make sure you list the job title you were offered exactly, so you can ask for it to be changed.
Close this first paragraph with a statement that you are excited about working for the company and believe you could contribute a lot, or provide significant value.

, Highlight points on your resumé that show you have experience or education that should command a higher salary or greater benefits. Here you can use the knowledge you gleaned about how your offer was determined, and bring up or expand on aspects of your background they may not have taken into consideration.For example, if you know that the offer you received is the same offer the company gives all new hires, you can point out the additional value you bring to the position, or the experience you have that many other new hires may not.
You also have the opportunity to include information you may not have noted on your resumé, or to expand on the brief descriptions of your experience that you already gave them.
To this end, you may want to think about what hypothetical person they have in mind who is worth that initial offer. Then you can explain how you are worth more than that hypothetical person.
Try to keep this paragraph brief, but focus on specific examples that demonstrate you are worth more than the compensation in the initial offer.
If what you want is less about getting more money and more about something such as a change in job title, provide reasons for your request based on what you know about the job responsibilities of the position they've offered you.
If you're asking for the company to help cover relocation expenses because you have to move to accept the position, keep in mind that they may decide they could simply hire someone who already lived in the area. You want to show that you have unique value to add and that they won't find anyone comparable to you for less.

, Based on the reasons you've described, state a specific salary you want, including additional benefits or other options. While you don't want to ask for an amount that's too high, you still want to leave room to negotiate.If you're willing to exchange certain benefits for others, state this clearly. For example, if you have no need for the reserved parking spot because you don't have a car, but would like a week more of paid vacation time than was initially offered, you might present this exchange.
Be careful not to state your terms as a demand, but as a counter-offer. Stress that you're open to discussion.
If you have other job offers from other companies, you might be able to mention these and use them as leverage.
However, don't make up offers that you don't have – you don't know who the hiring manager or others in the company know in the industry. If they are able to find out with a quick phone call that you never received such an offer, even your initial offer may evaporate.

, While you're setting the stage for salary negotiation through your letter, you ultimately want to sit down with the hiring manager and talk face to face rather than haggling through letters back and forth, which can be time-consuming and tedious.Asking for an appointment sends a message to the hiring manager that you value their time and aren't interested in drawing out the process.
If you have specific dates in mind, you may want to include them – particularly if a face-to-face meeting would require you to travel.
If you are looking at working for a company several states over, and would not be able to travel to them, you typically can set up a meeting over the phone or online.
You want to give your letter enough time to get there if you're mailing it, so don't pick dates too close to the date you're writing your letter. At the same time, you don't want to set them too far out – you want to strike while the iron is hot.
Generally, try to plan for a meeting within a week or two of the date you've sent your counter-offer, barring any holidays.

, Often sending your letter electronically will be preferable to using the mail, because you can avoid unnecessary delays. If you use email, make sure you have a direct email address for the hiring manager who presented the initial offer.Physical mail is fine, if a bit old-fashioned, but be wary of sending this letter over a fax. Faxes may be seen by many people in the office who have no business knowing the details of your salary negotiation.
Generally, you want to follow the method initially set by the company that extended the offer. If they communicated your initial offer to you using email, this is the best method to use to send your counter-offer.
If they mailed you a formal offer letter, responding by mailing a paper letter is the way to go, unless the letter with the initial offer indicated otherwise.
Regardless of which method you choose, your counter-offer should be in writing so you have a written record of the negotiations.

, While you want to set your appointment as soon as possible, you may want to give yourself a few days if you need to research the market or otherwise solidify your position before you talk to the hiring manager.Keep in mind that before your appointment, you may need to do some additional research on the market and on your value. While this shouldn't take more than a few hours, you don't want to show up for this appointment unprepared.
You also need to come up with a general range of compensation you'd be willing to accept, as well as some alternative arrangements in case certain aspects of your compensation, such as the base salary, are not negotiable.
Follow the hiring manager's lead in terms of where to have the meeting, if you're located in the same city or general area as the company and can easily travel there.
Generally speaking, it will be more convenient for them to hold the meeting in their office or in a company conference room, but they may offer to meet at a restaurant or café.

, One of the first things you should try to nail down when you start the conversation is just how much power the hiring manager has to set your compensation or offer you more benefits.For example, you might say something like ""Before we get into discussing the specifics, I'm curious just how much control you have over the terms of the offer.""
If they ask you what specific items you have in mind, feel free to tell them. Don't worry about aspects of the initial offer with which you're happy – you're only interested in negotiating about items that you think should be different.
Generally, the hiring manager or other person with whom you're meeting should let you know clearly if there's anything they have no power to change. They may be more reticent about things over which they do have direct authority.

, You should have several possibilities in mind that you would be willing to accept. Assuming the hiring manager rejects the terms you asserted in your letter, offer something a step closer to the initial offer and see what happens.Keep in mind that they want you – otherwise they wouldn't have extended the offer. And this person wouldn't be meeting with you if the terms of that offer weren't up for negotiation.
Have confidence in your skills and abilities, and continue to sell yourself and your expertise throughout this meeting.
Generally, you don't have to worry about losing the initial offer. This time before you accept that offer is when you potentially have the most bargaining power, because you are perceived as an asset the company wants to acquire.
If your first counter-offer is rejected, be ready to come down a little, but don't simply give up after the first rejection. It's likely the hiring manager will simply reassert the initial offer, or maybe move a little.
If the hiring manager isn't moving very much toward your position, you may want to try a different angle. Based on your research and your understanding of the initial offer, look at other areas where you can potentially increase compensation, such as negotiating for more paid vacation time or sick leave, or asking for a signing bonus.

, When the hiring manager talks, pay attention to what they're saying and try to figure out what it means for you. If the hiring manager has little control over the terms of your offer, maybe you can find out who does.The hiring manager's response will give you clues as to what they are able to do, as well as what they are willing to do for you personally.
You also may learn a little about how you are perceived by the company. You have significantly greater bargaining power with a company that really wants you, or that has been trying to fill this position for a relatively long time.

, At this point, what you decide to do depends largely on the hiring manager's response. If the hiring manager isn't willing or able to provide the salary and benefits you want, you have to consider whether you want to take the job at the terms offered or keep looking.Avoid agreeing to something less than what you expected with the idea that you'll just work there for a couple months and then move on to something else.
Unless you're currently unemployed and have no other options, it's not fair either to you or to the company to sign on with the idea that you're only there temporarily. If they wanted a temporary employee, they would have worked through a temp agency rather than offering a salary band benefits to you.
Even if you're not able to get what you want off the bat, find out what the possibilities are for raises or promotions – and get any promises made in writing.
If you and the hiring manager are able to come to an agreement, make sure you get that in writing as an amended offer. Once you sign off on that, you're hired and ready to start your new job.

Assess the communication environment.,
Consider how conflicts are addressed at work.,
Separate your personal feelings from professional assessments.,
Gauge your satisfaction on the job.",How to Work for Family," Identifying your role within the organization will help limit confusion and misunderstandings about your level of power and authority. You may be accustomed to managing the books at home, but your brother may consider himself the accounting expert of his business and expect you to oversee the sales department.;

, You may need to learn how to manage people, work with specialized software or create client relationships. Sign up for classes and seminars to strengthen your skills.

, Working for family may mean that you are salaried, paid hourly, or given a percentage of profits. Clarify the compensation amount, frequency and payroll date. If the family business can only pay you if and when there is a profit, be sure that you are okay with this before committing to the position.

, A heated conversation may be manageable for you at home, but it may not bring out the best in you in the work environment. Alternatively, you might appreciate the candid communication style of a family business.


Determine if you are productive in the existing communication dynamics. If not, ask if an objective third person can join important conversations. An objective non-family employee or an outside consultant may be able to detect when family members are tuning each other out or behaving irrationally.

, Not everyone has to agree on everything, and it's often better for brainstorming purposes when family members feel free to express diverse views. However, make sure that disagreements don't result in the stifling of your professional growth or an impasse in business processes.


Develop conflict resolutions skills. Listening carefully to family members in the workplace, speaking openly about obstacles that are interfering with work processes, and committing to creating win-win situations will help to diminish the negative impacts of conflicts in a family business.

, You may be in the position of working with a family member whom you do not respect on a personal level. Consciously focus on the professional strengths of that relative, who may be organized in the workplace, a good salesperson or contributing positively in some way to the bottom line of the business.

, Working for family may be a pleasant experience, enabling you to enjoy working daily with people you love. Contributing to the financial well-being of the family can be an empowering process.


Seek other professional options if necessary. If the family business doesn't allow room for professional growth due to unsolvable family conflicts, power attachments or the business structure, pursuing other professional opportunities may be the best way to simultaneously keep the family peace and fulfill your own professional needs.

Attend conferences. Attend meetings put on by the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, which is an advocacy group organized by a consortium of equity firms.
Join associations. There are a variety of associations, depending on your specialty and region that you could join and network through.
Attend functions, parties, or other gatherings. Once you’ve made a few contacts in private equity, they may invite you to more private functions or parties where you can meet other people.
Reach out to contacts from college, including professors and peers, as well as your school's employment services.

If a current employee or someone else recommended you contact the company, you should state that. You should have a letterhead that includes your name, so you may want to identify yourself by your skills.
In one to three sentences, you should list your education and relevant experience.
In a couple of sentences, you should discuss any thing that makes you an outstanding or unique potential employee. For example, if you’re a former lobbyist and have a lot of contacts in government, you should say so.
Wrap up the letter by stating what you can do for the private equity firm. Try to distinguish yourself and show vision and ambition.
End the letter by thanking them for their time and letting them know that you would love to talk further.
Sign the letter, instead of using a digital signature.
Tailor each letter to a specific job or company. Make sure to address important job related requirements and/or how you will fit into the company culture.

Don't feel as if you have to know everything.,
Do some research.,
Approach your boss.,
Send the details in an email.,
Be patient.",How to Request Training As a New Manager," Nobody knows everything and a person who professes that they do is somebody to be very wary of. New managers are expected to be ""wet-behind-the-ears"" and a new manager who has the ability to own up to knowledge gaps will be respected for honesty and for having the initiative to do something about it.;
, Find out about the existing training options before asking your boss. That way, you will be across the various courses, seminars, coaching opportunities, etc., that are available. In doing this, consider:


What in-house training exists or whether only external training can meet your needs (and why): It is likely that your boss will want you to take advantage of in-house training first unless there are good reasons otherwise
The timing of the training: If the training falls right when you're most needed on deck, it won't fly as well as selecting training during down times. Many short-term management courses try to take this into account but this is very dependent on your workplace patterns and your region's wind-down times
The cost of the training: This will have an enormous impact on the answer – if it's expensive, build a case as to why you're worth it and what value this will return to your organization
The location of the training: If you need to go to another state or country, you will have transportation and accommodation costs to take into account as well
Colleague involvement: Is the training you are suggesting likely to benefit others in the organization beyond you? If so, will this fit their schedules too? Could the organization afford to have several of you away at once? And would a discount be applicable if several of you attended the training at the same time?

, Take a few moments of your boss' time to explain your wish to have further training in particular leadership skills. Don't give too many details when discussing; just the general flavor of why you believe that training would benefit your role as a manager, how this would benefit the organization, and what sort of training you have in mind. Offer to send an email detailing the suggestions.

, Once more outline your reasons for wanting the training and how this benefits the organization. Provide the training suggestions with succinct features pulled out next to each option. Include URLs where possible so that your boss can check each option quickly while reading online.

, If your boss doesn't come around to your way of thinking immediately, don't pressure. Bide the time a little and return to the subject after a few weeks have passed with no response. If your boss doesn't agree with the request for training, seek a reason and look for ways to respond to that constructively. For example, if your boss thinks it is the wrong time, suggest a time that is more suitable; if your boss thinks it is too expensive, look for a more affordable option, etc. And remind your boss of the benefits of improved managerial awareness overall.

Discuss teamwork with your group.,
Understand team member styles.,
Practice effective leadership.",How to Promote Teamwork at Your Workplace1," Before you can work together as a team, your group will need to be made aware of the benefits that can come from teamwork. It's possible that everyone will not be willing to work as a unit and careful examination and explanation of the benefits that teamwork can bring changing minds and building a stronger team.Ask people to write down positive and negative ideas they have about teamwork.
Work together to address negative concerns or attitudes.
For example, someone might be concerned that teamwork can hurt an individual and their expression of ideas. The ways in which a team can actually help empower an individuals ideas should be highlighted in response.;
, It is thought that there are a number of team member “styles” that might be found in any group. These styles describe how an individual acts within a team and can suggest which roles they might best play in the group as well as allow you to create a well balanced team. Take a moment to review the following four main team member styles:Contributors tend to focus the team on specific and immediate tasks.
Collaborators usually focus on the group and project as a whole.
Communicators strive to create open, positive, and constructive communication amongst the team.
Challengers like to highlight difficulties and push the team to higher levels of quality and performance.

, There are a few different types of leaders and studies have shown that some leadership styles are more effective than others. More importantly some leadership styles can actually result in negative performance from teams under such leadership. If you are leading a team try to embody one of the following styles of leadership:The transformational leader inspires the team by creating and sharing a vision for the teams mission. They urge team members to challenge standards and think outside the box to achieve goals.
The empowering leader will urge team members to take on self-leadership and let them and their choices inform the direction of the team.

Communicate the status of the task regularly with all those involved.
Identify any problems with completing a task as they arise. Do your best to foresee problematic issues before they come to fruition so that you can head them off.
Deliver as promised and ahead of time.

, Your manager can help you prepare for management by giving you opportunities to manage small tasks, teaching you some of the skills related to management and guiding you into open management positions within the company.

, This may mean accepting more responsibility without receiving a pay raise or title change, but you need to keep your long-term management goal in mind when sizing up such opportunities.

, The more you know about how your company works, the more you will know about personnel needs and the easier it will be for you to spot management career opportunities as they arise.

, If you want to be the first person considered for a management position opening, you should already stand out amongst your coworkers as a natural leader. Pursue excellence in job competence, reliability and other managerial qualities and your managers will notice.

, Your managers and coworkers should perceive you as someone who is easy to work with. Otherwise, you can expect that the next management career opportunity will go to someone who is.

, Prepare for management by taking pride in your appearance and dressing in a way that commands respect. Make sure your clothes are ironed, your shoes are shined and you are well-groomed.

, The way you feel about yourself and your own ability to lead will be apparent to those around you. If you feel confident, then others will feel confident in you.

, A good leader knows how to provide constructive criticism when the need arises. When the time comes for you to give an opinion of a coworker, handle the situation with care and always critique the job as opposed to the person.

Chat with your staff.,
Write a thank-you note.,
Buy small tokens of appreciation.,
Take your employee to lunch.,
Tell your employees when you hear them complimented.,
Use small rewards to build momentum.",How to Recognize Your Employees1," Something as simple as stopping by to talk to employees will make them feel recognized. Stop by on a Friday afternoon so that employees can feel validated before heading off to the weekend.You don’t have to say much. Ask them how their week went and what their plans are during the weekend. Be prepared to share your own plans.
Some employees are uncomfortable talking to the boss, so note if they don’t have much to say. You can recognize them in other ways.;
, Almost 75% of people save handwritten thank-you notes.You don’t have to say much. Remember not to give a generic thank-you, but identify the accomplishment and explain its significance.For example, you can write something like, “Jaxon, thanks for working late all last week. We’ve closed the quarter with the most sales ever, thanks to you.”
You have to be sincere.Accordingly, you shouldn’t write a thank-you note unless you really have a reason to thank them.
Write out thank-you notes ahead of time. For example, write “Kevin, I want to thank you for” and then leave the rest blank. When you think of something, you can fill in the rest of the sentence. By writing notes like this ahead of time, you’ll be on the lookout for excellent performance to reward.

, The gift doesn’t need to be large. In fact, it should be proportional to the accomplishment you are rewarding. If someone stayed late on Friday afternoon, you can give them a small gift costing no more than $10. However, someone who increased your department’s sales by 50% should be given a much larger reward, in addition to a bonus.


Try to find out what your employee likes ahead of time. Generic gifts are okay, but it’s better to give them something you know they’ll appreciate.For example, where do they get coffee in the morning? You can get them a $20 gift card to the coffee shop.

, If you don’t know what to give someone for a gift, then take them out to lunch and pick up the tab.This is a great gift because you can get to know your employee by asking them questions about their life.


Be honest with yourself. If you aren’t that interested in talking to your employees, then don’t take them to lunch, which could be awkward. Your employee will pick up on the vibe that you aren’t really interested in talking to them.
However, to facilitate conversation, you can have them choose a coworker to come along.

, You might be at a meeting with other department heads when one of them praises a member of your team. Be sure to relay this compliment to your employee.All you need to do is drop by someone’s desk and say, “I just spoke to Carl in Accounting. He said you helped him reconcile some numbers last Thursday. He couldn’t stop praising how helpful you were.”
You can also create a recognition bulletin board. Print out emails from people complimenting your team members and post the email to the board.

, You can be strategic with the rewards you give. For example, a mediocre employee might need a lot of reinforcement right out of the gate. Remember to celebrate small accomplishments, such as someone’s first sale or their first week on the job.Of course, an employee eventually needs to do excellent work without the positive reinforcements. But it can’t hurt to reward people early, so that you can reinforce positive work habits.

Implement data and office area access restrictions.,
Watch employees from a distance.,
Restrict unauthorized websites.,
Use Biometric Identification Systems.,
Avoid workers from bringing out items from office/ company premises.,
Prevent Company Data Piracy.",How to Prevent Employee Theft," This must be done prior to hiring an employee. Search for history of gambling, drug problems, debt or other factors that might pressure him to pilfer. Determine the potential employees’ behavior and work attitude through his references from past employment. You must provide full disclosure of this beforehand not only because the law requires it from employers. Also, this eliminates the perception that the company does not implement strict measures for preventing and dealing with employment theft.;
, The FBI also suggests that being lenient with employee access to classified data and other valued properties provide opportunity for stealing. Limit the right to open or use company files, storage facilities and computer data to those who need it. Do not grant access of company development plans, to those in the sales or customer service department.

, Sometimes, employees need to know that someone is watching them to keep them from doing a wrong move. Using internet protocol (IP) cameras allow employers and managers to record and monitor stealing occurrences and people’s productivity at work even if you’re at another location.

, With the use of Web filters, you can restrict the company’s Internet access to certain gaming and gambling websites, as well as social sites like Facebook or Twitter. Through this, you are already controlling employees from robbing you off the time you pay them for work-related tasks.

, Employees’ tardiness may be one issue to handle but timesheet fraud related to this is definitely another to control. Utilizing Biometric Identification technology accurately monitors the employees’ at work. This also keeps colleagues from punching in other colleagues’ time card to cover up for their lateness and prolonged breaks.

, Results from the 24th annual Retail Theft Survey carried out by inventory- protection consulting firm Jack L. Hayes International consultancy show that for every retail company, one out of 36 employees was caught pilfering in 2011. The total value stolen in that year amounted to more than $47 million in the retail business. The radio frequency identification system (RFID) is one of several types of wireless security systems that uses radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data from the products’ RFID tags to readers and enables easy tracking and retail inventory.

, According to a recent survey conducted by Iron Mountain, employees are more susceptible to steal data when he leaves the company. To avoid this, one must establish and implement strict policies of confidentiality, as well as those regarding accessing, transferring, and handling information. There are also online sources on information safety that suggest the restriction of using portable devices. Constantly changing a company’s online accounts like those for cloud data storage also blocks employees from accessing data after termination.

Create a team that is the right size.,
Set concrete due dates for the team's goals.,
Establish protocols for team interaction.,
Make each member's goals clear.",How to Promote Teamwork at Your Workplace2," There are certain sizes that work best when it comes to team work. The number of people will affect how easily they are able to communicate and how clearly roles and responsibilities are defined. Keep your team size balanced to help maintain effective teamwork.The ideal size for a team is between two to five members.
A five to ten member team is possible. However it may prove difficult to manage.
Any teams larger than ten members will likely need to be divided into smaller sub-teams.

, Although your team will likely have an ultimate deadline for the total project, breaking the goal down into smaller goals and deadlines can help the team stay on target. Try making the larger team goal into smaller goals each with their own deadlines.For example, you might create a planning phase where the team coordinates their efforts by a certain time.
Each phase will have a sequential due date, culminating in the final project and deadline.
Breaking goals down can help the team keep track of their progress.

, Your team will need to work well together and creating proper protocols and inter-team responsibilities can help facilitate this. By making these instructions clear your team will effectively be able to communicate and achieve their goals together.Set deadlines for responses to phone messages or emails.
Make attendance to meetings mandatory.
You might offer a form for your team mates to sign indicating they have read and are committed to the team policies.

, A good team will have clear cut and very well defined roles and responsibilities for each team member. These will help them to focus on their specific tasks as well as understand what other members are currently working on. Delegating work in this way lets everyone work effectively both individually and as a team.Without clear goals team members may overlap and perform redundant tasks.
Clear goals for each team member will help the effectiveness of the entire team.
Objective goals allows for evaluation and improvement of performance on both individual and team levels.

Express the value of cooperation.,
Share team members strengths.,
Manage conflict effectively.,
Cultivate emotional awareness in your team.",How to Promote Teamwork at Your Workplace3," If your team doesn't see the value or believe that working together cooperatively is a wise choice then the team will fail. Whenever you are assembling a team each member must fully believe in and be committed to working together to achieve the aim of that group.Any member or members who aren't convinced that teamwork is a good idea will hurt the entire team effort.
Make sure each member is ready to fully work together towards the team's goals.

, Chances are a team member will already know their own role and skills that they bring to the team. However it is just as important that each team member be aware of the strengths and skills of the other team members. This allows for each team member to help others or fulfill other roles more effectively.During any bonding or socializing events make sure to include a portion where everyone has an opportunity to present their skills or strengths.
When each team member knows what the others are capable of team efficiency will benefit.

, A benefit of working together is the introduction of multiple ideas and view points, allowing the team to find solutions that an individual might have missed. Unfortunately, team work can also cause conflict to arise when ideas or discussions clash. Have your team work through conflict, using it to their benefit.Conflict can cause team effectiveness to fail.
Try to resolve conflict before it grows into a more serious issues.

, Part of being a human is having and feeling emotions. While many emotions can lead to a positive and healthy team there are some that can pose a threat to the cohesion of the group. By training your team in matters of emotional intelligence you can help avoid any emotional difficulties or outbursts that could injure the team effort.The first step in emotional awareness is being aware and managing ones own emotions.
Self motivation to work as a team is critical to the overall effort.
Being aware of others emotional states is important when working with others constructively.

Compliment staff at meetings.Your staff meeting is an opportunity to praise employees in front of their colleagues for outstanding effort.,
Send a note to someone’s supervisor.,
Celebrate birthdays.Everyone has a birthday, and you can make them feel special by having the entire office recognize it.,
Name an employee of the month.,
Avoid recognizing some employees publicly.,
Put on a recognition ceremony—the right way.",How to Recognize Your Employees2," Take advantage of these moments. They don’t cost anything, and you can increase employee performance by doing so.


All you need to say is something like, “I need to give a shout-out to Melissa’s excellent work on the Kingsley Account. I heard back from Arthur Kingsley himself, who told me Melissa had answers to all of his questions.”
However, you must be timely. Preferably, you should recognize someone within a week of the event that warrants the praise.
Spread around some of the love. If you only compliment the same one or two people, then the other staff will become resentful. However, don’t feel obligated to praise someone if they don’t deserve it.

, Instead of praising someone directly, you can praise them by sending an email to their direct supervisor. Make sure to copy the employee on the email.For example, you can write something like, “Tom, I just wanted to give you a heads up on what a great speech Chris gave to the company’s shareholders yesterday. She’s a credit to your unit and I’m sure she’ll go far.”

, Shut down an hour early (if possible) and gather the entire staff in a conference room for cake and other treats.


You can also recognize employees for “business birthdays,” i.e., milestones such as 20 years with the company. However, you still need to follow the advice in this article—make sure the recognition is tailored to the employee and mentions specific things they have done for the company. Simply sending a plastic keychain won’t cut it.

, Walk into any grocery store and you’ll probably see people’s pictures on a wall as employees of the month. Do something similar in your office. If you don’t want to put up people’s pictures, then give them a plaque or other gift.Also post your recognition to your website, if there’s space to recognize accomplishments.Feel free to skip a month if you don’t think an employee has done anything to warrant recognition. You don’t want employees to think all they need do is “wait their turn” to be given recognition.

, True recognition must be tailored to the employee. If someone doesn’t want public recognition, the worst thing you can do is to ask them to stand up in front of their co-workers as you talk about them.


Be alert to how your employees handle public recognition. Do they blush when having to speak in front of others? They might be shy.
If you sense an employee hates being publicly praised, then choose some of the other options discussed in this article. A thank-you note might be better.

, Some larger businesses have monthly or annual recognition ceremonies. Unfortunately, these ceremonies usually hold little meaning for employees because they are not individualized. Instead, an employee is given a plaque by someone who they don’t really know, and the praise is general.A better approach is to make sure that the person giving the award knows the value of each employee’s contribution. Accordingly, don’t have someone from Human Resources give the award. Instead, a direct supervisor should.
The supervisor should also write down in detail how the employee has contributed to the company. Be specific. For example, “Michael’s first five years with the company has seen a 120% growth in revenue, most of it in his department alone” is much better than “Michael is such a great member of the team.”

Encourage mentoring.,
Help employees grow.Prove that you value employees by giving them opportunities to develop as people and professionals.,
Treat the entire office.,
Don’t forget your part-time employees.,
Discourage blaming.",How to Recognize Your Employees3," Recognition involves more than naming an employee of the month. Instead, you must also create a culture of gratitude.Begin by asking staff whether they feel appreciated. For example, you can create a survey on SurveyMonkey or ask them in individual meetings.


Also ask people what their idea of a fun event is. Look for patterns. For example, most of the fun events probably involve food.
Ask employees how they would prefer to be recognized. Publicly? Individually? Cash? Non-cash rewards?

, Time is valuable, so having an open-door policy tells your staff you value them. Make sure to set aside your work if they do come in to talk. It’s rude to be scrolling through your email as staff members are trying to talk with you.

, If they can’t think of anything, then just thank the colleague for being there.


Don’t make people sit in a conference room as they thank each other. This is too much of a chore. Instead, announce “Thank-You Thursdays” by email and leave it to employees to thank each other.
Remember to set the tone and thank each member of your staff. Your employees will follow your lead.

, Mentoring helps seasoned employees and new hires flourish. You give established employees a boost of confidence by trusting them enough to mentor.Mentoring also allows the mentor to recognize the mentee’s accomplishments, thus increasing the self-confidence of new hires.

, Encourage your staff to take classes outside of work and reimburse them for the tuition.


Also pay for employees to attend trainings or an annual conference.
You can also create a learning library. Buy books, audiobooks, and videos that employees can check out and take home. Also solicit their input about what material the library should stock., You can change the culture by having fun events for all staff members. This differs from individually recognizing people. Instead, you are giving a thank-you to the entire office, which is much more inclusive.For example, schedule something fun on Mondays to ease people back into work.You can buy coffee, donuts, and bagels for your staff to enjoy.
Schedule a dinner for the entire team once a month and pick up the tab. By getting to know your employees in a social setting, you can find out what motivates them as well as what triggers negative reactions.
Also think about shutting down the office early on a Friday afternoon so that everyone can start the weekend early.

, It can be very easy to overlook part-time employees as well as temps. You shouldn’t. They want to feel recognized just as much as your full-time staff.Include them in team dinners and praise them during staff meetings.

, Blame is the worst kind of recognition. Blame is also contagious, so your office can soon descend into a culture of back-stabbing.Actively discourage blaming in your staff meetings as well as in your individual interactions with staff.


For example, you can say, “It’s not really important who is to blame for the printer running out of ink. I’m just interested in making sure we have the problem fixed so it doesn’t happen again.”
Also own up to your own failures. This can create a sense of security in the office, as your team members realize they can fess up to mistakes without fear of punishment.
Of course, sometimes you need to know who is at fault so that you can help them learn how to avoid making the mistake. Call employees to your office and ask what happened. Stress that you aren’t going to punish anyone, you just realize training has fallen short somewhere.

Identify Relevant Performance Objectives.,
Ensure that results can be measured and achieved.This is not just for you – the people working toward their objectives need to be able to track progress and success, too.,
Communicate performance objectives to employees.,
Train employees in proper process.,
Write report explaining performance objectives.,
Explain how the achievement of each goal will be measured.Determine how the person will know when the objective has been completed.,
State the desired outcome clearly.,
State how performance objectives relate to larger organizational goals.Individual employee objectives should directly relate to the achievement of larger company goals.,
Confirm buy-in from appropriate groups.,
Confirm training has been completed and tools are available.,
Consider incentives for performance.,
Choose a realistic start and end date for each objective.Your target dates should be logical within the context of the objective.",How to Write Performance Objectives," Spend some time thinking about the work that needs to be performed. Sit down, brainstorm and take some notes.Consider what performance outcomes are critical to company success. This usually considers such factors as productivity (amount of work to be performed within a unit of time), cycle time (how long it takes), quality (error rate per std volume), or cost.Pinpoint exactly what a person is expected to do. For example, identify an objective measure such as produce x widgets per hour with 98% pass through rate. Then, zero in on what specific knowledge they need in order to meet that expectation.For example, if an employee is not being as productive as he or she could be, then the data might show that idle time is to blame. Therefore, the solution might be for the employee to work on is or her time management skills.
Performance objectives need to be very specific and objective, so look closely at details.Also, make sure that the goals you are setting directly apply to that person’s actual job or position. Is the objective something that the person can manage or change? Confirm that the objective is something that makes sense for a person in their particular role within the organization.;
, Vague objectives can't be properly measured, have no value and can be open to interpretation, which you definitely want to avoid. To prevent this, be certain that there is a way for people to measure their progress.


Be prepared to explain in a clear, concise way on paper what this measurement is and how it works. For example, a freshman level botany student whose goal is to understand how plants grow from seed might be expected to raise a tomato plant from seed to fruition. The tomato plant is the measurable outcome.
Confirm that the desired outcome for each objective is achievable.One of the primary goals of writing performance objectives for people is to motivate them to succeed. Objectives that include outcomes that the person can't directly influence or change will have the opposite effect.Aim for objectives that will challenge the person in a reasonable way.
Pinpoint how the person's individual performance, not external factors, will be the primary determinant in the achievement of the goal. The goals need to be realistic, given the skills of the person in question and resources available. Identify the specific resources and assistance the person will have in achieving the goal.

, Pinpoint what your expectations are then explain them to your employees.Once you’ve identified what your desired outcome is for each objective, you need to be certain that the objective will produce the desired outcome. Explain in a clear and direct way what that outcome actually is.


For example, if you plan to ask a marketing associate to complete a monthly newsletter for the company, then you would expect this newsletter to be submitted each month, on a particular day, without fail.

, It is important to teach your employees how to achieve the performance objectives using the proper process. Make sure that you explain the proper process to them before the changes are implemented.


Consider what type of action must be taken. What will the person need to do in order to achieve the goal?Think about what concepts need to be understood, what types of analysis and tasks they should be capable of, and what kind of problems they need to be able to solve.For example, a new employee who needs to increase productivity will be asked to learn better time management skills. To accomplish this, the employee will attend a webinar each Friday that covers this topic and provides helpful tips.

, Write a report that explains the performance objectives and how the will be implemented. Include as much detail as possible. You can share this report with your superiors and internal customers. Some ways to make your report as clear as possible include:


Use action verbs for each objective. Action verbs are specific to the task and demonstrate exactly what the person needs to do to achieve the objective. Good examples of action verbs are: increase, establish, create, reduce, design, organize, participate, implement, produce, perform, plan, investigate.
Avoid vague behavioral verbs. These can be confusing and are usually unable to be accurately measured. Some examples include be aware of, familiarize, study, become acquainted with, gain knowledge of, understand, comprehend, know, learn, appreciate, cover, realize.Written example: The Safety Operations Manager will send weekly email memos to every department that clearly instruct employees on safety techniques.

, For example, the employee who writes memos with safety instructions might be measured based on the number of safety-related worker's compensation claims.


Choose goals that have outcomes that can be quantified.
Written objective example: The production manager will communicate via email with vendors on a weekly basis to ensure that sufficient quantities of production supplies are on hand at all times. By December 2016, the company expects to experience no shortages in supplies and will measure this by doing a monthly inventory to confirm supply levels.

, Explain what the desirable result or outcome will be when the person has successfully reached the performance objective goal.For example, if you want an employee with ""excellent written communication skills,"" think about the specific ways those skills will be used.


Written objective example: By November 2016, the junior sales associate will create persuasive ad copy that increases sales for the company by 10%.
A time frame is given, the job position relates to the task, expectations are clearly stated, and an active verb is used to show what is to be done.

, Individual student goals should relate to the institution's educational objectives. This can provide additional motivation for the person asked to reach them.


Written objective example: The Safety Manager will send weekly memos via email to all department heads with safety instructions and tips. By August 2016, the company expects that the number of safety-related worker's compensation claims will decrease by 30%. Achieving this goal will create a safe work environment for all employees and contribute to the stellar reputation of the company.
Connecting individual objectives to group goals helps ensure that the performance objectives are relevant and meaningful.

, Make sure that everyone who should be aware of the changes is aware of the changes. This includes senior management, supervisors, employees, etc. You might make everyone aware by sending out a memo or email that explains the changes.

, Make sure that anyone who is subject to the changes has undergone the appropriate training. You might also check to confirm that everyone has access to information on the changes, such as by providing an informative packet or access to online materials.


It might also be a good idea to have someone in charge of confirming that employees have undergone the training, or having employees sign off on having read about the changes.

, To increase the chances that your employees will adhere to the changes, you may consider providing benefits to employees who follow the new procedure. You might also consider penalizing employees who do not follow the new procedure.

Benefits might include a pizza lunch at the end of the week if productivity has increased, or even a cash bonus for the highest performing employee.
Penalties might include a verbal warning or assigning an unpleasant or boring task to the lowest performer.

, Once you’ve identified your time frame, set up a few milestones to be measured along the way. These check points can be motivating and help the person stay on track.

Depending on the size of your organization, you might assign an individual or a team to the project.HR is typically responsible for writing an employee handbook, but department managers would probably be a better choice for a policies and procedures manual. If you are the owner of a small company, you can take on the task yourself, as long as you have some time to commit to it.
Make sure the person in charge of writing the manual has strong writing skills. It's very important that the manual be clear and easy to read.;
, Your manual needs to communicate policies to all of your employees as efficiently as possible, so it should be straightforward and easy to read.Be cautious about using too much industry jargon, especially if you have some employees who may not be familiar with it at all.
Use acronyms sparingly and clarify any that you do use.
Make sure the language of your manual fits with the culture of your company.
Formatting is important too. Make sure your headings are bold, you have a clear table of contents, and there is enough white space so that employees can easily skim the document to find the information they need.

, Depending on the type of business you have and the type of manual you are putting together, you might really benefit from the cooperation of your whole team. In order to make sure that you get the most out of everyone, be sure to communicate to all of your employees the purpose of the manual and the importance of their input.Try to emphasize the benefits that the manual will bring to your employees, such as clarifying confusing procedures or decreasing the amount of time it will take new employees to get settled. Otherwise they may just see the manual as a disciplinary document.

, Before you get started on your project, you should have a clear understanding of who will be working on it and in what capacity. It's especially important to decide who will be responsible for the final review before the manual is distributed.

, Your office manual will be an ever-changing document, so you need to plan on updating it frequently. You need to decide from the beginning who will be responsible for updating the manual and how often revisions will be done.You can also encourage employees to notify a point person whenever they notice a change that needs to be made to the manual.
Depending on your organization, you may choose to print hard copies of your manual, or you may opt to have an electronic manual, which will be much easier to update frequently.

, Start by coming up with a list of tasks that each department at your organization is responsible for completing.You can assign this task to a single person or to one individual in each department. If it falls on one person, make sure he or she has the support of the department heads.

, Once you know what each department is responsible for, determine exactly what tasks each employee does within each department. This will help you evenly distribute the workload and will leave you better prepared to hire new employees when the time comes.It may be helpful to create an organizational chart that outlines who each employee should report to, especially if this is currently unclear in your organization.

, Once you have a list of tasks that each employee is responsible for, it's time to dig deeper into each task and write step-by-step instructions for how to complete them. The point of this is to help in the training of new employees and to make it easier for existing employees to cover each other's work during absences.Make sure to outline details such as where documents are saved, where certain supplies are kept, and how to contact vendors and customers.
It's a good idea to have someone review each task by attempting to complete it by following the instruction precisely. Make sure the reviewer is not the same person who typically completes the task. It will quickly become apparent if there are missing steps or inefficiencies.

, In addition to outlining the procedures for daily tasks that your employees complete, be sure to account for larger projects that occur infrequently, such as quarterly reviews or annual presentations.Try to establish a schedule for each of these tasks so that new employees will understand when to begin preparing for them.

, In addition to providing details about how to complete the tasks required of the job, you may wish to provide your new employees with some extra tips to help get them acquainted with the office. This will reduce their reliance on other employees, and hopefully make them feel comfortable more quickly. You may want to include information on things like:


The location of the bathrooms, break rooms, and mail room
How to use the phone, printer, computer, and other equipment
Where to park
How to order supplies

, There are probably a lot of things you want to include in your employee handbook, but you may not know that there are also things you are legally required to include. You need to make sure to include information on equal employment opportunities, harassment, family medical leave, accommodations for people with disabilities. worker's compensation, military leave, breast feeding accommodations, and leave for victims of a crime.If applicable, include information about the company's non-disclosure agreements and/or conflict of interest statements.If the work environment is dangerous in any way, include information about the steps you take to ensure employee safety, as well as what they employees are expected to do.Although not legally required, it's also a good idea to include clauses regarding the company's right to terminate employees at will and to make changes to the manual. This will help protect the company if a former employee files a lawsuit.
Employment laws are different in every state. It's a good idea to consult an attorney before you publish your employee handbook, just to make sure you didn't include or omit anything that might be damaging.

, Your employee handbook should clearly communicate to employees when they are expected to be in the office and how many hours they are expected to work each week.Also include information about overtime pay, being sure to clearly state who is and is not eligible for overtime.
Make sure employees know how to report an absence.
If you offer flexible hours, outline the procedure for taking advantage of this benefit.
Let employees know when and how they should expect their paychecks as well.

, Be sure to devote a section of your manual to benefits, including paid time off, medical insurance, life insurance, the company's 401k plan, and anything else you offer. Be thorough in your explanations of these benefits so that most questions can be answered simply by consulting the manual.If your benefits are provided by an outside provider, let employees know where to find more information about the program.
If you have a combination of hourly and salaried employees or part-time and full-time employees, be sure to clearly outline who falls into which category and what benefits are available to whom., The employee handbook is also the place to establish the rules by which your employees must abide. You can also establish a disciplinary procedure, but make sure it is not so specific that it may not be appropriate in certain circumstances.Common topics covered by the code of conduct include:


Unexcused absences and late arrivals
Dress code
Drug/alcohol policy
How to interact with clients and coworkers
Social media policy

, Your employees will find it helpful if they know exactly how their performance reviews will be conducted and when to expect them. Be as specific as possible in outlining the procedures and the expectations., Your office probably has a lot more procedures than you would imagine, so it may take some time to think of everything you need to address in your manual. Try to think about all of the questions a new employee might have about how your office works, including things like:


How to clock in and out
Lunch and break policies
Telecommuting policies
How to request time off
How to file a complaint against a coworker
Inclement weather policies

Incorporate other good internal communications practices.",How to Write an Internal Communications Plan," The purpose of the plan is to provide information quickly, clearly, accurately, and evenly to employees across the company. This will allow employees to engage with the operations of the company and with other employees more easily, increasing productivity and reducing lag time between communications. It can also reduce the frustration of uneven or slow communication. In this way, the plan will increase overall performance and employee retention., Before creating a new communications plan, you'll need to diagnose the problems with your current communications. Make sure to examine the whole organization, from top to bottom and in all departments. Look for blockages, information delays, uneven information, and issues with accuracy or clarity. Ask the following questions for each communication line:


Is the information accurate?
Is the information needed?
How are regular updates sent?
Is this information consistent across the organization?
Are employees on board with current communications protocols?, Internal communications is geared toward everyone who works within an organization. Before you communicate with your staff, there is some basic information you need to discover about them.Ask them how they feel about the current level of internal communication. Discern whether they feel informed about changes, if they feel comfortable sharing their opinions, and how they would like to see communication improve.
Ask the hard questions. See if they would be willing to share specific examples of when they felt out of the loop or ignored. Try not to be defensive when they share;listen with an open mind.
Identify how employees like to receive information: email, newsletter, face-to-face, or other options. Ask if the method depends on what information is shared. For example, a weekly announcement can be communicated via email, but a major staff change needs to be shared in person.

, Figure out first who is in charge of initiating and then finally approving the plan. Any actions taken to create a communication plan will have to be preceded by that person or group's approval. Then, figure out who will write the plan. This is often a communications expert (either from the company or external) or a team of representative from various departments. However, it can also be a combination of the two.


Teaming up in this way will allow the different departments to be involved from the start, while still allowing the expert to do their work., Start by considering what format you want to use. You might use a document, presentation, or spreadsheet, depending on who will be using the document and how. Then, consider the length of your plan. It needs to be long enough to cover all of the information, but still short enough to be useful and accessible. For example, a simple plan might be 2-4 pages, while a more complex one could be up to 15. Start writing your plan by making a basic structure with the following parts:


The title.
The stated purpose of the plan (increase clarity, productivity, sales, etc.).
Executive summary that outlines the rest of the plan.
A process section explaining the current situation and changes to be made.
A section detailing how the plan's implementation and success will be measured.
A segmentation or mapping of the various bodies that need to be communicated with.
A description of the various communication channels and when/how they will be used.
The approval process and list of plan creators.
A timeline for implementation.
An appendix for additional documents., If the highest leaders in your organization are not willing to support an internal communications plan, your job becomes convincing them of its importance. Without their support, little will change in your internal communications. People will remain uninformed and unsure of what is going on.Outline the ways that an internal communication plan can lead to increased trust and productivity. (Employees work harder when they feel like a part of what's going on.)
Talk about how an internal communications plan can increase efficiency. (The plan ensures that all information flows effectively, and that all employees are adequately informed of changes in a timely way.)

, Many companies will have just two major tiers of communication: the highest level and everybody else. Consider placing some of your managers in the know regarding high-level communications. These managers will be better in tune with how best to communicate to the rest of the staff. These ""mid-level"" employees can help the organization decide when and how to share specific messages., For now, focus on a single message that you would like to communicate, perhaps your vision or mission statement. As you develop your internal communications plan, include announcements about upcoming events, important company information, staff changes, and other news items., There are various ways to share your information. Identify all potential methods of communication and what type of messages should come through each one. Consider which method is best, not only for your employees and their preferences, but also for the message and situation at hand. For example, sensitive situations tend to require face-to-face communication, not emails or a newsletter.Formal methods are intentional acts of communication and include scheduled meetings, company newsletters, all staff emails or meetings, and reports.
Informal networks are more organic conversations that take place in offices, break rooms, and during lunch. They can also occur via email, social media accounts, and phone conversations.

, Internal communications should be a team effort. Communications staff should play a role in writing the message, even if it is just proofreading, editing, and offering suggestions for word choices. Take the time to work through several drafts, continually improving the choice of words.Make sure you give the ""why"" of the communication, not just the ""what.""
In other words, do not simply give directives. Explain the reasoning behind those directives., Proofread, if this will be a written communication. Poor spelling and grammar will reflect negatively on the leader and on the organization as a whole.Let your message sit while you do something else (at least 15-20 minutes).
Then return to your message and read it over for clarity and correctness.

, Make sure enough background information is provided to give context to lower-level employees. They do not have access to the information higher-level leaders have. Give them what they need to know to fully comprehend the news being shared.If you are drafting an email that talks about a change in company policy, explain some of what led up to this change.
Let's say your company is changing the way employees request vacation days. In your email, explain that this change is being implemented to a provide more accessible public calendar, so that all employees can anticipate planned employee absences and work to prepare for them.
Your employees will see the benefit of this change and not view it as a nuisance.

, Decide who needs to be the one to give final approval on this message. It will most likely be the highest leader in your organization. Send this message their way and see if it passes. If not, make any necessary revisions and try again., Even if communications staff members help craft the message, certain types of messages may need to come from a leader of the organization. Or it may be decided that each supervisor will share the message with their team. Determine what is appropriate for each situation., Your message should be delivered in a timely manner. This will differ depending on the situation. However, a good principle of organizational communication is that your staff should know before the public knows. You may want to consider staging messages so that higher-level staff are informed first, then lower-level staff.Let's say your business is merging with another company. Of course, the highest level employees will know about the change first. However, you don't want the rest of your employees to simply show up one morning to see a different name on the door.
Create a schedule for informing high-level employees, then lower-level employees, and then the public.

, After communicating important information, you need to see how it was received. You can do this through staff surveys, meetings, one-on-one, casual chats, and lunches. Encourage staff to ask questions whenever they do not understand or agree with specific messages. Create an atmosphere of engagement by making it clear that you don't simply talk at your employees, but you also listen and respond. This ensure that employees are engaged, not simply taking orders., To keep internal communications running smoothly, there are some structures to put into place. Decide which ones will work best for your organization.Follow through on things like performance reviews, one-on-one meetings, and staff meetings. Employees need to know they can trust you to keep your word and to keep information flowing.
Encourage face-to-face communication between team leaders and team members. Communication cannot be entirely via electronic devices if you want relationships to develop.

Get the handbook reviewed by a lawyer before using it.",How to Write an Employee Handbook," The employee handbook should include a general introductory paragraph that outlines the purpose of the handbook. You should welcome the employee to the company and discuss the company’s goal of being a rewarding place to work for employees. You should also reiterate the importance of the employer/employee relationship.For example, you may state: “We at are confident you will find our company is a dynamic and engaging place to work, and we look forward to your contribution to our continued success. We consider our employees to be our most valuable resource. This handbook will serve as guide for the relationship between employer and employee.”;
, You should also make sure the introduction to the handbook contains a disclaimer that the handbook is not a legal, binding contract between employer and employee. This will help to prevent legal disputes and protect your company in the event of a legal issue in the future.For example, you may state: “This handbook only contains general information and guidelines. It is not a binding legal contract and does not act as a contractual right to remain employed by the company.”

, This is another important disclaimer that should be included in the employee handbook. You should make sure you state that your company is not obligated to retain employees and note that an employee can be dismissed at the discretion of the company. This will ensure the handbook is not seen as a contract by employees or cannot be used as such in a court of law.For example, you may state: “Your employment may be terminated at any time with or without cause and without prior notice by the company. You may also resign at any time.”

, You should also include an acknowledgement page that needs to be acknowledged and signed by the employee. This will ensure the employee has agreed to the terms of the handbook and signifies the employee understands the policies in the handbook.You can find samples of an acknowledge page for employees through the Society for Human Resource Management website and the National Federation of Independent Business website.

, Most federal and state governing bodies require companies to provide a clear, detailed wage policy in the employee handbook. Each state has different employment laws and require you to include different information about employee wages in the handbook. Get familiar with your state’s laws to ensure you cover all the requirements.You may need to check the federal laws for employers through the U.S. Department of Labor website, or your country’s applicable Department of Labor website. Make sure you are clear about the requirements for your company’s handbook before you outline any policies or expectations.

, Your employee handbook should note your legal obligations on pay schedules and overtime pay. Your employees should know how often they are getting paid as well as if they get paid for overtime work. You should outline the expected work hours for your employees, depending on if they are full-time or part-time.Include descriptions of exempt and non-exempt employees. Exempt employees are typically upper-level management and are excluded from laws governing minimum wage, overtime, and other wage practices.Your description should include the definition of overtime. For example, working longer that 9 hours per day, 40 hours per week, holidays, etc. Be sure to mention that travel time or prep time to be ready for work are compensated.
You should also note your company’s policy on coffee breaks and lunch breaks, such as how long each employee is allowed for these breaks. This will ensure your employees know what to expect in terms of managing their time.

, In the employee handbook you should also discuss the compensation packages your company offers its employees. This may include bonuses, stock options, and salary increases over time. Make sure you offer compensation packages that are realistic and affordable for the company, as you may need to follow through on these commitments in the future., Your company may be required by state or federal law to offer employee benefits like health benefits, dental benefits, and life insurance. These employee benefits should be briefly outlined in the handbook. You should not go into specific detail as your benefits policies may change and you do not want to put outdated or incorrect information in the handbook.Make sure you should mention who is eligible for benefits, such as full-time employees, part-time employees, and their families and spouses. You should also explain the criteria for enrolling in benefits and when you can change benefits, such as in the event of marriage or the birth of a child.
Your benefits guide should also include details of any company-sponsored retirement or savings plan. Make sure to include any relevant policies such as contribution matching or vesting periods.

, For companies where employees may be required to use their personal property or travel for business purposes, you will need to outline the policy for company reimbursement of these expenses, if any. Be clear on which expenses are the responsibility of the company and which the responsibility of the employee. Outline the process of gaining approval for reimbursement and listing expenditures., Under federal law, you are required to have leave policies in place. You must have a family medical leave providing employees with up to 12 weeks unpaid leave for the birth or care of a child, to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition, or if the employee develops a serious medical condition. You should check your state’s policies for unpaid family leave.You should also explain the company’s policies for holiday leave, such as how much holiday time a year employees are given as part of their employment. You should outline the amount of time allowed for the death of a family member and for sick leave.
Make sure you discuss your company’s vacation leave policy, including how vacation time is earned and how to request time off. You should include a list of holidays observed by the company, with clear details about when the company closes or stays open during holiday times.

, The employee handbook should outline the values and expectations you would like to see in your employees. You should discuss how you would like employees to behave and communicate in the workplace. You should also note a contact person that employees can speak to if they have any questions or clarifications.You should also maintain a positive and encouraging attitude in your discussion of employee expectations. This will keep your employees engaged in the handbook and make it feel accessible to them.
For example, you may note, “We expect our employees to adhere to a high standard of professional conduct and integrity. As an employee, you should be respectful and courteous to the feelings and needs of others. Individuals who act inappropriately or unprofessionally may be subject to disciplinary action.”

, If your workplace has a specific dress code, you should include it in the employee handbook. Make sure you are clear about the requirements for the dress code and specify the company’s expectations for how employees should appear in the workplace.For example, if your company has an office setting, you may have a business casual dress code. You may note that all employees are required to adhere to a business casual dress code and appear well groomed.
Give visual example of acceptable clothing and grooming, since ideas may vary between social groups and generations.
Include specific regulations about beards, visible tattoos, and head apparel that might be religious.
If your employees are often in the field working on construction sites, for example, you may require your employees to wear safety gear or clothing at all times. You should outline these requirements in the handbook so employees are aware of how they should appear every day in the field.

, By law, many states require companies to have a clearly stated equal employment and non-discrimination policy in their employee handbook. You must clearly state that your company prohibits discrimination in the workplace.You should also make sure you discuss the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which specifies anti-discrimination against people with disabilities. You can find out more about the ADA on the Americans with Disabilities website.

, Your company should also have an anti-harassment policy that clearly states that no harassment under any circumstances is tolerated in the workplace. Often you are required by federal or state law to have these policies in place for your employees.You should have a process in place for filing a harassment complaint so employees know how to file a complaint and who to talk to about the issue. You may have a Human Resources representative who is responsible for addressing any harassment complaints in the workplace.

, You should also make sure your employee handbook includes a policy on how to use company computers and software appropriately in the office and off-premise. This is especially important if the majority of the employee work is done on company computers.Make sure you outline how employees can secure their electronic information and protect any passwords or company information on their computers. You should also note any safety measures you have in place to protect the privacy of your employees online and your business’s information.
You should also have guidelines around appropriate use of the computer and what sites employees can and cannot access. You should make sure employees are clear on what sites the company network can be used to access and note the importance of keeping company information private when communicating through email.
Note any security steps that might be viewed as an intrusion of employee's privacy, explaining why they are necessary for company security.

, You should also include details about how your employees are going to be reviewed on their performance in the workplace. You may put a performance review metric in the handbook or include general guidelines on how and when performance reviews will happen for your employees.For example, you may note that employees receive yearly reviews and that positive reviews usually lead to a salary increase or a bonus. You may also discuss disciplinary action that may occur if the employee does not receive a positive performance review, such as a probationary period for the employee, followed by a second performance review or termination.
In particular, note any conduct that might result in immediate dismissal, such as drug and alcohol use, theft, harassment, violence, or other serious offenses.

, Your employees should be aware of all security measures on your premises, including security cameras, detectors, and guards. Include any operating procedures required for getting through security. Describe any off-limits or restricted-access areas, along with a clear description of who is or is not allowed to enter them. For clarity, you may wish to include a map showing these areas., You may be required to comply with Occupational Health and Safety laws in your state and you should mention these laws in your employee handbook. You should note that all employees must report all accidents, injuries, potential safety hazards, and any safety related issues to management.You should also have safety policies in place regarding poor weather or hazardous work conditions. This is especially important if your employees often work in the field or off site.

, You should also include a process for reporting incidents on the job, such as an injury while working or a robbery. Your employees should be aware of how they can report an incident and who they can speak to in the event of an incident.You may have a detailed process in the employee handbook for incident reporting or keep it more general. You may want to opt for a more general discussion if you think the reporting process may change in the future.

, You should also include a clear plan of action in the event of an emergency, such as a fire in the workplace or a natural disaster like flooding or severe weather. You should have an exit plan for employees to follow on a map in the handbook and discuss safety areas or points outside of the building., The employee handbook should be accessible and easy to read for every employee with a tone that is conversational rather than formal or stiff. Try to appeal to every employee by using a tone that is approachable and clear.You can do this by imagining the handbook is a conversation you are having with an employee as an employer. You should use a tone that is clear and friendly when you are talking to your employee, and stay away from formal or stiff language.

, Labor laws can be complex but this does not mean your employee handbook has to be littered with verbiage or jargon. Instead, go for clear language and simplified terms. Having legal terms that are difficult to understand may not protect your company legally in the end and will only alienate the employees that are reading the handbook.You should try to avoid using formal terms like “management” or “authority.” Instead, use “we” or “employer” so the employee does not feel overwhelmed. You want the tone to sound casual, as your employees are more likely to read the handbook in full if it appears friendly and engaging.

, Avoid putting in guidelines in the handbook that are overly demanding or unreasonable. You want the handbook to act as a useful guide for your employees and do not want to create rules that are difficult or impossible to achieve.You should also try to keep the handbook short and sweet, with just enough information to fulfill the state requirements for employee handbooks. You do not want to overwhelm your employees with information or with strict rules that are hard to follow.

, Your employee handbook is a crucial document that could be used in a legal dispute later by your employees. You should get the handbook reviewed by a lawyer or a legal review to make sure your wording is clear and you are not making your company liable for any legal issues in the future. Once it has been cleared by the legal review, it will be ready to distribute to new and current employees at your company."

Start with G - the goal.,
Move on to R - the realities.,
Tackle O - the options.,
Finish with W - the way forward.",How to Use the GROW Method of Problem Solving in a Meeting by Teleconferencing," In one-on-one coaching, the person being coached sets the goal, but in a larger meeting, it’s probably best for the leader to set the goal, getting agreement from the team before proceeding. Try to make the goal clear and not too ambitious for the amount of time scheduled to work on the issue. What is the problem you want to solve? Are you going to try to solve the whole problem, or just decide on some steps to take in working on it?
, The realities are what you know about the situation, what you have already tried, what obstacles there are to a solution, what resources are available, any relevant facts.

To get all the realities on the table, create a Google Doc with multiple blank bullet points. Each person logs into this document from where ever they are so all can see and edit it. Google Docs allows multiple people to edit at once. Each person in the meeting picks a blank line and starts typing in a reality that he/she thinks the group should be aware of. After filling in a line, they hit enter to get a new blank bullet point line to add their next point. The group can talk while this is going on and can be reading what the others are typing. When nobody is adding any more points, move on to the next step. This process helps ensure that everyone can get in their say. The participants don't have to compete for talk time.

, For brainstorming options, use another section of the same Google Doc with multiple blank bullet points. Again, everyone types at once, entering possible things the group could do to achieve the goal or solve the problem being worked on or to gather the additional information needed. It’s OK to enter ideas that seem bad. These might suggest other good ideas that are similar or contrasting. When everyone is done entering ideas, move on to the next step., Evaluate the ideas that were entered in the brainstorming. If the group mostly agrees that they don’t like an option, highlight it with a red background. If most of the group likes an idea, highlight it with a green background. Use yellow for ideas that might have promise, but that not everyone is positive about. As consensus takes shape about some ideas the group likes, decide who will carry out each idea and when it should be done by. That’s the way forward."

,
Set a review cycle of every 2-to-3 years to update the policy and have current top executives sign it again.

",How to Write an Employment Evaluation Policy,"


You will review the employee's capabilities and success according to what the position's job description says. Promotions will depend on the individual assessments.
Make a note to discuss how the employee acts in a professional capacity within the realms of his or her job. Does the staff member interact with the public appropriately? This is an important point in most businesses.
There are, sometimes, poor employee assessments to be addressed. The policy must reflect what will happen in these cases. It ties into the levels discussed in the next step and is often a contributor toward termination.;
,


This means the supervisor will decide the differing levels of evaluation. For example, a person can get a score of 1-to-5 on each question. The total of the assessment questions should be averaged for a final account.
Talk about what the employees should expect with each level of their evaluation. Examples of levels would be that each person with a 5 point average would get a 5 percent raise and so on down to a 1 with no raise.

, These feelings are not relevant to how the staff member performs specific job requirements.

, Multiple people within a department will each have different evaluation questions due to varying duties. Each one will be based on the initial employment evaluation policy.

, Needless to say, it will be tweaked as needed for each individual job due to differing responsibilities.


Ask in the evaluation form if the employee carries out all of his or her specific job requirements as expected. This may be done through more than one question.
Leave a place for supervisor comments of the assessment.
Be sure to capture the employee's assessment of his or her own job. This is extremely important in that the employee will be signing the evaluation.

If you have or have had an existing assistant, just write down what you've had them doing. If not, determine what you will need out of your assistant and write each task and requirement down. You can then use this information to form a job description.

Duties might include letter writing, handling mail, schedules, travel, expense reporting, or any other duties.
Your assistant might also need technical skills, such as general computer use, typing, software programs, dictation, telephone, or other skills.
You might also include general skills like interpersonal communication and multi-tasking.
Describe the required hours, including expectations of work beyond normal hours.
Include a catch-all phrase, like ""duties as assigned"" so that your assistant cannot claim that some task wasn't in the job description.
You should also consider what you will pay the assistant. Perform online research to identify salary levels for an administrative assistant with your desired level of experience.;
, Take your job requirements and use them to craft a well-written and informative job description. Now you can start seeking qualified applicants. Make use of any and all resources available to you when locating candidates, including your own social network and online job boards. Consider telling your coworkers or subordinates that you are hiring and asking them for suggestions. Reach out to your network on LinkedIn and ask for recommendations.

You can also consider using a recruiter to help you locate strong candidates., Sift through your applicants to find those who appear to be qualified for the position. Then, contact each candidate to set up an in-person interview. You can hold intermediate phone interviews if you have a large field of candidates. In either case, pay attention to the candidate's preparedness and communication skills. Look for attention to detail in their resume and check that they are polite to other employees when they come in for an interview.

Look for candidates who exceed expectations, either in their professional experience or during the interview.
Judge your own rapport with the candidate. Your assistant should have a personality compatible with your own.
Make sure they know how to operate any essential computer programs that your company uses. Watch them enter data into programs to make sure they know how to do it. For example, you can ask them to make a spreadsheet in Excel to see how they do it.
Contact their professional references and ask about their experience with the candidate., Contact the candidate that best meets your standards and performed well according to your hiring criteria. Extend a job offer to them, complete with a salary and any included benefits. If they accept, you can negotiate a start date and other details., For the first few weeks, you will have to guide your assistant in the specific ways that you like to get things done. Perhaps you have a previous assistant who is willing to train the new assistant. If not, you will have to take on the task yourself. Do not expect your assistant to read your mind.


Sit down with your assistant for a few minutes each day to help them sort mail and email. Show them what can be deleted, what can be saved, and where to sort different types of mail.

, Don't expect your administrative assistant to read your mind. While your assistant should be asking you questions about each task, you should aim to give them as much information as possible. Make sure that every task is adequately explained. Give them plenty of time to finish the task. If it is an emergency or a top priority, inform them right away that they should push back any other jobs.


Always indicate who, what, when, where, and why. Instead of saying, “I need you to take care of these travel expense forms,” say, “Please email accounting by the afternoon so that we can settle these travel expense forms.” After a while, your assistant may come to understand what you mean with vague directions, but at first, you should try to spell things out as clearly as possible.
Some people find it effective to give their assistant daily task schedules or checklists.If you have time to make a list every day, this might work for you.
Clarify when you need to be consulted and when a decision is in the hands of the assistant.

, Communicate which contacts are important and what kind of calls you are expecting. You should provide them a script so that they know the proper phone etiquette in your office. Inform them that they should not just read off this script but rather adapt it to their needs. This will ensure that your assistant is treating your clients and business partners in an appropriate manner.A script may read like “Hello, you have reached Joan Smith’s office. You are speaking to Lisa. How may I help you?”
Provide stock responses that they can use, such as “I’m sorry. Ms. Smith is unavailable at the moment. May I please take a message? I’ll have her call you back as soon as possible.”
You probably will not want your assistant to interrupt meetings or work with unimportant phone calls, but there are some people whose calls you will take no matter what. Make sure they have a list of these people.
Don't use assistant to place calls for you unless it is an emergency. Doing so can be very irritating to those who wait on you to answer the phone.

, When you first hire your assistant, let those who report to you know that the assistant will handling your calls, mail, or email. Let them know specifically which tasks they have authority over.You may choose to send an email out to your company welcoming your new assistant to the fold. You can say, “Lisa will now be handling all of my scheduling. If any of you need to meet with me, please contact her” or “Mark will be handling my email, so please do not be surprised if you receive a message from him.”

, This will give them a better idea of issues and daily activities within your company. They will become more informed about your responsibilities, and they will be able to provide advice and guidance on key projects. This will also send a message to other employees that you see the administrative assistant's role as a serious one.Be clear about your expectations for their role in meetings. Should they be listening, participating, or taking notes?

, Once your assistant has been trained, it may be tempting just to leave them alone. If you really want to get the most out of your assistant, however, you should encourage them to expand their skill set. You can:


Ask them to attend seminars
Provide training in new computer programs
Allow them to take on new tasks, including managing their own projectsSubsidize further education through a Continuing Education Program, Your administrative assistant can sort through your incoming mail and other correspondence to determine what is important and what does not require your attention. This will dramatically reduce the amount of incoming messages that you need to read yourself.


Make sure that you trust your assistant before handing over your email password.
Response templates, much like a form letter or memo, can help an administrative assistant handle routine tasks. A response template can be issued for customers' frequently asked questions, requests for donations or tours, reminders that reports are due, and other business items that may only require your signature.

, Your assistant can record any meetings, conferences, phone calls, or appointments you have scheduled. Furthermore, they should mark down any important project dates or quarterly deadlines. They should inform you of all new meetings, and you should let them know when you have made plans yourself.


You can use a shared calendar to help manage your schedule. An electronic calendar can upload your schedule to the cloud and notify both of you if there are any changes made by either party.
Be sure to inform them when you are planning to take vacations, travel for business, or go on medical leave so that they can help you organize your time effectively.

, If your assistant needs access to certain documents, templates, or forms, you should make them available as easily as possible. Create a dropbox or Google drive account that you both share. Upload all of the necessary documents. Your assistant can also upload important documents for you to look over and sign at your convenience. This will be a smoother process than sending emails back and forth.


Establish procedures for handling physical files, specifically in what types are to be kept, security measures, and storage.

, While you may have a precise way of doing things, you want to make sure that your assistant is productive in their own way. What works for you may not work for them. As long as the task is completed successfully, you should not nitpick how they finished the task. If they did something wrong, try to provide feedback that will correct the error.Do not require approval for every single task.For example, if your assistant is sorting your mail, they should not need your approval to throw junk mail away once they are trained. By doing so, you are taking up as much time as you might be saving.
As they become comfortable in their role, you can start giving them larger projects. Allow them to oversee certain programs. Give them an opportunity to manage something. Ask them to present at a meeting. This will increase their competence while allowing them to grow as an employee.
Don't just have your assistant run to get you coffee. Unless this is a two-way street (you can coffee from time to time), don't ask assistant to get coffee as part of their duties unless they volunteer to do so. Be very careful of gender stereotypes.
Remember that your assistant is intended to extend your capabilities, not act as a secretary or a servant. Treat them as a professional.

, At least once a year, sit down with your assistant for a formal meeting. Ask how your assistant has been doing. An assistant's duties have a tendency to change year by year. Make sure that your assistant knows what their duties are, and discuss any potential changes in their responsibilities in the upcoming year. Last, inquire about your assistant’s career goals. Are they happy remaining as an assistant? Or are they looking to take on other responsibilities in the company?Remember to maintain a professional distance from your assistant. Your relationship should be friendly but clearly boss-and-employee.
If you make them work unusual or long hours, consider promoting assistant to non-exempt status as a reward. However, don't do so to save money (getting them to work more hours for less pay).
Analyze a checklist of your administrative assistant's responsibilities. Ask whether certain tasks are necessary. See if there are areas of responsibility that can be downsized or if there are additional responsibilities to add.

, If you want everything to be processed smoothly, you should have a brief meeting with your assistant at least twice a day. In the morning, go over the plans and objectives for the day. Make sure to indicate which tasks have the highest priority. At the end of the day, discuss what happened and what did not get done. Plan an approach to solve any issues that arose.You may want to use a project management app such as Wunderlist or Trello to help you both decide what needs to get done that day. Your assistant can check off tasks as they complete them. You will be able to add tasks if they come up or mark certain tasks as priority. Cross-platform apps allow you to add a task on your device before automatically sending an update to your assistant.

, A common mistake some bosses make is to only criticize their assistant. Your assistant is human, and by giving positive feedback, you not only reinforce good practices but you encourage a friendly relationship. This will boost your assistant’s morale, increasing their productivity and yours.Positive feedback should focus on the assistant’s ability to complete tasks well. For example, “Good job on submitting those travel expense reports so quickly. You made my life much easier.”
Critical feedback should focus on ways that the assistant can improve. For example, “Next time, I will need you to submit those expense reports within a week of my travel. Don’t worry about it this time, but next time, I do expect you to get them in on time.”
Remember them on special days such as birthdays or Administrative Assistant's Day. , You should try asking your administrative assistant for ideas to improve the efficiency of your office as well as your productivity. After working for you for a few weeks, your assistant will have a good grasp on your habits, strengths, and weaknesses. Encourage your assistant to be honest, and reward good ideas. Do not dismiss or be offended by what they say. A fresh perspective may be just what you need.You can ask, “What is the best way for us to improve productivity? What do you see that can improved upon?”
If your assistant gives a good idea, praise them. You can say, “That’s a good idea. What can we do to put that into practice?”
If you don’t like their ideas, simply disagree and move on. You can say, “I’m not sure that would work here.”

, While you may be busy, you should not take out your anger or frustration on your assistant. Try to resolve conflicts as peacefully as possible. If you are concerned about your assistant doing something wrong, call them into your office. Inform them about what you are displeased about and tell them what they must to do to improve.


Be firm but not disparaging. For example, you can say, “You keep entering data incorrectly into the system. Please pay more attention to your task so that everything is done correctly.”
Ask them, “Why do you think this problem keeps happening? What do you need to improve?” Perhaps you give directions that are too vague, or maybe you are overloading them with work.
Your assistant should make you more productive, not less. If you cannot work effectively with your assistant, you may want to start looking for another one.

Bear in mind that all new legislation will be read and understood in different ways.",How to Write a Policy for Employment Law," New legislation is never written in plain English. It is always full of legal jargon and long-winded explanations. So, how can we make sense of it all?


Hire an external Human Resources consultant (often more cost effective than a solicitor) to translate the legislation for you. This is by far the easiest and quickest way of ensuring your organisation is ready to adhere to new legislation. They will also be able to write and implement a policy that will suit the individual needs of your organisation. This also gives peace of mind because all consultants should have insurance to give businesses advice.
Search the internet for as much information as you can find on the new legislation. Other companies may have published information in a straightforward format that is easy to understand. This can be very time consuming and you might find contradictory information. It can be very difficult to know what is right and relevant to your business.;
, New national legislation guidelines will always be printed in the media as well as reported on the news. This will give a correct overview of the legislation, however, it will only be published as the deadline date draws near, which may not give you enough time to prepare and implement a policy.

, People often take different views from the same thing. It may be that a similar business has picked up on a specific detail of the legislation that you missed, or vice versa. This form of benchmarking is very useful and helps to reinforce good relationships with like-minded businesses.

, A policy written for one business will not necessarily be suitable for all businesses. Your organisation’s structure and culture must always be taken in to consideration when writing a policy whether for legislation or best practice.

Understand that all TOGAF work follows through the ADM Cycle.,
Learn the outside of the ADM Cycle.,
Learn the Inside of the ADM Cycle, “Requirements Management”.,
Understand how to read the seven (7) past to the TOGAF Framework.,
Feel comfortable with Part I of the seven parts of TOGAF ""Introduction"": Essentially, the Part is used to say “Hey!,
Feel comfortable with Part II of the seven parts of TOGAF ""Architecture Development Method"": The core of activities in TOGAF is “Architecture Development Method Part II.” All other Parts are needed to complete Part II’s activities.,
Feel comfortable with Part III of the seven parts of TOGAF ""ADM Guidelines and Techniques"": ADM stands for Architecture Development Method or the name of Part II.,
Feel comfortable with Part IV of the seven parts of TOGAF ""Architecture Content Framework"": Architects will produce a number of outputs as a result of their efforts such as process flows, architectural requirements, project plans, project compliance assessments, etc.,
Feel comfortable with Part V of the seven parts of TOGAF ""Enterprise Continuum and Tools"": Essentially “Enterprise Continuum” means ‘whatever is done, try to generalize it so that it can be reused for a different project.’ Thus there is no 'recreating the wheel': TOGAF has several great guidelines in reusing as many things as possible.,
Feel comfortable with Part VI of the seven parts of TOGAF ""TOGAF Reference Models"": Two specific models are outlined in this Part.,
Feel comfortable with Part VII of the seven parts of TOGAF ""Architecture Capability Framework"": Part VII is all about the below diagram.",How to Use The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)," The ADM Cycle is hidden deep inside the framework but is how work progresses in TOGAF and an explanation of everything that is done throughout the TOGAF process.  Essentially this is a product development cycle. ADM stands for Architecture Development Method and is one of the 7 parts to a full TOGAF solution but is the part focused on how work is completed.;
, The middle of the ADM Cycle will be ignored in this step for simplicity. TOGAF starts at “Phase A: Architecture Vision” and ends at “Phase H: Architecture Change Management.”

Like all good IT management cycles, it repeats forever to make sure the solution stays current. Phase A is more business level and each Phase moves towards implementation. The product implementation maxes out around Phase E and then the rest of the phases turn the product into a full solution that can be used by customers in a reliable manner (change management, governance etc)

, TOGAF is all about governance. Every action needs to be approved and evaluated by peers. This middle circle is stating that the governance board monitors every action in the cycle and all required actions are taking place, The “ADM Cycle” described above is the main cycle of activity within TOGAF.  It does not describe the different attributes of these solutions and the unique features of TOGAF. Those are described in the Framework.


TOGAF is a library of information and tools to use through the ADM Cycle. Even though there are 7 “Parts” that does not mean they are synchronized. Instead, they are components to the end solution that are all needed at once to do TOGAF correctly. Note the Frameworks “Parts” are different than the ADM Cycle’s “Phases.” The ADM’s Phases are part of the components described in “Part II.”

, This is TOGAF”, This is where the previously mentioned Architecture Development Method (ADM) Cycle is defined., In other words, Part III is really a component to Part II. Part III contains several strategies to help make the Part II Architecture in different environments., How to create and use these outputs is defined in Part IV,, Technical Reference Model (TRM): The best way to describe the TRM is the below diagram. It is a collection of artifacts and activities to complete all necessary components to a solution to meet the topics addressed in this diagram.


The TDM is one of the two models discussed in Part VI. The other is the IIIRM, or the Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model (IIIRM). With the emergence of Internet-based technologies in recent years, for many organizations the main focus of attention, and the main return on investment in architecture effort, has shifted from the Application Platform space to the Application Software space. (Indeed, this has been one of the drivers behind the migration of TOGAF itself from a framework and method for Technology Architecture to one for overall enterprise architecture.) This section describes a reference model that focuses on the Application Software space, and ""Common Systems Architecture"" in Enterprise Continuum terms. This is the Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model (III-RM).

, In order to successfully operate an architecture function within an enterprise, it is necessary to put in place appropriate organization structures, processes, roles, responsibilities, and skills to realize the Architecture Capability. Part VII: Architecture Capability Framework provides a set of reference materials for how to establish such an architecture function. Readers should note that although this part contains a number of guidelines to support key activities, in its current form, the Architecture Capability Framework is not intended to be a comprehensive template for operating an enterprise Architecture Capability.

Review the plan on a yearly basis.",How to Use a Strategic Staffing Plan to Improve Human Resource Management," If you haven't updated your business plan in the last few years, then it is time to adjust it according to the position of the company. Whether you want to grow your business, introduce new products, segue into a new industry or reduce expenses for a recession, your managers should all be aware of the short-term and long term goals of the company.;
, If mid and upper-level management is filling in as HR when a position must be filled, it is unlikely you will be able to execute a strategic staffing plan. The HR manager should be able to assess the company's needs anew and develop a procedure for filling the position with the entire company, not just the department, in mind.


If you are hiring a new HR representative, ask for a strategic staffing qualification. You may need to pay a higher salary for someone who is experienced in HR strategy, but it may save you money in turnover in the long run.

, List the occupation, hours required, skills required and experience required. Keep in mind that your current staffing needs may be different than your original staffing needs, and the report should be based on the people you need to reach long-term goals.


An HR rep can conduct this kind of report by reviewing payroll, income statements, benefits, seasonal employment and turnover rates over the past few years. It may be a good idea to ask an outside consultant to report on the current staffing needs. An outside source may be able to use their distance from company culture to examine staffing outside of the current employees.

, In a separate document than the 1 outlining your needs, identify your current employees, their job descriptions and any foreseeable change in employment. For instance, if an employee will go on maternity leave, retire or begin full-time work, then it is worth noting.


Reviewing employees should involve reviewing whether their capabilities fit their current job titles and responsibilities. While creating a strategic staffing plan, people can be reallocated to a position that better fits their abilities or adapts to company changes.
Pay attention to overtime payments. A strategic staffing plan can address increases in payroll by adding part-time employees.

, Survey staff and meet with managers about the relationships, attitudes and changes in the company over the past 5 years. Decide if company culture is in a healthy place to reach long-term goals, or if improvements need to be made.


If improvements need to be made, try to outline whether they are improvements in morale, turnover, professionalism, personality, ambition or other qualities. The staffing decisions you make will need to reflect attitudes as well as abilities.

, After you have evaluated current needs and current staff, write a list of changes you would like to see in your workforce.

, Once you have analyzed the data on your current staff, you can begin to make changes that will inform HR decisions in the future.


Plan for workplace promotions. You will need to increase pay rates by 50 to 100 percent in order to take a low-level employee and promote them into mid or upper-level management in 5 to 10 years. If you have a problem with turnover, internal promotions and training may be an effective way to improve company culture and talent gaps.
Set up a seasonal employment process. If your income ebbs and flows during certain months, create a procedure for hiring people during a limited time. Give them incentives to do well at their job or possibilities to reward hard work with additional employment.
Reduce work-related injuries by increasing training or safety protocols. Set up strict rules for workplace safety and reward people for following them. If your business includes manual labor, this should be part of your strategic staffing plan.
Restructure your current positions in light of your long-term goals. Change is difficult for any company, but the sooner you adjust to fill gaps and reduce surplus, the more efficient you will be.
Don't be afraid to hire new people. If you need a social media guru, it may be better to get new ideas into the company than to train current marketing executives. While promoting from within can increase job satisfaction, filling vacated positions with new people may make your company more innovative. If many people are retiring, you may need to slowly train a younger workforce.
Consider increasing employee benefits. This is a good way to decrease turnover. Changes like health insurance, working from home, adding an employee gym or offering employee day care may improve company morale. Some benefits may be tax deductible.

, Changing everything overnight may upset positive company culture. Announce changes and goals while accepting comments, so that the company can feel as though they are involved.

, Once it is implemented, you will want to make sure that everyone supports and helps to manage the plan. If there is turnover in the HR department, other employees should be able to learn and implement the plan.

, A successful company will change regularly. Ask our HR manager to update the plan every year based on new needs, employees and market changes.

",How to Train New Employees," Unfortunately, the job of training is often assigned to those within the closest proximity to the new hire and to those with the most available time. It's imperative that the individual(s) providing the training have the necessary skills to be effective. Educating the trainer(s) is an important first step in successfully training new hires.
, A friendly, knowledgeable and positive co-worker can be a valuable resource person for the trainee, bridging gaps that all newly hired individuals experience., Provide or create a written training manual that contains specific instructions and reference information. It will be a valuable resource for the new employee and will hasten his/her success., It's the trainer's responsibility to create a non-threatening environment for learning. The most effective way to achieve that is to establish a relationship with the trainee. People skills are vital to establishing a relaxed and friendly learning environment. Take the time to engage in conversation with the newcomer, asking about his/her family, hobbies and interests, and don't forget to share your own. Professional business settings are comprised of human beings, so act like one...and treat the newly hired person as you would like to be treated., Allow the newly hired employee some latitude in setting the pace of learning new tasks, particularly when the training is provided by numerous employees who must perform their duties as well as train the new hire. In a busy, hectic environment, that is a huge challenge for all to overcome., Present the newly hired employee with a notebook that includes a comprehensive job description. It's a valuable assessment tool. Measuring progress based upon the job description builds the newly hired employee's confidence through affirmation of the trainee's accomplishments., Negativity is a roadblock to learning. Praise and positive feedback reinforce and affirm the efforts of everyone. Expect and provide positive interactions and feedback. There are no training shortcuts, therefore, allow time and repetition to bring the results everyone wants. Avoid the temptation to dictate and micro-manage the learning timeframe. Setting and expressing unreasonable timeframe goals are among the biggest roadblocks to the new hire success., As the trainee acquires the knowledge and skills to perform a complex task well, he/she will also gain confidence. Confidence is an empowering catalyst that enables the trainee to move on to mastering the next segment, accelerating the process., Put cross-training on the shelf until the trainee has accomplished a measure of success performing the duties outlined on his/her job description. Cross-training within a non-union employee pool in which there are disparities in pay is the name of the game in corporate businesses clamoring for the bottom line in this recessionary economy. Ethics aside, pay disparities legitimize potential claims and negatively impact employee morale. Spare the trainee from becoming politically embroiled in the subliminal conflict cross-training evokes in a non-unionized working environment., Grandma taught us that we catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. Keep that thought in mind when dealing with a new employee's errors. Coming down hard on a new employee who's attempting to learn what it's taken the rest of the staff months and years to learn impedes learning. It's counter-productive., Micro-management is the biggest deterrent there is to learning and productivity. Formal monthly evaluations of newly hired employees are unnecessary stressors that alienate. Like all micro-management tactics, it sends the signal of a lack of confidence in the trainee's capabilities. Micro-managing sends many trainees out the door!,"

Or your aim may be to deliver general information or guidance about a specific topic, such as painting or creative writing. Regardless of the focus, it's important to define the objective first.;
, When teaching a particular skill, for example, understanding the participants' needs in regard to skill level and learning pace will assist you in delivering appropriate content. The more you tailor the workshop to your audience, the more effective the workshop will be.

,


Create an introduction. Decide how you will introduce yourself, the topic and the participant members.
List the skills and/or topics you will cover. Create a comprehensive bulleted list. Include subtopics, as needed.
Decide on the order of the topics. Move the most important skills or information to the early part of the workshop. Depending on the subject of the workshop, it may also be useful to introduce and build on each topic, beginning with the simplest or most straight forward topic and concluding with the more difficult or complex topic.
Determine ground rules for the workshop. Rules or guidelines such as only one person speaks at a time, or raising a hand to speak, as well as shutting off any cellphones or distracting devices are good to establish at the onset of the workshop.
Decide how you will wrap up the workshop. You might include a short review of learned skills, announce the next level in a series of workshops and/or implement a participant feedback form.

, For particularly complicated topics or skills, allot a sufficient amount of time in case participants get stuck or have questions. It is also important to factor in scheduled breaks during the workshop to give the participants a chance to go to the bathroom or stretch their legs.

, Rehearsal is an important part of the workshop preparation process. Present your information to colleagues, friends or relatives ahead of time, and ask them to give you feedback on the clarity and effectiveness of your presentation.

, Convert your presentation outline into an agenda for participants and/or prepare hard copy handouts of important information or graphs.

, Presentation tools, movies, pictures and other elements may be useful in conveying particular concepts or skills. Choose visual tools that complement your presentation and do not distract attention away from your core message or objective.

, Open source learning programs like Moodle and Blackboard, which are free to use, can help to facilitate online discussions and postings outside of the workshop setting. These web based tools are also a great way for participants to submit homework or outside assignments online. More information on open source learning programs can be found here: http://blog.capterra.com/top-8-freeopen-source-lmss/

, Arrange the chairs in a horseshoe shape or a semi circle to facilitate conversation and post the ground rules on a board or wall where all participants can see them. Ensure a blank piece of paper on a board or wall, or a writing board, to brainstorm or document ideas and notes from the participants.

, Activities or games can increase engagement and participation. Activities may occur in small or large groups. Here is a list of 100 possible activities for a workshop: http://www.icaso.org/vaccines_toolkit/subpages/files/English/energiser_guide_eng.pdf

, Depending on the ground rules of the workshop, invite participants to ask questions either throughout the workshop or in scheduled time slots.

Keep records based on your observations.",How to Train Restaurant Employees," Perhaps the first step you’ll need to take in training restaurant staff is to hold an orientation. In an orientation, you or your trainers will present basic information about your business, your practices, and everything relevant to your staff's basic performance of their job. More specifically the orientation will include:


Human resource related information, payroll information, and any formalities staff will have to complete before they actually begin working.
Your restaurant’s history and philosophy. This should include your philosophy on customer service.
A brief tour of your restaurant's facility.
An introduction to your management and other key staff such as trainers.
An overview of the menu (and other services offered) and perhaps a tasting.
An outline of the training process.;
, After orientation, restaurant staff should begin the training process. In the training process, you or your trainers will instruct and educate new staff about important elements of their day-to-day work. Ultimately, instruction and education is the foundation of your employee's training and will provide them with the tools they need to go forward and succeed. This is your opportunity to focus on the particularities of different roles in your restaurant, including:


Food prep work.
Chef and cook work.
Bartending.
Dishwashing and busing.
Hosting and greeting.
Waiting.

, One of the best ways to teach your staff is to have them observe and assist the most experienced staff in your restaurant. This way, not only will your experienced staff be able to train and teach your new staff, but the new staff will be able to see common practices and less-used practices that your trainers might not typically teach them.


Pair your new staff with seasoned staff and have the new staff follow, observe, and assist the seasoned staff for a period of time.
The observe and assist period can last anywhere from a few days to a week or more.
Instruct your seasoned staff to go about their work as they typically do.
Instruct your new staff and the seasoned staff to engage in dialogue throughout the shift and at the end of the shift. New staff should ask as many questions as possible and seasoned staff should answer without hesitation.
If time permits, have them shadow employees in other important positions to give them a better understanding of how the whole restaurant team works., No one will be better able to understand what's most important for a new restaurant employee to know than your veteran staff members. Take advantage of their experience and talk to them about different and innovative ways of training new hires. Ideas can include:


Problems staff sees with current training programs.
Suggestions staff have for new training approaches.
Any other suggestions the staff has to improve organizational effectiveness., Give new restaurant employees training in all the positions in the restaurant. Have them spend time on the food line, behind the bar if legally permissible, with the dishwashers and working with the host or hostess to greet and seat diners. This will help them become more flexible in their duties and give them a better understanding of what it takes to run the restaurant successfully.

, While there will be a lot of important information to cover with your new hires, food and occupational safety should always take top priority. Emphasize these areas as they pertain to the new hires' positions and the restaurant as a whole. Review safety procedures and rules throughout the training process to ensure they're understood. Make sure to cover:


How to handle food.
How to store food and clean preparation items.
Safety precautions when using machinery or food preparation equipment.
The way to properly move around the restaurant (i.e. don’t run)., Train restaurant employees by setting a good example for them with your own behavior. As the boss, you're always being observed by employees, and new hires will especially look to you for the right way to conduct themselves. Keep this in mind when you work with other members of the wait staff, vendors and diners and conduct yourself courteously and professionally.

, Training should not stop soon after an employee joins your staff. In order to reinforce best practices, you should hold training sessions regularly. This will not only help your staff recall everything you’ve covered before, but will act as an opportunity to train seasoned staff in new techniques and approaches.


Use regular training events as an opportunity to train staff on new techniques and changes to your restaurant. This will be especially important if you have a menu change.
Use regular training events as an opportunity to bring in outside trainers who utilize different techniques than you have used in the past.
Use regular training events as an opportunity to retrain and refresh seasoned staff who are becoming set in their ways or even careless., Holding meetings with your employees – whether it be a group meeting or individual meetings – is one of the best ways to reinforce best practices. Meetings don’t necessarily have to address staff weaknesses or bad things. Use meetings as an opportunity to lead by example and to highlight what you want your staff to do to improve your business and the customer experience.


Focus on your staff’s strengths, and encourage them to live up to these strengths and emulate each other’s positive qualities.
Hold semi-regular group meetings every 2-3 months, at a minimum.
Hold one-on-one meetings with employees you think are falling behind. Use this as an opportunity to discuss performance evaluations and to encourage them to live up to their abilities.
Hold one-on-one meetings with employees you think are doing a great job. Talk about their good qualities and let them know that their work has been noticed.

, Reinforcing best practices is not just about training and teaching, it is also about recognizing your employees who do outstanding jobs. By recognizing these employees, you’ll send the message that you are paying attention and that their efforts are being noticed. Consider:


Recognizing your top employees at regular meetings.
Recognizing top employees in a private meeting.
Recognizing top employees through social media.
Giving top employees awards or cash bonuses., While you had your new staff shadow seasoned employees earlier in the training process, now it is time to watch your employees to see how they’ve internalized all of the training they’ve gone through. Spend some time every day watching or overseeing different members of your staff. When doing this:


Inform staff in advance that this might be done as part of a schedule or even randomly.
Don’t spend too much time. Fifteen minutes or less might suffice.
Consider positioning yourself at a central location to watch or shadow your employees.
To be less obvious, simply slow down your normal rounds of the restaurant. Walk slowly, greeting customers who are dining, and observing how your staff is interacting with each other and the customers., Mystery shoppers, diners, or customers are frequently used in the restaurant and retail industry as a way of collecting information about customer service and employee efficiency. In the restaurant industry, mystery diners are people who are employed to eat at a restaurant and evaluate the restaurants service, food quality, and overall experience without employees knowing that they are being evaluated. Mystery diners will give you important information about the efficacy of your training program and your restaurant's overall customer service.


Hire a third party business that specializes in evaluating businesses like your own. They will send mystery diners and then provide you with detailed feedback.
Have a friend or family member patronize your restaurant and evaluate it without your employees' knowledge.
Use mystery diners on a regular but random basis so you can continually gather feedback about your training success and customer service., Performance reviews are an extremely important way of tracking an employee’s progress toward becoming a valued member of your restaurant staff. When conducted by a manager or senior trainer or staff member, performance reviews can be used to evaluate everything from efficiency, attitude, customer service, and other strengths and weaknesses.


Consider conducting performance reviews or evaluations every 6 months to a year on seasoned employees.
Conduct performance reviews or evaluations on new staff members 1 to 3 months after they’ve completed training.
Rotate the senior staff and managers who conduct performance reviews on any one individual., While observations are extremely important, keeping records of your observations will help you when it comes time to implement staff changes and new training approaches. As a result, always keep well-organized records of everything having to do with your employee observations. Consider:


Logging tardiness and missed work.
Creating a file for each staff member and filing all relevant information there.
Take brief notes periodically about your employees' weaknesses and strengths. This might help when training comes around or when it’s time to discuss performance reviews."

Be respectful.,
Learn the definition of fairness.",How to Retain Good Employees," Good employees appreciate a boss who develops clear, thoughtful and well-defined goals, and knows how individual staff members will be best able to accomplish the tasks they lay out. For each objective, make sure you have put in writing:


The objective(s) (no more than three).
An estimated time frame for the completion of tiered objectives.
The process you wish them to follow in voicing their concerns and ideas relating to the goals.
Who will be responsible for what tasks.;
, Reward your best employees privately, or publicly, for conscientious work and positive results. Here are some low dollar cash/cash equivalent gift suggestions:


$5-$10 Fuel cards
$5-$10 Coffee gift cards
$10-$25 Dining gift cards.
$10-$50 Visa/Master Card gift cards.
1 share of company stock.

, Virtually anyone can be a good employee, provided their assets to the company are well understood, applied appropriately and volubly supported. Place employees in the best possible position for success by:


Allowing them to work their schedule without harassment, pressure to work overtime, or radical/late notice schedule changes.
Speaking well to them and of them, regardless of your mood.
Knowing what they have to offer your company and telling them about it as you focus them on your primary objectives.
Avoiding interpersonal comparative analysis.
Respecting individual's rights to privacy.

, Never assume that your best employee knows he/she is considered as such. Many excellent employees are so focused on the tasks at hand, they are not aware of how others, particularly their employer, see them. You must take care to nurture good employees and ensure that they hear, regularly, that you respect and appreciate them.

, A good employee takes tremendous pride in their work. Subsequently, they tend to brow-beat themselves when something they've done goes wrong. Take care not to over-burden your best employees when you spot a flaw. Minimize your reaction and the repercussions of their infrequent mistakes, and find ways to eliminate the cause of their mistakes, wherever possible.


Example: Suggest they play hooky the next day, if you see them looking downtrodden.
Example: If the good employee is overreacting to a mistake, remind him/her specifically of what an asset they are to your company, and assure them that the good work they do far outweighs a small mistake here and there.

, Employees don't instinctively ""see"" one another the same way you ""see"" them. At times, your worst employee may believe that they are in fact your very best asset. And while they may be a tremendous asset in their own way, you must take care to point out the best qualities of each individual and how their particular genius fulfills a company need. Placing the emphasis on the skills/talents of individual employees, rather than personality traits others might find distasteful, will keep you in a better position to defend and retain good employees who may not be the most popular in your business.

, If you're losing your best employees or can feel the tide beginning to turn against you, take a few minutes and ask them some questions. Here are a few ways to get them talking:


Ask how they are doing and if they're liking their work, so far.
Ask how their family is doing and if the money you're paying them is enough to keep them afloat.
Ask if they've been furthering their education or been thinking of a career change, recently.
Ask if they feel comfortable in their workspace.

, Say thank you at the end of each day; it sets the tone for how your evening, and your employee's evening will go. A simple thank you can make your best employee want to come back to work the next day, even if they were determined not to. Shake their hand when you encounter them and make good eye-contact when you thank them for their work; make them focus on what you are saying.

, If your best employee is leaving, there will be telltale signs. You can head off problems by being observant of their moods, the tone of their interactions with you, and their work style. A good employee is generally motivated by reward, but what reward they seek is highly individual. It would behoove you to investigate further if one of your good employees suddenly begins to treat you disrespectfully, turns in sloppy or careless work, or becomes sullen. If you cannot resolve the problem they're facing, help them move on to an employer who better suits their needs.

, Remember that you are the boss and act like it. Problem resolution is your issue, not an issue to be left to employees to work out for you. Take up the slack where you see it, cheerfully, but take care to maintain personal space as you go about your work.

, If you want to keep your good employees, be respectful of them. They wouldn't be your employee if you could do for yourself what they do for you. Keep your hands to yourself, unless shaking hands in greeting, and keep stray, non-work related thoughts out of your conversations with them. Good employees don't necessarily want to become a friend to you or their co-workers; they have goals and dreams and needs. As an employer, you should try to learn what their goals/dreams/needs are and make sure you are offering them what they need.

, Fairness is treating individuals appropriately based on their behavior, not treating everyone as equal. Take care to create individual solutions to individual's problems. Blanket statements, both good and bad, put a damper on good employees because it negates their extra personal efforts. Recognize the impact of saying ""You all did such a good job today!"" or ""We really need to pick up the pace, here, gang!"" While it is faster to speak to staff in generalities, the effect of such statements gives equal credit to all for the efforts of (potentially) a very few good workers, in the first instance, and negates the extra efforts of the good employees for the sake of inspiring the masses, in the second.

You will be able to create a more technical presentation for your managers than for other departments. However, you will want to present more financial data to stockholders than the people you manage.;
, Then, choose data and charts that illustrate your story. It will be easier to give your presentation from memory if it has a beginning, middle and conclusion.


Adjust your story for an executive audience. Your story should give background on a problem, then present a solution. At the beginning, explain a problem that your presentation will solve. Instead of using flowery speech, get to the point more quickly.

, Unless you are extremely good with off-the-cuff presenting, you will want to work off of a detailed script for an important presentation. As you get to know your material more, you can change it to make it feel more natural.

, If possible, present your data in the form of charts and graphs and make large copies of marketing documents. Make a slide show to form a seamless visual with your presentation, adding in keywords that you want your audience to remember as you go through the material.

, Even if you don't use the data, have it available during your presentation. It's likely that executives will ask to see supplementary information.

, You can present it to an empty room or a team member, but be sure to time your presentation so you know how long it is.

, In fact, you may find yourself able to cut extraneous phrases and slides to streamline your message. Be sure to leave time at the end of your presentation for discussion and questions.


One study asked executives what made presentations successful, and they said they wanted them to be ""short and candid.""

, You should be able to stop the presentation for discussion and resume it, if need be. Practice until you are confident that you can give it without looking at cards or slides.

, You will have a chance to set up and ensure there aren't technical difficulties with visual aids. Being early will increase your confidence and look professional.

, This will show you are comfortable and confident about the information you are presenting.

, Take notes on what worked well and what can be stronger, so you can repeat your success and improve.

Measure whether the plan has accomplished its objectives.",How to Set Up an Employee Assistance Program (EAP)," If you know another business owner, you can ask them who they use for their EAP. Ask whether they would recommend the provider and take down the contact information.;
, Google “EAP service provider” and your location. Check to see if any providers are located near you.One benefit of checking online is that you can immediately scroll through the provider’s website to see if they offer the services you want.

, The Employee Assistance Society of North America (EASNA) is a trade association of EAPs. They have an online directory you can use to search for an EAP provider in your area: http://employeeassistancedirectory.org/.

, An EAP can provide help with many different employee problems. Make sure that any EAP you think of hiring offers the services you are looking for. Consider the following:wellness program
crisis counseling
stress management
referrals for child care or elder care

, EAPs can also provide managerial or supervisory services, which you may find attractive. Find out what the EAP offers and consider whether you need the following:supervisor education and training
help with referring employees to the EAP
guidance on work performance review and discipline
support with implementing return-to-work policies or worker accommodation
management consulting
analysis of business team dynamics

, Some EAPs provide services to support the entire organization or to smaller units in the organization. They may provide the following services:crisis event planning (such as for a natural disaster or violence)
company-wide educational programs
work with unions
coordination with other benefit programs and services
risk management
disability management

, Some EAPs also provide your business with key administrative services. Consider whether you want these services, such as the following:account management
customer service
website development
budgeting
professional development
staffing
creation of other policies and procedures
quality assurance

, Check how long the provider has been in the business and how long they have been serving their current clients. Also ask for a list of references.Be sure to call the references and ask what the companies like about the EAP and what they don’t.


Also ask if the reference has used another EAP before and how they compare.

, You’ll want EAP counselors to be available when your employees need them. Be sure to check when services are made available. For example, ask the following questions:How many staff members are available during typical business hours?
Can employees access the services after normal business hours?
Which services are made available after business hours?
How fast are telephone calls answered?
What is the call abandonment rate?How many free counseling sessions are available for employees?

, EAPs employ counselors for assessment and short-term counseling. You should ask about their credentials, such as the following:What educational credentials do they have? Many programs have counselors with at least a masters-level degree in social work or psychology.How many counselors are provided per employee?
Are counselors certified?
How many years of experience do counselors have?

, Figure out if you like how your employees can contact the provider. For example, must they call a toll-free number? Or will the provider have someone on-site who can meet with employees?Many younger workers today are much more comfortable with technology. If you have a young workforce, check whether the EAP offers online assessments, text messages, and support through email., Generally, EAP counselors provide only short-term consultations. They refer your employees to someone else for long-term treatment. Find out how the provider makes referrals.For example, how did they create their referral list? How often is it updated?
How does the EAP assure the quality of services provided by the referred professional? Do they review and monitor continuing treatment?
How does the EAP coordinate with insurance benefits when making referrals?Does the EAP or a parent company have a financial interest in any program or facility in which it makes referrals?

, A good EAP should offer workshops on topics related to employee mental and physical health. Check what kinds of workshops the EAP offers. Also ask if you can watch a sample workshop.


Younger, more tech-savvy employees might prefer to watch a podcast or a webinar.Make sure the provider delivers workshops in a way that works for your employees.

, Once you’ve narrowed down your list, you should ask each EAP how it charges you. You may need to submit a Request for Proposal (RFP). There are many different fee arrangements, such as the following:The fee might be tied to the level of use. If your employees use the service rarely, then your bill will be low. However, you might find it hard to budget for your EAP since you won’t know ahead of time how much you’ll pay.
You might pay a flat fee. Regardless of how much your employees use the program, you pay the same amount. A flat fee can make budgeting easy.
You might pay based on performance. This pricing strategy is rarely used. You and the EAP agree to tie payment to a set of metrics, such as employee satisfaction.

, To implement the EAP, you should create a company policy. You can find sample policies online. Also remember to revise other company policies to reflect the presence of the EAP. For example, your EAP is a resource for handling any of the following:progressive discipline
sick leave
disability management
claims of employment discrimination

, You should tell employees about your Employee Assistance Program during new employee orientation. Your EAP may also have a brochure you can distribute to new employees.


Also put the information in a new employee manual or handbook. This way, they can refer to the information later.

, Put posters in all break rooms or in the hallways where employees will see them. Make sure the poster has the phone number or other contact information for the EAP. Call your EAP, who may have posters you can use.

, A key factor for your EAP’s success will be how management speaks of the program. Remember to always speak positively and remember to emphasize the following:The EAP is not a resource of last resort.
No problem is too small for the EAP. Encourage employees to seek assistance as soon as possible.
You’ve used the EAP. If management acknowledges that it has received help, then it can remove some of the stigma employees might have about receiving help for stress or mental health issues.

, Some employees may be understandably nervous about sharing personal or work-related problems with an EAP counselor. They may fear that the counselor will report back to their boss. You should explain to employees that their use of the program is confidential.


Continually remind your employees that the EAP does not keep an external record of their using the program, and what they share is confidential.Also emphasize that employees don’t need to ask anyone’s permission to use the program. They simply need to call a number or stop in and ask for help.

, As an employer, the EAP helps you as well. If an employee is suffering from substance abuse or another addiction, you can refer the employee to your EAP to get help. Encouraging an employee to seek treatment can make your employee happier and more productive.


Sometimes, you might need to make visiting the EAP a requirement if the employee wants to keep their job. For example, if an employee has a violent outburst, you might make attendance required.
You might also schedule a meeting with an EAP counselor if you don’t know how to discipline an employee. The counselor can help you deal with expected reactions from your employees.

, You may have adopted an EAP for a particular reason. For example, you might have adopted it to speed-up the return of injured workers to the job or to reduce absenteeism.You should assess whether the program has achieved its intended result and, if not, find out why.


Check whether employees are using the program. Your EAP provider should maintain statistics on usage, and can provide you with a report on request.You won’t know who has used the program, but you can know how often it has been used. Increase the program’s visibility with your employees if it isn’t being used enough.

Maybe you want a retreat that will build unity among your staff. Alternatively, maybe you want a retreat where you brainstorm new ideas for your company. Another option is a retreat meant to train your employees in new skills. Whatever you choose, that will determine how you plan your retreat.Other purposes could include bringing people at long distances together or encouraging all employees to have a stake in planning what's ahead for the company.You may find that you need different kinds of retreats at different times. For example, you may need team-building retreats when you're first starting a company or when you have a large turnover, while later on, you may need a retreat that focuses on dealing with the changes in your company.;
, Before you can really plan your retreat, you need to decide exactly how much you'll be able to spend on it. That includes room and board and travel expenses. You also have to think about how long you want the office to be shutdown (if at all), as well as how much time employees will devote to preparation for the retreat. Consider all these factors when drawing up your budget., If you want people to get something from your retreat, they need to be invested. Take suggestions from employees about what kind of retreat would work best and what needs to be talked about at the retreat. If they have a say in what goes on, they'll be more likely to participate.Try sending out an email asking for suggestions. You can also have an anonymous suggestion box about the retreat.
Another option is to send a question out to all employees. Have the answers sent to the facilitator. For instance, you could ask, ""What will make this retreat a success?""

, It may be tempting to just have a retreat in your office to help save money. However, that usually isn't enough of a break from the day-to-day to really be effective. Pulling people out of their routine can help generate new ideas and new relationships.Even if your company doesn't have a large amount of money to spend on a retreat, you can still help move your employees out of the office. For example, you could rent a room at a local library or even have it at nearby park pavilion if the weather is nice. Another option is to ask clients to use spaces they have available.
If you have more money, the sky is the limit. You can isolate yourself away in some woodsy location or go for something more exciting, such as Las Vegas.

, When looking at a location, make sure to check into the details. It needs to have a place where you can all work together. It needs to have fast internet if you're planning to work on your computers, along with places to plug in. You'll also need access to good food, even if it's just to order in. Plus, it doesn't hurt to have a nice background, so it really does feel like a retreat, rather than just more work., You may think you can run the retreat yourself, and you may be right. However, outside help can be useful. Facilitators can come from within your company, if your company is big, such as from the HR department or another department that has little interaction with your own. Alternatively, they can be from an outside consulting firm.The facilitator should be an expert in group dynamics, not in your field. The facilitator will help guide discussions, facilitate decisions, and encourage teamwork. A facilitator can also help you plan the retreat and decide on a goal and schedule for the retreat. In addition, the facilitator acts as an official recorder of the event, so you know what was said.Having a facilitator allows you to actually participate in the retreat, rather than just run it. It can also help if you have office in-fighting, and you're using the retreat to solve those issues. A facilitator may be better equipped to handle a large group, particularly if your retreat will have more than 20 people.
In addition, a facilitator can help generate new ideas in ways you may not be able to. That is, you work with your employees on a regular basis, so they will respond in predictable ways to you. Having someone new can help create a different atmosphere with your employees, opening them up to more participation.

, On a retreat, you can have food catered by the hotel or an outside caterer. You can let people get food on their own with a daily stipend, or you can even encourage team building by having nightly cookouts. Whatever way, you need to plan ahead of time.Make sure to meet the dietary needs of your employees. Have both healthy options and not-so-healthy options available, as well as vegetarian and gluten-free options available, if that's appropriate.
If you're serving alcohol and have hired bartenders, make sure you have enough staff on hand to serve drinks. Also, make sure everyone has a safe way home if there's driving involved.

, One way to help facilitate better discussion at a retreat is to provide them with informational videos or presentations ahead of time. That way, they can read up on the information on the plane or at work and be ready to get down to discussion at the retreat., How long your retreat is will be based on several factors. One, of course, will be how much money you have to fund a retreat. However, how many workdays you want to give up will also limit how long you want the retreat to be. A retreat can be as short a single day or as long as a week, depending on what you want to accomplish at the retreat.For example, a team-building retreat can be accomplished in one day, but more involved retreats, such as those looking to change the direction of the company, will need more time.

, You've decided on a main goal, now break that down into smaller problems. Keep in mind that you don't want to overschedule. Let your employees have the time they need to work on each problem instead of shortchanging each task, leaving you with half-finished solutions., You should have the day scheduled out so your employees know what to expect. Try not to start it too early, as it is a retreat. Have time scheduled for discussion sessions and presenters, as well as time scheduled for meals and breaks.Be realistic about mealtimes. If you're providing all the food, an hour at lunch may be reasonable. If you're not and you're in a new city, you may want to allow more time for your employees to find lunch and get back.
Remember to schedule down time. Not everyone has the mental energy to be ""on"" with co-workers all day, everyday, even into the night. Some people need alone time to recharge., If you want certain topics covered, you need to know ahead of time who will make those presentations. You can have outside consultants come into make presentations or to teach new skills, but you can also have employees present information on their departments or current projects. Schedule those presenters into the program, keeping in mind what's most important to have upfront., When you're planning your retreat, your employees need to be informed of all of the travel details well in advance. A month is the minimum, but longer is ideal. You also need to decide how employees will get where you're going, and how they will be reimbursed. For instance, if you're flying, you can allow employees to schedule their own flights, and provide them with a company credit card or reimbursement after the fact.Send the details in multiple formats, including email and a physical packet. Also have information posted around the office.

, A working retreat is an opportunity to move away from all the banalities of day-to-day life at work. It's an opportunity to step back and look at the bigger picture. Don't waste the time focusing on the small details. Pull back and focus on moving your company forward.One way to focus on the larger picture is to talk about the 3 Ws. That is, focus on who you are as an organization, what you do as an organization, and why you do it.

, If the goal of your retreat is to make important decisions about the company, how those decisions are made should be decided up front. The participants should know, for instance, if decisions will be made by a majority vote.Also, participants should know whether they are making recommendations to leadership or they are making decisions leadership will abide by. It can undercut the work you do at the retreat if participants think leadership will abide by their decisions, and then leadership chooses to implement only certain parts.

, The discussion should be open to everyone who is at the retreat, not just leaders. If you only want certain people to have a say, that's who you should bring on the retreat. Don't bring people along just to mute their opinions.One way you can make it more open to everyone is to hand out similar paper and markers. Then people can write down ideas on paper to help generate discussion.
You can also have the facilitator encourage people to talk who haven't yet said much at the retreat.

, That is, you may want to focus on generating new ideas for the company, but even so, you can spend time building up your team. Throw in some team-building exercises on the side to help encourage people to work together and get to know one another.Team building can be a part of the work. That is, when working on a problem, encourage people to work together to solve it.

, Whatever the goal of your retreat is, it's also a time for people to get to know each other. Make sure you build in time away from the computers, when people can eat together or catch a show together. If you're off in the woods, make mealtimes a chance for everyone to get together and cook., At retreats, just like at any meeting, it can be tempting to go off on tangents. However, it's important to stay on topic as much as possible. One way to help the group stay on topic is to save other ideas for later. If someone starts going off on a tangent, write it down, and come back to these saved ideas later in the day., Smaller groups can sometimes attack problems more effectively. If you're working on a large problem or project, break into more manageable chunks, and let individual teams work on each part. That way, more people have a say in the end result., If the goal of your retreat is to implement new strategies or to solve a problem, you can't just come up with ideas. You need actionable steps for how it will get implemented when you get back to your office. Assign tasks to individuals or teams, and let them come up with a plan for how it will work at the office. You should also create deadlines, in conjunction with the person or team, for those plans., Part of the facilitator's job will be to summarize and evaluate what went on at the retreat. Within a week, you should receive this evaluation, and you should be able to pass on any appropriate analysis to your employees. The report should focus on what went well but also what can be improved in the future."
"
Look at the workplace culture.,
Get to know all of your employees.,
Consider the principles of ""Servant Leadership"".,
Genuinely care about your coworkers and employees.,
Focus on team-building.,
Cross-train and build knowledge across different functional areas.,
Have the management candidates conduct interviews, create presentations, sit in lieu of you in important meetings and take on more of a personal assistant role while you groom them for larger tasks.,
Make sure your manager in training isn't thrown to the wolves.,
Lastly, have your management candidate learn valuable lessons in managing upwards.",How to Train Management Candidates," It may seem like a retroactive step, but grooming a candidate for management requires a look in the mirror. Are there any obvious signs of demoralization? If so, pay attention to and investigate the employees' concerns. People are simply more productive when they are happy and feel valued. Get to know your team and encourage an open door policy.


Make sure management candidates get to see supportive approaches and team spirit exemplified by you. Project humility and a willingness to support.
Make sure that your management candidate gets to see what a true open door policy looks like.;
, In turn, evaluate each person on a composite level, strengths, weaknesses and all other relevant competencies. Try to make sure that your employees have the equipment, means and time to do what they need; find out what is needed by being supportive and listening carefully.


Help your management candidates attain growth in areas that they struggle in, while tasking them with things they are uniquely gifted for. 
Allow your management candidates to give feedback on how operational goals might be better met. It may save the company time and money and will give the employee a sense of ownership, satisfaction and pride. Show your management candidates how you do this every day.

, Allow plenty of time for collaborative problem solving between peer employees. Cultivate a culture where employees can be part of the solution to the organizational challenges that you face. If something needs improvement, let an ad hoc committee be formed to help make that happen, or at least create a research framework.


Let your new management candidate try their hand at solving a problem, such as getting budget approval for new equipment, or streamlining a work process.

, Congratulate them on their successes and console them in their grief. Managing people is all about relationships, and a management candidate that wants to succeed should see a real leader at work.

, If some employees are not getting along, take them all out for lunch with margaritas or a bonding event that is not forced. No koosh ball or trust falls, but just a break. When the tension in the room is so thick that one could slice it with a knife, no real work is getting done. Take that time for team-building.

, Management can be overwhelming, but having a bit of knowledge here and there will help your management candidates develop contacts from the bottom up, top-down and a more cohesive idea of how the company is fundamentally run. Even more importantly, knowing who to contact about what is something that takes years for some employees in larger, more bureaucratic organizations. Relationships, again, are key to solving problems and getting key information. More often than not, that knowledge will come from below, and people will more readily respect a neophyte manager who cares about them. More people respect that knowledge was earned from the bottom to the top, with a willingness to get their hands dirty and pitch in than just having an MBA.

, This will help them to develop analysis, requirements gathering, presentation and other managerial skills.

, They need to know how to set up new user logins, develop staff, create SOP's, lead employees, and if they can do that, they will make you look good. Your new manager, protégé, what have you, is your fruit. If you cannot churn out good people to replace you, you cannot, and you will not, be promoted. Make sure you set everyone who could fill your shoes next up for success, no matter what your job is, because people will always remember what you did for them, or didn't do for them. Ultimately, as a manager, your job is to cultivate talent, develop employee potential and assist in facilitating human resource development. If you leave your protégé stranded, you have missed the whole point of management.

, It's hard to truly be successful without having the team backing you. Help them create meaningful relationships with people that will be directly reporting to him or her, to the people he or she will be reporting to or by finding ways to focus on common problems and solutions. Soft skills are hard to come by, but a bit of coaching on potential pitfalls can keep you, your new hire and your department looking ace.

Some companies require recreational activities be reported to corporate for tracking purposes. This is particularly common in large companies where different departments or locations may get jealous of what goes on in your location.


Speak to your local human resources officer if you are unsure where to check for company policies.
Some companies prefer that you report these types of events because they can aid in recruitment.;
, Depending on the industry your company is in, there may be busy and slower periods in your schedule. Manufacturing tends to be busiest near the end of the month to fill orders, whereas retail businesses may have sales, events or inventory-counts to schedule around.You should schedule your employee appreciation day during one of the slower output periods of time to alleviate stress caused by missing work or impending deadlines.
You may want to plan your employee appreciation day for soon after a particularly busy period of time.
Come up with a few possible dates to use when presenting the plan to managers, supervisors or human resources.

, Your budget will dictate how you proceed in planning your employee appreciation day. You will need to consider how many employees will be participating in the day’s festivities and whether or not you are going to open the event up to their families. Determine how many people you anticipate will be coming to the event so you can get a sense of how much food you will need and begin to ballpark financial figures.If you have a budget set before you begin, you can use that to guide your decisions about whether or not to invite families.
Food is an important part of an employee appreciation event, but remember to keep room in your budget for entertainment like music or activities.

, Once you have an idea of your budget and when you’d like to throw the employee appreciation day, meet with team leaders within your building or department to discuss the possible dates and any suggestions they may have.Offer the dates you have determined and ask managers if they have a preference for one of the dates based on the requirements of their teams, then try to choose a date that best suits everyone.
Tell managers that you are open to suggestions if anyone has an idea as to things they would like to see included. If you allow them to participate in the process they will be more apt to ensure their teams can attend.

, When meeting with managers, you may want to suggest putting together a team to help you put the employee appreciation day together. You can ask for members of each group so everyone is well represented, or you can choose a few people that you know are good at organizing these kinds of events.


Human resources officers and people that work in marketing may be well suited and willing to assist. Employee morale programs fall within the purview of most human resources professionals and marketing may have experience organizing events.
Consider allowing anyone to participate that shows an interest, provided it does not interfere with their formal responsibilities.

, With the preliminary work out of the way, you will need to determine a solid date that you intend to have the employee appreciation day. This is important, as you will need to give the date to businesses and vendors, as well as advertising the date internally to your employees.The date will need to be established early on in order to get price estimates from local businesses for food and similar expenses.
Employees may need to plan their work schedule to allow for a day of festivities. The more time you give them to prepare the more likely they will be able to attend.
Make fliers and send out e-mails to let employees know the date, time and location of the employee appreciation day as soon as you have the date set.

, Depending on the size of your company and the number of people you anticipate participating in the employee appreciation day, the types of activities that are appropriate for your event can vary widely. The time of year and venue are also important to consider. Some good examples may be:Outdoor activities like volleyball or softball may be appropriate for some groups of people during warmer months.
If you have the budget, inflatable play areas for children and adults can often be rented for indoor or outdoor use.
Raffling off prizes can be done in any location at any time of year and can add an element of excitement.

, It is important that you are sensitive to the dietary needs of your employees if you intend to let them know that you appreciate them. You should have vegetarian alternatives and be aware of religious concerns that may come into play. If you are going to order a number of pizzas, you may want to put out a signup sheet asking people to list what they would like. If you intend to have the event catered, discuss the options you have available to you with the catering company. You may also want to consider making a “pot-luck” style event in which each employee is asked to bring in one dish to share with their coworkers.Muslim employees cannot eat during the day while observing Ramadan and cannot eat pork at any time.
Some Christian employees may not be able to eat meat on Fridays during lent.
You may want to offer a variety of vegetarian and dairy free options to ensure everyone can have a tasty meal during your event.

, One way to reduce costs and get the most out of your budget is to contact local businesses and bring up the opportunity of partnering with them on the event. You could offer to advertise local businesses at your employee appreciation day in exchange for discounted catering services, rented activities, or housekeeping after the party.If your business also offers products or services local companies may benefit from, you could offer discounts in return.
Some companies may be eager to participate simply to have an opportunity to engage a new potential customer base in your employees.

, Purchase all of the materials you will need for the party early to ensure you aren’t surprised by budget limitations the day before the festivities. Decorations can be important, as they can help set the mood of the day and make a workspace look more festive.


Hanging up streamers and balloons can be a great way to make a regular workplace look festive and fun.
Make sure to buy plastic cutlery, paper plates, and cups if they will not be provided by a catering service.
If you plan to have a raffle, make sure to buy quality products as prizes. A handful of good raffle prizes like gift cards or electronics can be more exciting than a dozen small, cheap prizes. Ask partnered businesses if they would consider providing things for the raffle.

, It’s going to take some serious work to decorate for your employee appreciation day, set out the food, and organize any activities. Remember that the point is not to give your employees additional work to do, but it’s important that you get some help setting things up before the event begins. Ask for volunteers or choose a small team to help you.


Make sure to credit those who helped prepare for the event during the festivities.
You may want to offer an incentive for those who help set the party up like allowing them to leave early the day prior.

, At the onset of the employee appreciation day, you should address the group and let them know why you are throwing such an event: to let them know how much you appreciate their hard work. You may choose to share stories about individuals that have gone above and beyond the call of duty or discuss recent successes you have experienced as a group.Leave out any lingering concerns you or the team may have. Employee appreciation days should be about what’s going well, not what needs to go better.
Emphasize how much you personally appreciate your employee’s hard work.

, After you address the employees and explain why you are having an employee appreciation day, try to steer conversation with individual employees away from work. Allow them to enjoy their day instead of treating it as an extended staff meeting.Don’t bring up things you need done to employees unless you expect them to leave the event to do it.
Only ask an employee to work during an employee appreciation event if it is absolutely imperative to the success of the business and make sure they are aware that you appreciate their sacrifice.

Research your options.,
Decide what experience you want to give your website visitors.,
Decide what you need from the backend of the CMS.,
Test drive each programming platform.,
Check if your web hosting service automatically installs any of the open source CMS.,
Read community reviews of the open source CMS or extensions you want to install.,
Choose a CMS according to website functionality and employee functionality.",How to Select an Open Source Content Management System1," A quick Internet search will tell you that WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, Plone and Blogger are probably the most common; however, there are dozens more. Make sure you are testing a CMS, rather than a vendor, as the names may be easily confused in the beginning.


Many online reviews say that WordPress CMS is good for blogs, and Drupal is great for community-oriented sites, with a lot of user interaction. Joomla! works well for the most basic websites and users. Plone is a newer CMS that manages documents and community very well. You should make your own decisions based on what looks best for your site.;
, Sit down with your marketing or branding department and make a list of the essential parts of a website, so that you can look for them in your CMS. This will help you to choose the frontend designs you prefer.


You can also get a private web development company to design your template and plug in an open source CMS. This is considerably more expensive than simply choosing a ready-made design through an Internet-based service. It may allow you extensive customization of your site.

, For example, decide if you need search engine optimization (SEO) features, mailing lists, events applications, customization, scalability or a specific programming language.

, Assign 2 to 3 people who will be working with the programs most to do a trial run, or ""sandbox"" version, of the CMS. They should report back with reviews and rate them according to overall preference.


Open source CMS can all be installed for free. You may need to hire a web programmer to install them, if no one in your organization is very computer savvy. You still want to test the backend of the system with the non-technical users.
You can also go to opensourcecms.com to try over 70 open source CMS programs for free. The site will allow you to do a demo without having to install the whole program.

, If you use shared server hosting, then the tech support you pay for may include installation of 1 of these programs. If so, and you like the program, you can save money that would otherwise go toward hiring a programmer.

, Each open source program has a web-based community that helps users ask and answer questions. You can get an idea of how easy it will be to accomplish the things on your marketing list by searching for reviews and instructions.

, Compare each CMS/template with the frontend/backend list you made. Choose the program that fulfills the most preferences on your lists.

You may also want to approach some people personally.People are not always quick to volunteer, but a personal invite might have more traction, especially if you emphasize the specific skill that you wish to utilize by selecting that particular person.
Some people are good at organizing details, while someone else might be particularly good at baking tasty treats for the party. If you have someone in mind that you specifically want to ask to help, try saying something like, “John, I was really impressed with the way you helped organize the activities at our last function. I was wondering if you might consider helping in the same way for our upcoming event?”;
, At this meeting, you should divide the various steps into committees, such as venue, food, entertainment, and decorating. Assign each committee a leader who you feel is the most capable out of your volunteers. Each leader should then pick a team, of at least one other person, to assist them from the remaining volunteers.During the meeting, discuss ideas from each committee to get the teams motivated and thinking of their approach.
Before ending the meeting, arrange a date and time for the next meeting and request that each committee offer a status report.

, You delegated the tasks so you didn't have to get lost in the shopping end of these areas, but you have to take part in the decision making process – especially when it comes to choosing and buying.Get involved with all the committees, and remain in charge of the budget.
Make sure each committee runs costs by you before making any purchases.
Let committee members handle the small stuff, but make sure they know to consult you on all larger decisions.

, Have these meetings until the date of the company function. Arrange for one of those meetings to be at the chosen location so that all the committees can make sure that their part of the plan works in conjunction with the event as a whole.For example, the decoration crew needs to know the size and structure of the venue to make sure they select appropriate decorations, and the entertainment committee needs to check out the venue before making a final decision on the entertainment selection.
Make sure everyone is on schedule and pulling their weight. Be ready to help with issues and decision making solutions.
Try to settle on the date, time, and location so you can work on getting the word out about the event.

, Consider what goals you want to accomplish for the business by hosting this event. Is the purpose to draw in more clients? Or maybe your goal is to develop stronger relationships with business partners. Whatever the reason, it’s important that you have it in mind from the beginning so that you can keep this goal as the motivating factor whenever you make decisions about the event.Your business goal should be something specific and measurable instead of something vague. For example, a reasonable event goal might be to increase business investors by 20%.

, This is one of the most important steps in planning an event for your company because the location will really set the tone for the whole event. Consider the scale of your event – will it just be the people in your small office, or will the event be catering to an extended business crowd?Depending on the size and scope of the event, you may be able to host it at your workplace. If you have a large conference room, this could be a cost-efficient way to plan the event.
But if you are inviting many people to the event, you should look into reserving a conference center or events center. Many hotels have these kinds of locations available for booking.
Consider the acoustics of the room. If you will have a large group, you’ll probably need a microphone for the speaker and you don’t want the sound to echo terribly because of poor sound acoustics.
Make sure the venue fits in your budget for the event, while still allowing enough for the other expenditures.

, Once you have chosen the venue, you’ll need to start considering who to invite. Make sure you don’t invite more people than the venue can comfortably hold. You don’t want your guests to be crowded or uncomfortable.The venue employees will be able to tell you what the maximum occupancy is for the venue.
Be sure to keep the business purpose in mind when considering what guests to invite. You want to invite people who will contribute to the successful outcome of the event and support your cause, not people who might hinder that goal.

, Once you know how many people you will be inviting, you can start planning for the food. You need to figure out what kinds of food you want to serve and how much of it to get for the event. These considerations largely depend on what time of day your event will be held.


For example, if your event is at 7pm, your guests will probably expect you to provide food for them and they probably won’t eat dinner before the event. In this case, you’ll need to supply an entrée, some sides, and a dessert, as well as some beverages.
If your event begins at 8am, it would be good to offer coffee and juice along with some croissants or doughnuts.

, If you decide to invite a keynote speaker to your event, make sure that whoever you choose is somehow related to your business, your product, your company’s ideology, or the purpose of this event.Make sure the speaker’s cost is within the budget for your event.
Try to speak directly with several options for keynote speakers so that you can get a better idea about which one would be the best fit for your event.

, In order to stay on budget for the event, you’ll need to assess how much money you can spend and subtract a substantial contingency fund. Then the rest is what you have to spend on the event.No event will ever go 100% smoothly. There will usually be some minor (or large!) mishap that ends up costing additional, unexpected money. It is important to plan ahead for this and to be prepared with a backup contingency fund.
Depending on the size of the event, the contingency fund could range from a couple hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.

, In order to attract corporate sponsors for your company event, you’ll need to come up with a proposal request that piques their interest. Sponsoring your event must be beneficial to the sponsor in some way – like it will give their organization more media coverage.Your proposal should include the reasons why they should sponsor your event, demographic details for the event/organization, the actual dollar amounts you’re requesting,

, To get the turnout you want for your event, you might want to consider promoting it on social media. You could create a Facebook event and invite people that way. You could also tweet about it from your company’s Twitter account. All of these are great ways to spread the word about your company’s upcoming event. , Make sure you have a committee for invites and responses, and suggest they create a spreadsheet with guest list information.This will allow you to keep track of who is planning to attend and get a headcount for the things you’ll need to plan for – like how many refreshments or company swag to purchase for the event.

, In this meeting, you should review all the committee decisions, guest list, and budgets requirements. Take this time to iron out all the final details.Be sure to include time at the event for networking because this is a very important aspect of company events.

, Sponsors are the people who made your event possible, so you’ll need to treat them appropriately. This means possibly inviting them to the event, ensuring that they have a good time while they are there, and giving them front row access to anything happening at the event. You’ll also need to thank your sponsors publicly at the event.You may also want to host a sponsor follow-up meeting after the event to discuss how the event went, what could be done differently in the future, etc.

, Remember to thank all your volunteers for their help organizing the company gathering. Write personal cards recognizing their individual contributions. This is a good way to help make the whole planning process as pleasant as possible.


Showing your appreciation will most likely motivate your helpers into assisting you again in the future.

Create a written explanation of your policies.,
Make sure employees are aware of these policies.,
Follow disciplinary guidelines exactly.,
Keep your policies within reason.",How to Monitor Your Employees1," Your policies will only be effective if they are explained in clear terms in an employee handbook or guide. This guide should be easily accessible to all employees and define what your policies are and what will be done in the event that they are not followed. For any monitoring policy you have, like internet or phone monitoring, you may want to also explain the thought process that led to your policies. Explaining why you are doing so may help to reduce employee mistrust caused by monitoring their activities.Set clear policies on timekeeping, billable hours (if applicable), personal phone calls, and personal internet use at work. Encourage employees to take off-the-clock breaks where appropriate.;
, If any type of monitoring is taking place beyond standard checking-in on progress, such as if you are using phone or internet monitoring, you should inform your employees directly. Hold a meeting or send out a mass email to explain changes in monitoring policy and explain exactly when and how information will be recorded, saved, and deleted.


In some states, like Connecticut and Delaware, you are legally required to inform your employees of any internet monitoring.
Even if you are not required to inform your employees about monitoring, there may be backlash if you don't tell them and they find out on their own., When an employee fails to follow your policies, make sure that the stated disciplinary action for that infraction is taken. Make sure to apply policies equally to all employees. Be clear about your intentions. Document the disciplinary action and have the employee sign disciplinary plans. If you fail to properly follow these guidelines, employees will come to believe that your carefully-set policies will not really be enforced., Don't check in too often or institute overly-limiting internet policies. A nosy boss can decrease morale and make employees feel nervous. Focus on results, rather than on process. If an employee is producing good work and works well in a team, don't harp too much on the details.Give your upper-level staff more freedom. While it might be appropriate to give a temp or administrative assistant who has little investment in your business a computer that faces an open space you can monitor, upper-level staff will expect trust.
Freedom to do work their own way will likely make upper-level staff more productive, not less.

Get a travel industry job.,
Become an adventure guide.,
Get a job as a nurse.,
Become a travel professional.,
Try teaching English abroad.,
Get a service industry job.",How to Work and Travel1," What skills do you have that you could use while traveling? Some employers have seasonal work that you may be able to train for or do easily. Research online and you will find travel-based jobs for every kind of skill.;
, Adventure outfitters and summer camps recruit guides in the off season. If you want to be a rafting guide in the USA, start looking for summer work in the autumn or winter.Surf instructors in Costa Rica work during the winters.

Resorts need staff for every activity they offer, so find out things you can do at your skill level.

, Traveling nurses are in high demand. Many agencies will hire nurses from three months to a year to work at hospitals around the USA. Some even offer housing. Search online for traveling nursing positions and contact the recruiters. Most websites list location, pay rate, and benefits up front., Airline pilots, flight attendants, cruise ship staff, and transportation employees such as truck drivers travel as part of their work. While some of these jobs don't allow for much time to explore tourist areas, travel professionals can find ways to get out and enjoy, too. Research the industry to see what kind of skills and training are required., There are many opportunities to teach English abroad. Most places require that you take their Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) training class before you can sign on.This may expensive, but once you have the TOEFL certification, you can teach in many countries. Agencies often help with job placement., Many tourist destinations have resorts, theme parks, and restaurants looking for waiters, housekeepers, and attendants. The highest seasons for family tourist destinations are when children are not in school. For other places, high season may be during the best weather or centered around holidays. Check around for vacation high season in the area where you want to travel."

Choose a location.,
Research and obtain any necessary permits and regulations.To work abroad in most countries, you will need to obtain a work visa from that country, or a visa that allows certain types of work.Each nation has specific and individual laws regarding foreign workers, so make sure to research these when deciding where you want to work abroad.,
Decide if you want short-term or long-term work.Knowing whether or not you want to spend an extended period of time working abroad will help you when seeking a position overseas.,
Figure out if you want to find a job and then move, or move first and find a job once you are abroad.Either option may be viable, depending on your situation and location.,
Learn about the language and culture.Immersing yourself in the language and culture of a nation abroad is the best way to gain real international experience.,

Seek academic credit for work abroad.",How to Work Abroad," You might be certain that you want to work in a certain location, or just excited about the prospect of working abroad and ready to pursue any opportunity in any country. Either way, you’ll need to start with a specific location so that you can research the requirements to find work there.


You will want to look into the cost of living, the potential salary you can earn, housing possibilities, as well as living standards for any country that you are considering.The CIA World Factbook, the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office, and similar organizations maintain lots of information about nations of the world.Reviewing this information can help you decide where you want to work.
For any location you are considering, you should also think about its attitudes toward foreigners in general as well as things like safety, human rights, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, etc.;
,


Make sure to learn your home country’s tax laws, in addition to meeting the requirements for working in the country abroad. For instance, you may be required to pay taxes to your home country on money earned abroad, in addition to taxes paid in the country of work., Some programs are specifically designed for short-term workers, while long-term employment abroad can lead to a more immersive experience.


When deciding how long to work abroad, you should also consider how the idea fits into your other obligations and plans (school, family, career path, etc.).

, Having a job lined up beforehand can streamline the process of working abroad, as well as reduce anxiety. On the other hand, waiting to find a job until you are in your location can allow you to get abroad sooner. Moreover, you may find it easier to look for a job once you are able to meet other people and learn about the location first-hand.

, However, you can prepare to work abroad, and make yourself a more viable job candidate, by learning as much as you can beforehand.


See if a local university or other institution offers a course in the language of the nation you are hoping to work in.
Look for online study courses.
Follow a program of self-study to learn the language.
At the very least, study basic words and phrases (greetings, “please,” “thank you,” numbers, etc.) before you go.

, Consider gaining skills in such an area before seeking work overseas.

, Once you have narrowed down the location, you will need to start investigating how to find work in the country of your choice. Research databases like the U.S. State Department’s extensive list of resources for expatriates and those seeking work abroad.This information can give you a general overview of the kinds of programs, support, and placement services that can help you find work abroad.

, If it has offices or positions abroad, inquire about these., Governments are responsible for many jobs for foreigners. You may be able to seek work abroad directly by applying to an overseas job with your government. Alternatively, you may be able to work for your government in your home country, and then shift to an international position later.


Some specific programs, such as International Organization Careers, help connect applicants to jobs with government organizations abroad., You can start by looking into those organizations which have an international presence, and see if any of them have positions available overseas.

, This can be equally rewarding and lead to immersive and unique international experiences. Check with governmental and non-governmental organizations, religious centers, and other groups that often have volunteer opportunities abroad.


Some volunteer opportunities can provide a stipend or other support (housing, a food allowance, etc.) that can help fund your time abroad.
If you are volunteering abroad, you may also be able to raise money beforehand in your community or through a crowdfunding campaign to help support you while you are overseas.

, If you want to streamline the process of finding work abroad, you can use a service that specializes in connecting interested individuals with overseas employment opportunities.There may be a fee or other requirements for using these services, but they can take some of the hard work off your hands.

, In addition to working for a company, government, non-profit, or other established organization, you could also seek less-traditional or irregular employment abroad.As long as you follow the laws and regulations of your destination and home countries, you may also be able to work abroad by:


Serving as an au pair
Busking
Writing freelance journalism or other work
Giving informal lessons (language, music, etc.)
Serving as a private tour guide for tourists
Farming; the organization World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF), or instance, connects people with agricultural employment overseas., Students have lots of opportunities to work abroad, since many colleges and universities are very supportive of international experiences. If you are a student, one of the first things you should do is contact your school about your plans to see what resources are available to help you.


Many colleges and universities have an office of international education or study abroad; it may also be able to help you find work overseas.Programs such as STA Travel and the Council on International Education Exchange (CIEE) are intended to help students travel, study, and work abroad.One or more of these organizations may even have a representative or office on your campus.

, Some programs offer special work opportunities designed for current or recent students. These programs work to place applicants with jobs abroad, ranging from entry-level to highly specialized. In addition, these programs may offer support (language instruction, health care, housing, etc.) that can be a big help when working abroad. Examples of these programs include:


International Organization CareersThe Fulbright ProgramsThe Peace Corps, Contact your school’s international education or study abroad office about overseas internship opportunities to get ideas.

, If your work abroad is potentially related to your academic program, you may be able to see credit for working abroad, as is often the case with internships. Contact your academic program about this possibility well before going abroad so that you have time to plan and coordinate.

Decide how you want to do installation and support.,
Be prepared for an adoption period.,
Look to enhance your open source CMS.",How to Select an Open Source Content Management System2," Since open source CMS are available to all, they have community forums that help with support. However, if you aren't very proficient with computer programming, you will have to follow an alternate method.


Hire a web vendor to install the program and train your staff. Although you will need to pay for this service, it will decrease the problems you will have with the open source CMS. Ask if the vendor offers tech support help in the future at a fee.
Task your IT department with installing and training staff. You may have to send part of your staff to a course to learn all about the program and its requirements. If you already have a fully competent IT staff, you will save money with this option.
Install the program yourself and train your staff. If you and your employees are very computer literate, it may not be essential to get outside support. You can look for plugins in the directory and read how to fix problems in the forums.

, After changing any database, you should be prepared for a slow period where your employees learn to use the program, and at times, there are complaints. Try to wait for a period of 30 to 90 days before deciding if the CMS will work, because most website changes take time to adjust to.

, Look for extensions and plugins, once your employees are completely functional with the backend. The great thing about CMS is that talented volunteer programmers are improving it all the time.


Subscribe to blogs, newsletters or forums about your CMS blog. This will keep you aware of new updates or plugins. It will also direct you to websites that use the CMS so that you can see what others are doing with it.

Check in on your employees.,
Ask for an explanation of what an employee has been working on.,
Make employees document their own work.,
Assess works in progress.,
Ask others about employee interactions.",How to Monitor Your Employees2," From time to time, check in with staff in their own office at an unscheduled time. If a staff member is frequently ""clicking away"" from a window when you walk in, or hanging up the phone, you may need to express some concern. Watching employees in person can also help you offer constructive criticism for their work., One simple way to keep employees accountable is to have regular conversations with them about how their work is going. Ask them what they have done since your last conversation, asking more questions and evaluating their responses as the conversation develops. Ask for details and tangible evidence of results., Have your employee record their work progress in activity logs, checklists, or progress reports. However, reports should not be overly burdensome or ""busywork,"" but should encourage team members and management alike to keep in touch and on the same page. Don't be afraid to ask for proof of work described in a report when you speak with the employee., If you're concerned about productivity, ask for concrete proof of performance that is measurable and time-bound. If an employee is a project leader, set milestones but also ask for plans and timelines for the project. Check in with other staff to make sure all members of the project team are communicating. Personally track the progress of longer term projects and assess their accuracy and completeness.


For example, you could monitor data entries for an employee who is assigned to managing a database. You could evaluate the timeliness of the entries, their accuracy, and their adherence to company guidelines., Ask suppliers, customers, and other employees about their interactions with a given employee to get a picture of how that employee has been behaving. However, you need a way to increase the objectivity of these observation so that employees are not unfairly represented. When asking for this information, ask for details about the interaction instead of impressions. Ask for descriptions of the interactions instead of evaluations. And always keep an open mind; you never know when an employee is being misrepresented."
"
Choose monitoring software.,
Block harmful or inappropriate websites.,
Monitor email.,
Make sure you are in compliance with the law.",How to Monitor Your Employees3," Monitoring software can be set up in a number of ways. The first thing to consider is setting a complete system with a server. This will include antivirus and malware protection, and also employee monitoring. If you don't have IT staff to maintain the equipment, you can use a cloud-based service like Trend Micro Business Security or Symantec Cloud to get these services. These services are not tremendously expensive; expect to pay about $150 per year.


If you are just trying to track employee web usage and block some sites, a simpler software package will do. This service will be cheaper and allow you to monitor and filter web pages, view keystrokes, and capture screenshots. For example, Interguard Sonar provides these services.
In some cases, you may even be able to get rudimentary tracking systems for free. For example, ActivTrak monitors system web traffic and produces a monthly report for you., Employers have the right to monitor what web pages their employees visit and to block websites that they deem unimportant to business operations, inappropriate, or potentially harmful. Mainly, employers block certain websites to either make sure employees are productive, like blocking Facebook or stock trading sites that distract them, or to ensure that employees are not harassing coworkers or committing corporate espionage.


Employers may also block sites considered to be pornographic or hateful.
Some monitoring packages allow for set time limits on certain types of websites, for example allowing a set amount of time each day on social media sites.When you notice that your employees are visiting a website unrelated to work frequently, block that website and then send out an email reminding them that they are on company time., Monitoring emails is more difficult for employers to justify. Before reading any employee emails, employees should be notified of the policy that allows their emails to be read. In addition, the employer usually needs a reason for the suspicion that led them to read the emails, like a documented incident with that employee. It is also difficult for employers to justify reading emails if they claimed originally that emails will be confidential., Certain monitoring measures may interfere with your employees' right to privacy. Check with an employment lawyer before you install monitoring software. Make sure there is written documentation on the software that the employees have signed, and that everyone understands what the software is for."
"
Record phone conversations.,
Set up video surveillance.,
Track your employees' locations.",How to Monitor Your Employees4," Federal law allows employers to monitor employee phone conversations. However, this is only true for business-related calls, like those with customers or suppliers. An employer is generally not permitted to monitor personal calls, and must stop recording and monitoring the call when they realize it is personal. The only exception to this is if personal phone calls are explicitly prohibited by workplace policy.


The recording and monitoring of voice mails should be done only with justification, like a documented suspicion of misconduct.Phone conversations may be recorded using phone taps or an electronic recording system. In some cases, this can be tied in with your other monitoring software.

, Businesses typically use video surveillance to discourage customers from stealing products. However, some businesses also use video surveillance to make sure that employees are being productive and not violating the business's policies. Monitoring employees this way can provide you with unbiased evidence of employee misconduct and can also motivate them to work more diligently. However, the constant feeling of being watched might make employees uncomfortable and lead to a decline in morale. For these reasons, carefully consider the pros and cons before using video surveillance.


In many states, video surveillance is also carefully regulated by state law. Check with your state laws before implementing this type of monitoring.
Videotaping employees doing certain activities, like using the restroom or changing, is always illegal and can result in criminal penalties., Certain apps, like Xora and TSheets, allow employers to track employee movement through their smartphones. This is typically used for clocking in or out and is legal if the employee gives consent. However, some employees are tracked 24/7 using the software, which could give them legal grounds to sue their employers for breach of privacy. If you implement this type of policy, consult with a lawyer to make sure you are doing so legally.


Shipping or driving-based businesses may also use trackers in vehicles to ensure that drivers stay on route. This is a common practice and is generally acceptable."

Get a freelance job.,
Start working from home.,
Figure out how to earn passive income.,
Start your own business.",How to Work and Travel2," Many writers, photographers, web designers, and graphic designers can do their work from anywhere in the world as long as they have an Internet connection. There are online companies recruiting people with these types of skills. Be wary of anyone asking for money. There are plenty of legitimate companies hiring freelancers. Be prepared to bid for freelance work or possibly get paid a bit less than if you worked in the same job at an office., Ask your current employer if you might be able to start working from home (if that’s possible for your type of work). If they say yes, then you may be able to start traveling and completing your work while you’re on the road. Most work-from-home jobs allow employees to complete the bulk of their work online or to submit their work from another location. You don’t have to stay home to work from home., If you have web design and writing skills, you may start blogs or content-based websites that generate passive income through advertising and referral programs. This takes a bit of a time investment upfront, but once the site is established and active, it may generate returns. Start these sites while traveling or better yet, get them up and running before you go. Sites that are generating money will need maintenance and content updates once you are on the road.Advertisers usually make direct deposits into your bank account. Depending on your home country, there may be restrictions or limitations to getting paid, so be sure you have access to the money you earn before you begin your travels.

, Become a travel consultant, importer, or zip-line installer. Find a need for your specific services and skills, then market them in a way that makes sense for you and gives you the freedom you desire from your work.For example, engineers might start a business building zip-lines or obstacle courses for resorts around the world. Travel buffs can offer their services to corporations sending employees on international travel. If you love to shop, set up an importing business and next time you travel get inventory for resale.

Get rid of the material excess in your life.,
Downsize your home.,
Eliminate your debt.,
Change your expectations.",How to Work and Travel3," This includes things that take up space and cost money. People who successfully work and travel are usually comfortable with living light rather than being loaded down with possessions. If you have an expensive car that requires expensive insurance, you will be required to always make money to pay for that car. Having less possessions means you have more freedom to make enough to live and travel as you like., Living in a large home was a huge part of the American Dream for so long, but now more and more people are realizing the benefits of inhabiting smaller spaces. The smaller the space is, the less room you have for excessive material possessions too, so it will aid you in the whole process of downsizing your life.Living in a smaller home means less maintenance for you, less stress about the upkeep of your home, and probably less money each month in rent or mortgage.

, Having the freedom to travel because of learning to live with less often means getting rid of your financial ties to your current home location. It is much easier to travel freely when you don’t have a mortgage, credit card debt, or a car payment weighing you down and always pulling you back home.Try to limit your spending on frivolous luxuries so that you can put some extra money toward your debt each month. This will help you pay it off sooner so you can have more freedom to travel.
If you plan on traveling for extended periods of time, it might even make sense to sell some of your possessions in order to pay your debts down. For example, if you wanted to move abroad for a while, you might sell your car (since you won’t be using it anyways) to help you get your debt to a manageable level.

, We live in a consumer culture that is obsessed with always looking for the next big thing – the newest car, the biggest house, the nicest clothes, etc. If you maintain these kinds of expectations and desires for your life, it will be hard for you to be satisfied by living with less.Work on realizing that happiness isn’t achieved through material possessions and that living with less might help you create a more sustainable, more enjoyable life.
But to make this work, you’ll need to let go of those old expectations.

Choose a hobby you’re passionate about.,
Obtain some expertise.,
Consider your priorities.,
Create a budget.",How to Turn Your Hobby Into Your Career1," If you have more than one hobby, you will have a choice of which one you turn into a career. Think about which hobby really animates and excites you. Pursue a path to professionalism in that hobby.For instance, suppose you have several hobbies such as stamp collecting, carving wooden figurines, and building model rockets. Identify your favorite hobby by making a set of sentences in the form of “I like , but I like more.” Go through your entire set of hobbies using this “hobby playoff” system, pitting each against the others until you’ve identified the hobby which most excites you.
Popular hobbies that could become careers include musician, writer, actor, and artist.
Technical hobbies that could become careers include ham radio operator, TV repair technician, and computer repair specialist.;
, Even if you’re passionate about your hobby, sometimes you need special training to ensure you can meet your full potential when you make that hobby your career. This special training depends on what sort of hobby you’re interested in.If you’re interested in music, for instance, it might simply be an internship or apprenticeship at a record label.
If your hobby is making art, you might want to take some art classes at a local art institute or university to refine your craft.
If your hobby is rebuilding motorcycles, you might need to take a few classes at a technical or trade school to learn more about mechanics.
On the other hand, maybe all you need to do is spend more time with friends and colleagues who are also interested in the trade in order to get some pointers and feedback on how to perfect certain techniques or trade secrets within your hobby.

, Turning your hobby into a career can be a rewarding experience. But the transition also means that you’ll be losing opportunities for advancement in your current career (if you have one). It also means that you won’t be able to turn to that hobby in order to relax or unwind, because it will be your job. Finally, a new hobby-based career might mean a decline in your income, and might not be appropriate if you have significant financial obligations.Keep your expectations low. Even if you head into your new career with lots of optimism and passion, it might not be as great as it first seems. You might struggle for years to get your new operation off the ground. Prepare for long hours and six or seven-day workweeks.If your career switch doesn’t work out, don’t be afraid to give up and go back to what you did before (or something else entirely). There is no shame in admitting your career switch didn’t work out.

, Cut your spending before you make the leap. By saving money you’ll be better equipped to make up for potential shortfalls you might face as you transition your hobby into a career. Cutting down on spending will also give you a sense of what kind of lifestyle adjustments you might need to get used to when switching from one career to another.If you don’t feel like you will be able to live comfortably at your new income level, think about ways to either streamline your work process, or find another hobby you could turn into a career.

Explore the many reasons experts say we want to work.,
Consider why you are pursuing a certain career.,
Match these reasons to the motivations.,
Realize that your motivations change during your lifetime.,
As you conduct your own career planning, explore why work is important to you and clarify the values that you seek from an occupational choice.

",How to Understand the Motivation for Work," One approach to understanding the motivation to work is to examine it in terms of psychological theory. Abraham Maslow was a psychologist who did some pioneering work that sheds some light on this subject. Maslow's work is significant because he chose to study healthy people. He made this choice at a time when most psychological research was focused on neurosis and psychosis–a legacy derived from Sigmund Freud and a medical model of mental health. As a result of his research, Maslow developed a theory of motivation based on a hierarchy of five primary human needs, each level of which must be satisfied before the next level is fully operational:


Physiological needs. These are the most basic. The need for adequate food, clothing, and shelter are survival requirements that, until they are satisfied, take precedence over other needs. If you are worrying about where you next meal is coming from, you probably aren't spending much time contemplating the more abstract aspects of life.
Safety needs. These become important once survival needs are met. If personal safety is seriously at risk, this becomes a dominant focus of one's energy and effort. Safety needs are often emergent when you face the challenges of an unfamiliar environment, as when you first start college or when you begin a new job. As you become more familiar with the environment and feel safer, these needs recede in importance.
Belonging needs. These are motivational factors once physiological and safety needs are satisfied. This level represents the more social elements of human life. Belonging can be realized in many different ways. Some people meet this need by joining clubs, teams, churches, fraternities and sororities. Others get a sense of community from the interaction with fellow students in their classes, association with roommates, or continued contact with family.
Self-esteem needs become dominant once a sense of belonging is established. A feeling of self-worth, and confidence in one's abilities and capacities, are important at this level of motivation.
Self-actualization needs are at the pinnacle of Maslow's hierarchy. The realization and fulfillment of one's potential, of one's calling, can only be accomplished at this level of functioning.





;
, Your decision to pursue a given career direction is likely to be a combination of many of these factors. As you can see, working is more than just ""bringing home the bacon."" According to Maslow's theory, the kind of work you decide to do is a reflection of the level of satisfaction of your needs. Research done in 1983 by The Public Agenda Foundation resulted in a list of the top ten characteristics people seek in their work:


Respect from their co-workers
Work that is of some personal interest
Recognition for work well done
Opportunity to develop new skills
Power to improve work methods and procedures
Latitude to apply one's own thinking
Ability to see tangible end results
Efficient management
Work that is challenging
Information about what is going on at work.

, As you can see, many of these reasons indicate motivation related to belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization. Interestingly enough, high pay and job security didn't make the top ten, indicating a relative level of satisfaction with basic physiological and safety needs.

, Because the level of need satisfaction is a dynamic and developmental process, your motivation to work is likely to change as you gain life experience. What is most important at one stage of motivation recedes in importance once satisfaction of the primary need at that level is achieved. When this occurs, a different source of motivation becomes dominant. In practical terms, this means that the lower your dominant motivation for occupational choice falls within Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the more likely your motivation will change as you grow and develop as a person.

Learn about the industry, company and general business operations.,
Ask your supervisor and co-workers questions to gain firsthand knowledge.,
Understand the operations of other departments that you work closely with to build dynamic relationships.,
Understand and try to fit in with the company culture.,
Develop trusting relationships to build bonds.,
Be dedicated to becoming an integral team member.",How to Turn a Temp Job Into a Permanent Position1," Gaining relevant knowledge about all aspects of the company will increase your value to the firm. This is important in any type of position, because people who are valued will have a greater chance of keeping their jobs.


When employers hire someone to fill a temporary position (or any position, for that matter) there is a learning curve in fully understanding the industry, company and general business operations.






If the company is actually looking for a permanent employee, they will have to go through that learning curve with someone else if they do not choose to keep you. Although the company is willing to take this risk when establishing a temporary position, they would rather offer the job to someone they already have working instead of going back and training someone again.






When you are in a temporary position you would like to make permanent, you can gain the most knowledge by doing the following:






Research the industry. Conduct Internet searches by using the industry as the keyword. Learn about the competition, how the business is run, and what causes industry highs and lows.
Explore the company’s website. Learn about their vision, mission, philosophy, history, target market, product or service offerings, pricing and any other information that is available.

;
, Any clarification that you may need to do your job successfully and understand operations should be addressed to those who can help you. Your supervisor will see you are taking an interest in learning about the company and your role, while co-workers will be glad to help so that they will not need to pick up your slack.

, If your work affects another department, it is important to understand how this relationship works. Teamwork helps in reaching company goals, and you'll impress your superiors if you help further the effort.


Gaining this knowledge will help you seem like less of a temp and more of a regular employee.

, This will showcase your adaptability and further your efforts to be considered for a permanent position.


This gives you a greater chance of being accepted by team members and other co-workers instead of being seen as an outsider or just a temp.
If the company has a team-like culture where everyone in the department works together toward a common goal, it is best to be able to collaborate with other team members as opposed to being the loner who likes to work independently.

, While working with individuals throughout the company, it is important to form lasting relationships based on trust. This is especially important when a temp is trying for a permanent position. By moving away from the image of an outsider, and towards that of a trusted team member, you will be of more value to the company. Building trust will allow you to:


Be successful at your current tasks. There will be people willing to help you by providing information, advice, and assistance.
Leverage relationships for the future. For example, if you need someone in the legal department to look over a contract right away, you can take advantage of a relationship you've nourished to get this done more quickly than someone else might.
Get others on your side. Most likely, before deciding whether or not to offer you a permanent position, managers may ask your fellow workers their opinion of you. The more people you have on your side, the more they can vouch for your personality and work ethic.

, Becoming a valuable part of the team means being someone who is deeply appreciated and truly important to the success of the company. If you are seen as someone the company needs, you have a much greater chance of landing a permanent spot.


This can be done by following the above suggestions and by contributing consistently hard work.

"
Use different time zones to your advantage.,
Be careful to avoid mistakes when working across different time zones.,
Take advantage of today’s technology.,
Be aware of possible language differences.,
Realize that there may be cultural differences.,
For example, you are a US native working with someone in Germany.,
Note any special holidays for each country.",How to Work Around the World1," Time zones can be your biggest ally for success when working around the world. No longer do you need to be bound to the typical 9 AM to 5 PM work day within your time zone. You can work and complete a project for someone before they even start their day or hold multiple meetings throughout the day and still have time to complete your other daily tasks.


Try to choose your desired working times whether they are traditional or not and allow the time zones to define how you will complete these tasks. You can also use drastic time differences to have a good work and home life balance, or schedule even more clients throughout the day.
For example, if you are based in California on United States Pacific Standard Time (PST), but your client is in London, you have an eight hour time difference that you can use to your advantage.;
, When working in different time zones it is important to remember the following:


Remember which time zone the country is in. It can get very confusing because you naturally think in your time zone. When you work in multiple countries and time zones, it can get very confusing as to how many hours off they are from you. Being wrong by just one hour can cause inconveniences. A good trick here is to jot down the time difference on a sheet of paper for each client and have it handy.






Take into account daylight savings time. Some time zones do not have daylight savings time, further confusing time differences. In order to keep things straight, you can either research this over the internet or simply ask your client.
Define the time zone when setting meetings and deadlines. It is best to set meeting in the other party’s time zone. For instance, you are on United States Eastern Standard Time (EST) and your client is on US PST. You can specify the meeting for 9 AM PST in an email and then set your calendar to 12 PM EST.

, There are so many options available for individuals to hold meetings and share information with others while set in different locations. When working with others around the world, it is best to take advantage of these technologies as opposed to frequent travels and/or phone calls, emails and snail mail. Examples of great technologies available are:


Screen sharing software. Trainings and other meetings can be done most efficiently through screen sharing since everyone logged onto the software can be granted access to view a common screen.
Video conferencing. Video conferencing is the next best thing to holding a face-to-face meeting and can increase efficiencies when working in multiple locations.






Cloud based drives. Documents can be stored in a location where multiple people in multiple areas can access and edit the information. Cloud based drives are also the easiest way to store complex documents or to avoid frequent edits and confusion when being passed around through email.







, Different countries spell words differently, such as “organized” in the US and “organised” in Canada. There are also different meanings to common words such as “the first floor” means ground level in the US but the first floor above ground level in the UK. It is important to recognize these differences before any mistakes are made.


Researching the differences between the country you are from and the country you are working with is best to do before getting to work.

, Cultures vary throughout the world both outside and inside of business operations. Therefore it is important to recognize that different cultures handle business relationships and meetings differently. Before working with another culture, it is important to research and understand these cultural differences in order to minimize mistakes, frustration and potentially offending to the other party.

, You tend to get frustrated when your contact takes a bit longer than your liking to come to a decision. Without understanding the culture, you may think this person just takes too long to make up their mind.


However after understanding the German business culture a little more, you may realize that Germans do not like to rush into any business decision and expect to gain as much information as possible beforehand.

, Different countries celebrate different holidays and therefore may be out of the office on days when you are not. You can use this to your advantage by either taking some time off in your day or scheduling other clients from different areas to fill in the gap and possibly make more money or get ahead on some projects.


Consequently if you are typically off for a holiday that some of your clients do not celebrate, it is important to notify them so they are not expecting you to be available on that day.

Read your policy.,
Interpret “business casual.” Some dress codes use the vague phrase “business casual” but don’t supply examples.,
Understand how casual “casual Friday” can be.,
Ask a supervisor to define vague words.,
Listen to your boss’ comments.,
Show your boss sample outfits.,
Remember grooming requirements.,
Wear a uniform, if given one.,
Ask if you can go home and change.,
Identify the basic elements of discrimination law.,
Analyze whether the dress code constitutes religious discrimination.,
Check if the dress code is racially discriminatory.,
Consider if the dress code constitutes gender discrimination.,
Analyze whether dressing “sexy” is harassment.,
Consider whether the dress code discriminates against the disabled.,
Request a reasonable accommodation.,
Consult with an employment lawyer.",How to Understand and Comply with Dress Codes in the Workplace," If your employer adopts a dress code policy, they should distribute it to you. Look in your employee manual or handbook, where it should be published.Don’t accept a verbal dress code. Instead, ask for something in writing.


Dress code policies cannot single you out. They must apply to all employees.If your boss doesn’t have the policy in writing, they may be making something up.;
, You can generally interpret business casual to mean the following:Men can wear dress pants or khakis paired with a sweater, button-up dress shirt, or shirt with a collar (such as a polo). Men can also wear a sport coat and casual dress shoes.
Women have more options—and more ways they can appear too casual. Generally, women should wear dress pants or a skirt coupled with a sweater, blouse, or blazer. Women should wear pumps, flats, or open-toed shoes.
Remember that business casual clothing must always be clean and pressed. Don’t show up in a wrinkled pair of khakis and a polo shirt with a mustard stain on the front.

, Some workplaces give employees a casual day (usually Friday) once a week or once a month. It’s entirely possible to be too casual, however, even on casual Friday. Instead, aim for a presentable appearance.


For example, don’t wear pajama bottoms or yoga pants to work. Instead, choose jeans as a casual option.
Also avoid anything with writing or obscene images on it. For example, if you choose a T-shirt, choose one that has no printing on it.Your messages or imagery could offend other employees and contribute to a hostile work environment.
Make sure clothing is clean and mended, without rips or tears.
If you’re a new employee, err on the side of being too dressy on a casual Friday.

, A poorly drafted dress code will contain a lot of mushy words which you might not understand. For example, ask a supervisor to define the following:“appropriate”
“proper”
“reserved”

, You can pick up important clues about whether you are under- or over-dressing by listening to your boss and coworkers.For example, if your boss asks why you are so dressed up, you might consider losing the tie or sports coat.


By contrast, if someone remarks on how casual or “sporty” you look, then take that as a sign you are under-dressed.

, If you don’t understand what is expected of you, ask your boss to look at some sample outfits. You can show them pictures of clothes online and ask, “Is that appropriate?”


Ask a colleague if you are too embarrassed to ask your boss. Choose someone who always appears well-dressed. They can help you understand a vague dress code.

, A dress code typically involves more than limitations on what you can wear for clothes. It also may set different grooming standards related to the following:hair length
hair style
facial hair
makeup
tattoos
piercings

, Some employers give employees uniforms as a way to standardize your appearance to the public. If you’re given a uniform, wear it. Don’t “forget” to wear the uniform and show up to work in other clothes.


Look at it this way: wearing a uniform greatly simplifies getting dressed in the morning. You don’t have to worry about what to wear.
Remember to keep uniforms neat and tidy. You may need to launder it more than once a week. If the uniform becomes frayed, ask your employer for a replacement.
Be aware that your employer can deduct the cost of the uniform from your wages, so long as it doesn’t cause you to fall below the minimum wage., You might arrive at work only to be told you have violated the dress code. Ask your employer if you can go home and change into something more appropriate. This is a good option if you can get home and back to work in a short period of time.


Your employer can legally send you home without pay for violating the dress code. For that reason, it’s a good idea to take the dress code seriously.

, Almost no employer outright discriminates against employees based on gender, race, religion, etc. However, businesses sometimes adopt “neutral” policies that impact certain groups more harshly than other groups. Sometimes, these policies can constitute discrimination.


A dress code is an example of a neutral policy that might affect groups differently. For example, a requirement that you wear a hat when working might discriminate against people whose religion prohibits head coverings.
A court will look at whether the policy has a legitimate business purpose and is necessary for the job. For example, a policy requiring head coverings for food workers is both legitimate and necessary.
However, an employer also must try to accommodate any objection to the dress code based on religion or disability, so long as the accommodation doesn’t create an undue hardship for the business., Both federal and state laws make it illegal for an employer to discriminate on the basis of religion.Pay attention to whether the policy possibly discriminates against you for religious reasons.


For example, employers generally need to accommodate yarmulkes, hijabs, and turbans.Anti-discrimination laws apply whether you are a member of a recognized organized religion (such as Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, etc.) or a small, unorganized sect., A dress code cannot discriminate or create a disparate impact on different racial groups. If you think the dress code does, then you may want to challenge it.


For example, several African American men have challenged grooming requirements that they be clean shaven. Because some African Americans have a specific skin condition that makes shaving painful, their challenges have been successful., Employers can require different uniforms and grooming standards for men and women.For example, a dress code could prohibit men from wearing makeup but allow women to wear makeup. However, employers cannot place a heavier burden on one gender than on the other.Employers also must enforce a dress code uniformly. For example, a dress code might insist that employees wear pants in the summer. If your boss allows women to wear skirts, then they are not enforcing the dress code uniformly without regard to gender. In this example, male employees could argue that enforcement of the dress code is discriminatory.

, Some jobs sell sex. For example, if you work at a casino or nightclub, management might require that female employee dress in a provocative manner. In some situations, an employer can require you to dress this way.In particular, employers can require you to dress provocatively if that is their image.
However, the provocative dress can’t encourage customers or others to sexually harass you with gropes, cat calls, or other harassing behavior.

, Some dress codes might impact people with disabilities. If so, you can request that your boss make an exception to the dress code. Consider the following examples:Your boss requires certain footwear, but you must wear specific shoes because of your diabetes. Your boss can let you wear more comfortable shoes.
You develop lesions because of medical treatment, which makes your uniform uncomfortable. Your boss can help you pick out alternate work clothes to wear that still are appropriate for the workplace.
Your broken leg is in a cast, and you can’t wear pants, which are required by your boss. Your employer might let you wear shorts to work until the cast is removed.

, If the dress code discriminates against you on the basis of religion or disability, you can request an accommodation. Put it in writing and mention exactly why you need the accommodation.Don’t assume your employer knows anything about your disability or religion. They may ask for documentation, such as medical records or a letter from a faith leader.
Your employer should be willing to work with you to come up with a reasonable solution.

, The law on dress codes is constantly changing as society changes. For example, gender non-conforming employees complicate the idea that employers can require different standards for men and women. If you think your employer’s dress code is discriminatory, you should seek out an employment lawyer.


Obtain a referral from your local or state bar association. Call and schedule a consultation. Ask the attorney if you need to bring anything with you to the consultation. Also check how much the consultation will cost.

Create products that promote or enable your hobby.,
Help others in your hobby learn the business.,
Write or speak about your hobby.,
Learn how to repair objects associated with your hobby.",How to Turn Your Hobby Into Your Career2," For instance, if you love reading, you could create a line of T-shirts that read “I love reading” or “Books are cool.” If you love music, create a special rack to help organize your LPs better. Since you’re already an enthusiast, you should already have some idea as to what sorts of products other hobbyists would be interested in (and which they wouldn’t be interested in).Talk to friends who share your hobby and bounce ideas off of them to see if they and/or others they know would be interested in your product idea.
For instance, if reading is a hobby of yours, you might ask a fellow hobbyist, “Would you be interested in a shirt that reads ‘Books are cool’? Do you think anyone else who shares our hobby would be interested in such a product?”

, If your previous or current career involved doing business – accounting, marketing, or some related field – you could use that experience to help others who are also pursuing a career in your hobby to run their own business more effectively. Or, instead of teaching them how to do it themselves, you could offer your services to someone working within your hobby field who is looking for an accountant, communications specialist, or a related professional position. In this way, you could make a living by consulting in your hobby-field.For instance, if you are a professional event planner, you could approach an up-and-coming artist and offer to help them host a gallery of their work.
If you own a delivery service and your hobby is baking, you could offer to deliver cupcakes or other baked goods for a local bakery.
If you are a graphic designer but you love playing music, you could shop your artistic talents to bands you love and offer to draft album art or fliers for their shows.

, If you have a lot of experience and information about your hobby, you may have arrived at some deep truths that others might benefit from understanding. For example, if your hobby is repair old cars, you might be able to write or speak in a compelling way about the virtues of patience, or how repairing cars taught you to consider multiple possibilities when trying to solve a problem. Others, even those who have no interest in car repair in itself, might be interested in hearing how you came to these realizations and think about how they could incorporate your insights into their own lives.One low-cost way to reach a large audience for your speaking is to create videos and post them online to a platform like Vimeo or YouTube.
In addition, you might be able to write for other hobbyists who want to deepen and extend their knowledge of the hobby. Contact trade magazines and organizations associated with your hobby and inquire if they could use someone like you to write articles or present at upcoming conferences.
Write to the editor of publications related to your hobby and introduce yourself. Include information about your qualifications. Ask, “Would it be possible for me to write for your publication?”
If you’re interested in presenting a talk at a hobbyists’ conference, contact the organizers of the conference and provide information about your qualifications to speak. Ask the organizers, “How can I schedule a talk at the upcoming conference?”

, Many hobbies have some sort of machinery or some device associated with the hobby. For example, ham radio operators have extensive radio sets. Bikes have customizable seats, front and rear lights, and handlebars. If you know how to repair or refurbish the components of the gadgetry associated with your hobby, you could market your services in order to build a viable career.Other hobby-related devices that might need repair include computer parts, video game consoles, guitars, guitar amplifiers, and fishing rods.

Identify avenues for sales.,
Set clear prices.,
Request time off work to test the feasibility of your new career.,
Devise a business plan.,
Slowly increase commitments in your new career.,
Get the word out.",How to Turn Your Hobby Into Your Career3," There are a variety of ways to make money doing what you love. You could offer arts and crafts you’ve made online at sites like Etsy. You should also consider having a physical presence. If you’re not ready or unwilling to open an actual store, you should at least look for festivals, conventions, or expos where you could sell your services.For instance, if your hobby is photography, you might be able to set up at photography conventions and offer on-the-spot framing services.
If you want to make your rock band a career, you might be able to enter a battle of the bands contest in your area. Alternately, you might be able to set up a generator at large music festivals and play for anyone interested in hearing you.

, Be willing to negotiate, but be honest about how much you will or will not accept for your product or service. Talk to others in your field to get some idea as to how much you think you should charge for the services in your new career.Ask others who have turned your hobby into a career how much they charged when they first began, and how much you should charge when you’re beginning.
For instance, if you want to change your love of nature from a hobby into a career by offering guided nature walks, you could contact others who offer a similar service. Ask the former hobbyist, “How much did you charge for your services when you first made the jump from doing nature walks as a hobby to guiding others on nature walks as a career? How much do you think I should charge for my own service?”

, There are always a few hiccups whenever you start a new career, but you should have some idea after a week or so as to whether or not you’d be able to maintain the level of work necessary to make it in the modern economy. Use this time to see if you are able to stick to your schedule, remain self-directed and focused, and work with enough efficiency to make your new career worth it.Making a career of your hobby means producing goods or services at a higher rate than you did when it was just something you did for fun. For instance, just because you enjoy making jewelry for friends doesn’t mean you’ll be able to produce jewelry in a timely manner for multiple clients all over the country.
Use the time you take off work to determine if you’ll be able to sustain yourself in new career.

, A business plan is a roadmap for your success. Your business plan should include lots of research pertaining to how the current market for your future career looks. Your business plan should include a mission statement describing what your business does on a day-to-day basis, as well as a larger, more overarching vision statement that outlines your long-term goals and objectives. A comprehensive business plan will answer the following questions, among others:Is there stiff competition in the field you intend to enter?
Does your business offer consumers something different or new that can’t be obtained from other similar businesses in the field?
How will you fund your business?
What are the milestones for your business? How much do you expect to earn in your first quarter? First year? Second, third, or fourth years?

, After you’ve taken a week or so to get your feet wet in your potential new career, try to do it part-time for a longer period while still working your regular gig. This will give you time to perfect your wares (or services) and build a client base. You’ll also be able to iron out any kinks that might emerge in the course of developing your new career talents.After you’ve settled into a pattern, continue to increase commitment to your new career while decreasing your work-hours at your present career.

, Tell family and friends to support your business, and promote your work among others who might be interested. Promote yourself on social media and contract with a web developer to help you build a great website. If you have the budget for it, think about taking some ads out in the local paper or printing some fliers and hanging them around town in high-visibility locations.Depending on the career path you’ve chosen, you might want to invest more money into advertising as you grow your career.
If you want to share information about your new carpentry business with family and friends, say, “I am trying to get my new business off the ground. Do you know anyone interested in my wooden products or my woodcarving services?”

Stick to it.,
Continue to innovate.,
Encourage feedback.",How to Turn Your Hobby Into Your Career4," When you first begin turning your hobby into a career, you might feel that doing so is an unattainable dream. But a little perseverance goes a long way. Set a schedule that devotes at least some time each day to your hobby.Start by spending at least 15 minutes per day on your hobby/career.
Slowly increase the amount of time you spend on your hobby until you’re devoting enough time to it (and making enough money at it) that you can settle into a regular work rhythm.

, Even if you manage to turn your hobby into a career, it’s a constant struggle to keep your product or service competitive. Think about new products you can offer, new services you can provide, and new ways to improve or enhance your existing products.For instance, instead of just offering whole pizzas at your pizzeria, offer pizza by the slice, pizza with a drink and fries as a combo, or rolled-up slices of pizza. Check other local pizzerias to see what sorts of pizza products they offer – then create something even better.
If the hobby you turned into a career is crafting small dolls, expand the line of dolls you have available. Try making dolls shaped like ducks, cats, pigs, and dogs. Create historical dolls from the Renaissance, or dolls dressed in the traditional garb of various nations around the world like Japan or France.
Consult with your business partners frequently in order to figure out ways to keep your career afloat. Customer feedback is also invaluable for identifying new product-creation opportunities. Ask both customers and business partners, “Do you have any ideas for new products that we should think about introducing?”

, As you transition your hobby into a career, solicit feedback from friends, family, and – most important of all – customers. Listen to what they think about your products and services. Find out what products or services they wish you had. Respond to their advice and suggestions by tweaking existing products and adding new ones to meet consumer demands.Ask your business partners what their views are, too. Regularly ask them, “How do you think our business is doing? Do you see any areas where we could improve? Please, speak frankly.” Listen carefully to their answers and come to a decision that you all agree with.
While it’s important to respond to consumer demands and market changes, it’s also important that you stay true to yourself and your brand. Don’t try to fit your service or product into every small change in trends and styles.

Think and act like a permanent employee to be seen as one.,
Beat the temp stigma by exceeding expectations for a temp worker.,
Express interest in a permanent position.,
Wait for a decision to be made.",How to Turn a Temp Job Into a Permanent Position2," Having the “just a temp” mindset will prevent you from achieving success. If you treat the job as a temporary position by not giving your all and showing little commitment, you will be treated as a temp and not offered the opportunity to stay. Acting like a permanent employee means coming to work as if you already are one. The more normal and “at home” you feel, the more you will be seen as such by others. You can get started by doing the following:


Show up on time
Follow the rules
Dress according to the dress code
Make connections
Share ideas
Complete assigned tasks to the best of your ability

, You may not be expected to go above and beyond or even to do a good job. If you value a career opportunity, treat the position as if it is already permanent. Exceed expectations by doing the following:


Show attention to detail, and keep mistakes to a minimum. Your supervisor will be relieved to know s/he won't have to go over your work or ask you to re-do it.
Work overtime to complete projects that have strict deadlines. If your supervisor allows it, you will show dedication to the company by offering to work overtime.
Participate in team meetings. Actively participate in team conversations by giving your opinions and sharing your ideas. This will show you truly want to contribute to team success.
Volunteer and take initiative on special projects. Sometimes situations arise where certain team members are required to head up special projects. Do not let your temporary status get in your way. If you feel you can truly contribute to the project, volunteer! Your supervisor will appreciate your initiative.

, It is important to notify your supervisor that you are interested in permanent placement with the company. However, it is not good to keep talking about it, because you will seem annoying and pushy. When bringing this up to your supervisor you can choose to do the following:


Express interest at the beginning of your employment. You can simply say, “I am excited to start working with you and hope my accomplishments will prove my ability to do this job on a permanent basis.”
Remind your supervisor toward the middle of your specified time with the company, preferably after making a good contribution or completing a major project successfully. You can remind them by saying, “I really feel like I can succeed here. If I am offered this position permanently, I know I can contribute to more team successes.""
Have a discussion with your supervisor a few weeks before your temp status ends. Use this time to be honest about your interest in a permanent position, and remind them of your successes. You can also ask about time-frames and notices, since you would need to seek other employment if they choose not to offer you the job permanently.

, There is no need to keep asking about a permanent job. Your desire has been made clear, and it is up to the company now. Most likely the decision will be made collectively with input from your co-workers, supervisor, HR and possibly upper-level management.


Be patient. If you seem to fit in well and are the right person for the job, you will be offered the position.

Travel to other locations when necessary.,
Research each culture further to understand their customs and culture.,
Make the effort to experience different cultures in order to understand your contacts.,
Take back lessons learned and apply them to future business relationships.",How to Work Around the World2," Even after using technology and keeping frequent contact, it is sometimes needed to physically visit your clients or partners. Traveling to their location will not only aid in completing certain work tasks but will also allow for working relationships to grow stronger. A stronger working relationship can not only be beneficial in working together to complete current projects but can also be beneficial for an ongoing relationship with possible mutual benefits in the future.

, As mentioned previously, it is important to research different cultures before conducting business in other parts of the world. When researching differences between your culture and your business contacts it is important to recognize any differences in the following:


Gift Giving: Some cultures accept gifts as a good gesture, while others see it as a bribe.






Handshakes: Learn if it is appropriate to shake hands, whether there is an issue with opposite sex handshakes, who initiates the handshake, the length and the level of firmness.






Bowing: As opposed to handshakes, some cultures prefer to bow.






Kissing: In addition to shaking hands, some cultures kiss on the cheek.






Communication style: This includes preferences for both verbal and nonverbal communication.






Eye contact: Some cultures prefer eye contact while others find it intimidating.






Pre business practices: Some cultures will get right to businesses while others will make small talk first. #*Decision making: Some cultures like to take more time than others to make a decision and rarely will change their minds once a decision is made.






Contracts: Many cultures prefer a formal business contract, but others find a handshake and one’s word good enough.







, When visiting your business contacts around the world you should try to gain an understanding of where they come from and why they do the things they do. Understanding one’s background and culture makes working with a person much easier because you can anticipate and appreciate how one will react in a certain situation.


For example, if you are an American and are asked to travel to China where your business contact is located, you may wonder why you must travel all that way. Based on your research you know the Chinese value relationships but cannot understand why frequent conversations are not good enough.
Once you arrive and experience the Chinese business culture, you will gain a greater understanding of the importance of relationship building and why it is an integral prerequisite for your contact to do business with you.

, Every time you are exposed to a different culture, you gain valuable knowledge and experience that can help you work with additional clients or business partners in that area. Having this experience will allow you to market yourself as an experienced professional who has successfully worked around the world.

Speak out against unionization.,
Refuse to sign the petition.,
Refuse to sign an authorization card.,
Circulate your own petition against unionization.,
Vote ""no"" in an election.",How to Vote Against Unionization1," Before a union can file a petition with the NLRB, it must show sufficient interest in unionization among workers in a designated group. At this point, you potentially have the most power to persuade your coworkers that unionization is not appropriate in your workplace.The union must specify the group of workers, or unit, it will represent. An appropriate unit is a group of workers who share similar interests and generally perform the same work.
Depending on the size of your workplace, there may be several potential units – but you would only belong to one unit. The unionization of other groups of workers in your workplace has no direct effect on you, since that union doesn't represent you.
If the union cannot get a substantial number of employees interested in unionization, it typically won't be granted authority by the NLRB to hold an election. You can stop unionization before it even starts by convincing your coworkers that unionization is not in their best interests.
Point out the costs of the union to employees. In addition to regular dues employees will be forced to pay, strikes can result in significant wage loss that you can't do anything about as a worker in a unionized workplace.
Workers face other costs in terms of a loss of individuality and loss of control over their own relationship with their employer. Since promotions in unionized shops typically are based on seniority, workers will lose the ability to rise in the workplace by virtue of their own hard work.;
, If your coworkers are interested in unionizing, their first step is to gather signatures on a petition, which they will submit to the NLRB. The NLRB cannot conduct an election to certify a representative unless a petition is filed requesting one.The NLRA doesn't specify a number of signatures required, but it must be a substantial number of employees that are interested in unionization and want to hold an election to certify a representative.
If you don't want your workplace to be unionized, don't sign this petition. You also should encourage your coworkers not to sign the petition. Tell your coworkers that the union will cost them money, and they will lose the ability to bargain with your employer individually for better wages or hours.
You can also point out the costs to each employee that will begin from the moment the NLRB approves an election.

, A union can gain certification by having employees sign authorization cards stating that the person who signed the card authorizes the union to be his or her representative.The union can be certified if the union gets a majority of their coworkers, or 50 percent plus one person, to sign authorization cards.
In other words, if there are 500 workers in the group seeking unionization, the union must get signed authorization cards from 251 workers.
Keep in mind that pro-union workers typically approach their coworkers one on one to request signatures on authorization cards, so you may be asked more than once.
If you don't want your workplace to be unionized, don't sign one of these cards. You also may want to talk to your coworkers and attempt to convince others not to sign authorization cards.
Point out to your coworkers that a secret election would be preferable to union recognition by authorization cards. Particularly if the union is pressuring your fellow workers to sign cards, you might mention that these pressure tactics indicate how little respect the union has for the free will of workers to make their own decisions and control their own relationship with their employer.
Even if one of your coworkers has already signed an authorization card, he or she can sign a letter, card, or other document rescinding that authorization.
If the union gathers authorization cards from a majority of the workers in the group, it can present these cards to your employer and ask your employer to voluntarily recognize the union. If your employer refuses to voluntarily recognize union representation on the basis of the cards, the union will petition the NLRB to conduct a secret election.

, Write down your specific points or arguments against unionization and provide blanks for coworkers to sign your petition. You have the right to circulate this petition among your coworkers and submit it to your employer, union officials, or the NLRB.If you get significant support on your petition, you might consider holding a meeting or rally with anti-union coworkers. Your meeting would help everyone get on the same page with their arguments against unionization.
In your petition, point out that unionizing would cost employees money directly out of their pockets, as well as decreasing flexibility and control over their jobs and their livelihoods.
You might also want to reach out to any nearby workers in your industry who have successfully fought the unionization of their workplace. Invite them to speak at your workplace or get tips on how to combat unionization.
Keep in mind that any activity to campaign against unionization must be done on non-work time, such as during breaks, and in non-work areas such as break rooms or the parking lot.
National organizations such as the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation have websites with resources on your rights, and on fighting unionization in your workplace.

, The other method of having a union certified is a secret election. The NLRB will hold an election in which each employee in the group has the opportunity to vote for or against unionization.You may have multiple options, depending on whether multiple unions are competing to be the representative of your group.
Generally, you have the choice of either choosing a named union as your representative, or choosing ""no representation.""
If you vote ""no representation,"" this means you do not want unionization.
If more than 50 percent of the workers in your designated group vote ""no representation,"" your workplace will not be unionized.
However, if 50 percent of the workers in your group vote for the union, the union automatically will become your exclusive representative in collective bargaining.
While you don't have to become a member of the union, you still are represented by it and cannot negotiate individually with your employer regarding employment issues such as wages, hours, and working conditions.

Talk to your coworkers about decertifying the union.,
Circulate a decertification petition.,
Submit your decertification petition to the NLRB.,
Reach out to anti-unionization experts.,
Hold an election.,
Vote to decertify the union.",How to Vote Against Unionization2," Emphasize the problems you and your coworkers have had with the union, and the reasons employees are worse off under the union than they were before unionization.For example, if the union is interfering with employee-supervisor communication, or decreasing employee satisfaction with management, you might remind your coworkers that these problems didn't exist before the labor union was certified.
You also might want to note the decrease in flexibility and individuality created by union representation.
If any of your coworkers share stories about how the union has cost them money or had a negative impact on their lives or workplace satisfaction, get permission to type these stories up and share them as part of your decertification campaign.

, Once a union wins a certification election, it becomes your representative for the purposes of collective bargaining. However, with signatures of 30 percent of your coworkers, you can hold an election to decertify that union, effectively de-unionizing your workplace.Once a union is certified, you must wait one year before requesting a decertification election.
If the union and your employer reach a collective-bargaining agreement, you generally must wait three years before you can request a decertification election.
During that first three years, however, there is a 30-day ""window period"" during which you can request a decertification election. This period begins 90 days before the collective-bargaining agreement is set to expire.
If you believe support for the union has diminished, you can circulate a decertification petition among coworkers within the group the union represents.

, Once you have the signatures of at least 30 percent of the workers in the group represented by the union who are interested in having a decertification election, you must submit your decertification petition to your nearest NLRB regional office.The NLRB has 26 regional offices. If you're unsure which office to use, you can use the regional office map, located on the NLRB's website at https://www.nlrb.gov/who-we-are/regional-offices.
The petition requires you to provide basic information about your employer, the union, and the individual or organization filing the petition.
The petition form must be accompanied by proof that at least 30 percent of the workers currently represented by the union want to have a decertification election.
A competing union also can file a petition seeking to represent the group. This petition must be supported by at least 30 percent of the employees in the group indicating they are interested in being represented by that union.

, Many national organizations, as well as individuals such as politicians and attorneys, can provide expert advice on decertifying your union and fighting against unionization.For example, the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation provides free legal advice and assistance to people who feel their rights have been violated by unionization. You can request advice or information by filling out the form at http://www.nrtw.org/en/legal.htm.
A labor attorney also can evaluate the union's actions in your workplace. If the union is violating labor laws, this can be a tremendous argument in favor of decertifying the union.
If you know of a local politician or government representative who is anti-union, you might consider asking him or her to speak at your workplace.

, Provided your petition was properly filed and accepted by the NLRB, it will conduct a decertification election through which the workers in your group will have the option of voting to decertify the union.The election typically is held at the earliest possible date after your petition is accepted and the regional director orders an election.
If there is a competing union seeking to represent the same group of employees, the election would be a three-way race between the two unions and no union representation at all.

, When the decertification election is held, vote ""no representation"" if you want unionization in your workplace to end.The union will be decertified if a simple majority of the employees in the group vote for no representation. For example, if there are 200 workers in the group represented by the union, 101 of them must vote for ""no representation"" for the union to be decertified.
If the election is a three-way race between two competing unions and no representation, and none of them receive a majority of the vote in the first election, the NLRB will hold a second run-off election between the top two vote-getters.

Arrive at a decision.,
Inform the employee of your decision.,
Inform the employee of what to do differently.,
Monitor the employee's performance after the meeting.,
Arrange for follow-up meetings as needed.",How to Manage a Disciplinary Meeting," Before you hold a disciplinary meeting for an employee, it's imperative that you thoroughly review the incident at hand. The investigation may entail interviewing other employees or witnesses for details on the incident. Make sure a representative from Human Resources is present during all interviews.Ask anyone you interview to sign an accurately-written dictation of their statement.
Compile and review the evidence for and against the employee. If the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the employee was at fault, you'll need to proceed to disciplinary proceedings.
Document everything that is said about the incident and about the employee, including by the employee himself or herself.For minor infractions or first-time offenses, an informal, verbal warning is usually sufficient. For more serious infractions or repeat offenses, a formal disciplinary meeting may be called for.;
, Your employee has a right to know that an investigation is being conducted and may lead to a disciplinary meeting. You do not want to withhold this information, as blindsiding an employee with disciplinary measures typically violates most companies' human resources policies., Once you've decided to proceed with a disciplinary meeting, you'll need to make arrangements for the actual meeting. Choose a date and time that is convenient for your schedule and is feasible for the employee's schedule (for example, at a time when the employee is scheduled to be in the office).


The location of the meeting should be someplace private that will not be interrupted. Privacy is important for both following protocol and maintaining workplace morale.

, After you've reserved a location for the meeting and scheduled a date and time, you'll need to inform your employee. The employee's notice should be delivered in writing so that they have a written document that details the incident and the coming procedure.The notice should include the details of the allegation. It should also notify the employee of the date, time, and location of the disciplinary meeting, as well as any attendees who will be present.
Depending on your employer's policies and the rules that pertain to disciplinary hearings, you may also be required to allow the employee to bring a union representative or work colleague. This should be mentioned in the written notice.

, It's best to have a representative from human resources (HR) present at any and all disciplinary meetings. This is beneficial to both the employee and to you as the manager.Employees may see an HR representative's presence as a form of protection against unfair disciplinary proceedings.
As a manager, you may want an HR representative there to serve as a witness.

, It's best to begin the meeting by reminding the employee of what they did wrong. Whether it's a behavioral problem or a job performance issue, reviewing what happened and why it was a problem is an imperative first step in the disciplinary process.Be clear and complete in your summary of the allegations/infractions. Do not leave out any details, and make sure the employee understands what incident is being reviewed and why.
If the allegations involve some infraction of the law, you may not be able to disclose all the details to the employee. This is particularly true if a criminal investigation is ongoing or pending.
Consult with a police officer before proceeding if the employee is or may be under criminal investigation.

, After reiterating the allegations against the employee, it's a good idea to contrast that behavior with the prescribed standards of conduct and performance at your company. This will help clarify what the employee did wrong and what should have been done differently. Reviewing the standards also helps protect management from any allegations that the employee was unclear on the rules. It reminds the employee that the rules are clearly written and available to all employees., Now that the employee has been reminded of what should have been done differently and why, you'll want to inform the employee of what your company can legally do to reprimand that infraction. The employee should be clear on what management can and cannot do in response to the bad behavior, and you should lay out all of the disciplinary options available at your disposal.While you may not have arrived at a ruling on the matter, it's important that the employee understands what may end up happening after the proceedings.
Reviewing the company's disciplinary policy also helps protect management from allegations of unfair treatment.

, The decision in your disciplinary meeting will depend on the nature of your employee's infraction/misconduct as well as the disciplinary policy in place at your company. In general, minor infractions warrant minor disciplinary measures, while more serious infractions warrant more serious measures.


Serious infractions may include theft, assault, or significant acts of insubordination.Maintain the notes you take as you deliberate on a decision. These notes and any supporting documents from the investigation and meeting should be kept in either the employee's personnel file or in a secure, locked location.

, Once you've arrived at a decision, you'll need to inform your employee of what will happen next. Depending on your company's policies, you may want to deliver the decision in writing to the employee, or at least offer a written explanation in addition to a verbal announcement.Keep the decision confidential. The only people you should tell are the employee, their union representative (if they have one), and the HR representative who served as a witness.
If the employee is to be suspended, a short, follow-up suspension meeting should be scheduled.
Different employers may have different disciplinary policies, but in general, a verbal warning is the first form of discipline. Verbal warnings are usually followed by written reprimands, suspension, and eventual termination., The goal of disciplinary proceedings is not to punish the employee so much as to correct bad behavior and performance issues. As such, you may need to give your employee some reminders from time to time on what they should be doing differently.Give clear examples. Describe what should have been done differently in the incident that was investigated, and provide hypothetical examples of similar situations.
Don't be overbearing and don't correct your employee in front of their coworkers. Assess the situation and ask to speak in private as needed.

, As time goes on, your employee should have learned from the disciplinary meeting. They should implement the changes you've recommended, and their behavior (whether good or bad) should be monitored over time.Look for both improvements and future infractions. Praise the employee for corrected behavior, and give verbal input on behavior that still needs to be corrected.

, If the employee's behavior or performance does not change to meet the company's expectations, future conversations may be necessary with the employee. These conversations may lead to further disciplinary meetings, or they could be as simple as offering feedback and guidance, depending on the nature of the infraction and the employee's response to feedback."

Gather appraisals from subordinates.,
Perform a self-appraisal.,
Collect colleague feedback.,
Compile supervisor evaluations.,
Understand the limitations of 360-degree evaluations.",How to Measure Performance1," Ensure the appraisals are anonymous, so the employees have no fear of reprisal. A 360-degree appraisal has the benefit of accurately assessing a manager’s ability to manage and lead.Something similar to one of the following items could lead subordinates to open up about their supervisors:


”Do you feel your supervisor does a good job leading the team?”
”Give an example of where your supervisor could improve his or her leadership style.”
”Provide an instance where your supervisor excelled in his or her job.”;
, Self-appraisals are a great option. Employees are given the opportunity to appraise themselves. An employee is likely to look at their own strengths and weaknesses differently than others. Most will overstate their performance. The major benefit to the 360 evaluation is that the self-appraisal is complemented by the mix of ideas from other evaluations. Leading questions like the following can help an employee delve deeply into their performance:


”What situations have you excelled at in the past?”
”What are some examples of when you could have used time more wisely?”
”What will your fellow employees, from supervisor to subordinate, say about your performance?”

, Feedback from your peers helps you improve at your job because they know the type of dedication and work that is required for the position. Colleague assessments are particularly adept at helping an employ who is analyzing their positives and negatives”Where does your colleague rank in comparison to others with a similar position?”
”How can your peer improve his or her performance?”
”Provide an example of how your peer has shown job competency.”

, Superiors typically provide an overhead view of employees’ roles, responsibilities, and work quality. They also assess employee production. They would best know whether an employee is ready for a promotion or demotion, based upon their quality and output. Questions similar to the following may work well from a supervisor perspective:


”Do you feel the employee performs satisfactorily?”
”In which way could the employee improve their job performance?”
”Why or why isn’t the employee ready for advancement?”

, 360-Degree feedback methods are very subjective and responses generally depend upon the relationships between the appraiser and appraised. Accordingly, you should never use a 360-degree appraisal as your only appraisal method."
"
Use quantitative measurements.,
Compare quantitative plans, goals, and results.,
Use measurements to create a plan of action.",How to Measure Performance2," Performance appraisals of this type are typically subjective, rather than objective. They are most valuable when objective criteria such as as production rate, cycle time, cost, and error rate are used. Each department should have its own quantifiable measurements so work can be compared to pre-determined standards, group norms, trends, and employee-to-employee. Collect the data systematically, and determine if the guidelines being used to conduct business are adequate.For example, you might track the amount of time a customer waits in line.
Regularly document the number of items or reports an employee can produce in an hour.
Be sure to clearly communicate performance measures and expected performance to employees before measurement begins. Training in this areas might be required.

, When the data collection begins, set plans and goals for job performance. Once the data has been collected, measure it to see if your goals were achieved. If not, a baseline can be established and used to set goals for improvement throughout the organization. If customers typically wait in line for 3 minutes before being addressed, strive to lower the customer response time.
Conflict resolution through customer support can be a daunting task. Once you know the amount of time a typical call takes, it can help your company streamline the process by identifying which calls take longer.
Use percentage-based quantitative improvement goals. If the company sold $500,000 worth of product last quarter, attempt to increase sales by 1%.

, Progress must be measured and acted upon. If a performance measurement is lacking, periodic measurement needs to occur to ensure progress is being made. The measurements also serve to determine whether or not the plan of action is working.Utilize exemplary programs to serve as a guide for those that are lacking.
Do not hesitate to change a plan if measurement shows no progress is being made.

Evaluate employee work quality.,
Conduct comprehensive employee assessments.,
Establish random quality control checks.,
Solicit customer feedback.",How to Measure Performance3," Performance of employees reflects upon all facets of their work, from work ethic to individual achievements. This method of assessment would look at each employee as a whole on an annual basis. This assessment would provide suggestions and an opportunity to improve, while recognizing any excellence.How much an individual is able to produce either in product or sales.
The quality of work produced.
How quickly an employee produces a product or makes a sale.

, Comprehensive evaluations may help identify potential solutions, particularly if your company is undergoing problems. However, it is more common that problems result from poorly designed processes, inadequate training, or poor management. Generally, a review of the entire process, with inputs, outputs, actions and deliverables, is required to resolve complex or complicated problems.


Hiring a professional assessor who can impartially appraise the everyday functionality of your business, as well as the performance of your employees, could be very beneficial.

, The obvious benefit to this approach is that your company employees may be aware of the checks, but they won't know when checks will occur. Consequently, employees that are slacking in some way or not performing to par will be exposed. Try a few different approaches so employees are on their toes.


Perform random spot checks on products.
Randomly review phone calls.
Inspect log books at random intervals.

, Client satisfaction should be your ultimate mission. Customer service experience can be used as a way of assessing employee performance. Ask customers if they are satisfied with their product or service. Getting an outside perspective on performance is smart, as it offers the potential of an objective analysis.Be cautious of overly harsh customer feedback. Some industries and businesses, such as repossession of vehicles, is bound to have overly negative reviews.
Develop feedback tools or forms so the feedback can be standardized and weighed equally.
Customer feedback is always subjective and generally only from those customers with bad experiences. Balance any review with objective measures of customer service, such as time on hold, resolution of problems, and call-backs.

"
Measure time spent on particular tasks.,
Give regular, but not too frequent, feedback.,
Note lapses in workplace decorum.",How to Measure Performance4," One way to measure time management is to assess the time and employee spends on a project. However, you should only use those measures that can be collected automatically such as time cards or computer software. For most jobs, manual reporting, such as entering data into a timesheet, is neither reliable nor cost-effective.


There are multiple software programs that can track what is being done on a computer. This way, you can investigate employees who are not meeting performance standards to see what they are having trouble with.
If specific employees are falling far below the average, they can be singled-out and helped to meet the performance requirements.

, While feedback is important, daily monitoring is a two-edged sword that can be a morale buster. It also shifts performance responsibilities from management to a tool. It's better to use weekly or monthly measures. In addition, use bonuses instead of humiliation to encourage employees, and keep individual performance figures confidential.

, One manner of measuring performance is to make note of how an employee adheres to company policies. To monitor these lapses, try the following methods:]

Monitor punctuality issues. Employees who are habitually late are naturally missing minutes they could be working. What’s worse, they could be upsetting other employees.
Check for dress code violations. An employee that is relaxed on their professional appearance is likely to exhibit the same approach to their actual work.Clarify usage of workplace items. Be sure employees know how and when they may use company items like a car, cell phone, or computer. Employees abusing company materials are not using time wisely."

Be aware of the role of the ROA, the ROE, and the ROCE.,
Get the necessary financial data from the company accountant.,
Analyze the ROA data.,
Examine the ROE data.,
Look at the ROCE data.",How to Measure Management Effectiveness1," There are three important financial ratios in a company, the Return on Assets (ROA), the Return on Equity (ROE), and the Return on investments (ROCE). These three ratios can be used to determine how monetarily successful the company is and how management has contributed or detracted from this success.The ROA looks at how the business is using shareholder assets to earn returns. You can calculate the ROA by dividing the company’s net income by the company’s total assets.
The ROE looks at the return generated by using shareholder capital, which is the equity capital invested by shareholders and their share of the earnings. You can calculate the ROE by dividing the company’s earnings by the company’s shareholder equity.
The ROCE is the company’s return on all the capital it employs, including debt funds like loans and preference capital. You can calculate the ROCE by dividing the company’s return before interest and tax by the company’s capital employed.;
, Your company accountant should have company data that can be used to calculate the company’s ROA, ROE, and ROCE. These three ratios are useful as a measure of management effectiveness because they can provide hard data on how management has affected the business’ returns, and how effectively the business’s capital has been managed., The Return on Assets data can be a useful way to determine how much of a profit the company has made over several years compared to other companies in the same industry. Look over the ROA data and note how much profit was derived from the company assets. The higher the ratio, the better the company is doing in ROA.For example, if the total assets of your company is Rs 10 million and if the company has a net income of Rs 20 million, the ROA would be 20/10, or 2. This means that for Rs 1 in assets, the company made a profit of Rs 2.
You should look at the ROA over a period of at least two to four years to notice if there is an increasing trend in the ROA over a period of time. An increasing trend of ROA is an indication the company is improving and a decreasing trend of ROA is an indication the company is not doing well. You may then be able to determine if management is effective or ineffective based on how well the company’s ROA looks.
You can also break down the ROA into formulas like ROA = Net Profit Margin x Total Asset Turnover or ROA = (Net Income/Revenue) x (Revenue/Total Assets). You can then look at which areas management is focusing on to maximize the company returns. You may be able to then note if management is cutting costs, turning over more assets, or increasing prices for products., The Return on Equity can help you get a better sense of how effective management is at using shareholder funds and if they achieve a good rate of return from shareholder funds. You can breakdown the ROE into (Earnings/Sales) x (Sales/Assets) x (Assets/Shareholder’s equity). The ROE can then tell you more about the company’s earning/profits, the company’s assets, and the company’s leverage.If the company has a low profit margin or low earnings, this may mean management is not doing a great job at pricing products, is not regulating unprofitable products, and is not efficient at cost control. This can also mean management is not responding to the competition well and the company is then forced to sell products at a low margin. A high profit margin sheds a kinder light on management, as this means the company has become a monopoly in the industry and can sell products at a high profit margin.
The company’s sales/assets amount will be a measurement of the sales generated from the assets invested by the company. If the company has to heavily invest its assets to generate sales, this mean be a sign management is not investing the assets smartly or effectively. A high amount of capital investment could mean the company is not performing at the level it should.
If the company’s leverage or debt is high, it is an indication that the company has to use a high amount of debt (borrowing from banks, financiers, investors) to sustain itself. This may be a sign that management is not managing shareholder equity efficiently and may need to be more effective at using leverage to the company’s advantage.

, The Return on investments can be broken down into Return (before interest and tax) / capital employed. In order for your company to remain in business for a sustainable period of time, the ROCE should be higher than the cost of capital. The cost of capital is the compensation that the company pays to each category capital contributor.If the ROCE is not higher than the capital employed, this may be an indication that your management team is not using the capital employed effectively and may put the company at risk of defaulting on loans and other debt funds.

Consider your company’s key performance indicators.,
Create and distribute an employee survey and a client survey based on the key performance indicators.,
Process the feedback to gauge managerial effectiveness.",How to Measure Management Effectiveness2," Before you can collect feedback on your management team from employees and clients, you will need to consider your company’s key performance indicators (KPIs) for managers, which should identify a manager’s roles and responsibilities, as well as the targets used to measure her performance. You may establish KPIs for managers at your company that include:Asking what needs to be done for employees and for the company.
Developing employee action plans and employee goals.
Taking responsibility for decision making, communication, and overall functioning of employees.
Creating opportunities for employees and for the company.
Running productive employee meetings.
Using a “we” approach instead of an “I” approach.

, Use the key performance indicators for your management team to create a survey for employees and a survey for clients that measure the effectiveness of management.


The survey for employees should cover all the key performance indicators for management and ask employees to use examples to illustrate how well or how poor management is doing. You may structure the survey online based on a points system or using a short answer format. You should also note that all feedback will be confidential and will only be shared with management if it is considered valuable or important for the growth of management effectiveness.
The survey for clients should look at how management interacts with clients on a daily basis and how effective management is at communicating with clients. Some managers may have more direct contact with clients than others, so you may need to customize the survey to fit the role of your management team.

, Once employees and clients complete the surveys, you should collect the data and go through them. Look at how each manager scored in the employee feedback and the client feedback, and how the management team scored as a whole.


If management scored low on communication and productive meetings with clients, for example, you may highlight this as something to address in your training of management. If management scores high on developing employee goals and action items, you may note this when you share the feedback with management as a positive takeaway of the surveys.

Correct deficiencies in the plan.",How to Manage a Company," Your first step should be to see exactly where you fit in the management of the company. Start by examining its organizational structure. The complexity of this structure will largely depend on the size of the company. As CEO, you may be in charge of several other executives and a few dozen employees or dozens of executives and thousands of employees.


Look at different divisions within the company to see how operations are separated and carried out.
Depending on the executive structure of the company, you might be reported to directly by all employees or by executives like the chief financial officer (CFO) and various vice presidents.;
, The CEO might be the founder or owner of the company, and therefore would only be responsible for reporting to other large shareholders. However, in many cases, the CEO reports to a board of directors or the owner of the company. In this way, they act as the operation hand of the board, carrying out their decisions. A CEO may also work in tandem with another executive, like a vice president or chairman, to make key business decisions. Make sure to clearly assess who you are responsible for reporting to., When you report to the board or owner, if you are required to do so, you will report on new operational plans and/or the progress of existing plans. These might include both short-term and long-term plans. Progress must be reported at regular intervals, depending on the board requirements. In addition, the board will likely require that the CEO report to them on the financial health of the company quarterly and annually.


The CEO might also be responsible for assessing the performance of subordinate executives and reporting their findings to the board., The CEOs duties vary between organizations as well. You may be responsible for coming up with a new direction for the company or more narrowly focus on improving a single metric. To be successful, you'll have to figure out exactly how your performance will be measured. If the board expects you to take the company in a new direction and you focus on increasing sales, you may be replaced.


Ask for specific goals so that you can create a plan for reaching them and carry out that plan., The CEO must be conscious of all of the company's resources, including both capital and people. They need to know how much of each to allocate to the different departments and how to do so efficiently to reach the best results. Identify company assets like cash reserves and other liquid assets that can be used when needed. Assess the needs of the company as they apply to your plan, prioritizing the most important aspects and providing them with resources first.


Successful distribution of resources requires that you clearly understand the operations and limitations of the company., The first step towards instituting a new operational plan is figuring what you're starting with. Look over existing strategic, operational, and marketing plans to get a sense of the past goals of the company. Then, you can look at financial performance over preceding years by examining financial statements from those years.


Look at the successes and failures of old operational plans and projects. Try to identify why they were or were not successful., When implementing your own operational plan, you'll need to know what you can count on. The strengths of the company and its workers should be used to your advantage wherever possible. Worker strengths might include subject matter knowledge, a large amount of experience, a high level of skill, and commitment to the goals of the company, among others.


Focus on taking advantage of your workforce's strengths to improve performance and employee wellbeing., Similarly, you have to understand your team's weaknesses so that you can work around them and make plans to solve them. Weaknesses might include poor quality, low levels of performance, excessive costs, a lack of cohesive organization, or an inability to meet schedules, among others. Look at issues with employer performance, workplace culture, employee turnover, and processes to identify weaknesses., There may be a variety of problems in your workforce or organization. These can sometimes be worked around and hidden, but only for a time. To actually solve them, you will need to prioritize each issue and work to solve them one at a time. For example, you might solve cultural problems by leading by example, showing your management and employees how to promote an efficient working environment., Your operational plan will be meaningless if its success cannot be measured. Establish measurable and specific performance metrics so that your progress and eventual success can be tracked. These metrics must be quantifiable targets that can be reached as you work through your plan. When they are reached, the plan can be considered a success.


Metrics should be bound by a certain time limit.
For example, you might set an objective of raising sales by 10 percent in two years or improving employee retention by 20 percent in the next five years., Set goals by first identifying your strategic objectives. What change do you most want to make in your organization? Your answer should be a mix of your own objectives and those of your shareholders and customers. However, these objectives should be grounded in reality. There's no way you're going to control the whole market for your product or double your sales in a year. Ground your objectives by cutting them into measurable and attainable goals.


These should be actions that lead to an expected result, like training your sales team on maintaining customer relationships to increase repeat sales by 3 percent.
This goal might be one aspect of the larger goal of increasing sales by 10 percent over a few years., Management styles fall broadly into two categories: people-focused and process-focused. People-focused strategies rely on hiring, training, and retaining the best people, allowing them to improve processes themselves. Process-focused strategies, on the other hand, focus on creating perfect business processes first and then training existing staff on them. In most cases, effective management will incorporate both of them. However, you will likely need to focus on one in the immediate term.


Your choice of one of these styles will be up to you, and will largely depend on the process and your own confidence in your abilities to increase performance using one strategy., In your role as the middleman between the board and company, you must communicate your operational plan and research to the board. Be prepared to defend your strategy and reasoning, as the board will likely be very interested in any significant operational changes. Get their approval on the final plan before moving forward. This may end up taking several versions of the plan and going back and forth between the board and your planning team., To begin implementing the operational plan, you will need to get all relevant employees on board. This is best handled in meetings where management is able to meet directly with employees and present the plan to them, addressing any questions or concerns they may have. The plan itself can be broken down into parts and presented separately in more detail to the teams that will be handling those parts.


If necessary, train employees who will using a new system or equipment as part of plan implementation., Schedule regular meetings, perhaps biweekly or monthly, to track plan implementation and success. These only have to be 30 minutes or an hour long, but should allow for departments to report on their progress. Make sure that all progress is reported in terms of your established metrics. This way, you can easily track progress across teams and departments., After a few months of plan implementation, take a step back to review implementation success. What has gone well and what is not going so well? Look at areas where implementation has gone smoothly and those areas where it hasn't. Work to assess why these areas are not performing as strongly and reassess your strategy to work past it. Hold meetings with representatives from those departments so that you can work out solutions."
"
Define your problem.,
Ensure it is your decision to make.,
Analyze the problem by researching.,
Write down any limiting factors for your decision.,
Write down a list of possible solutions.,
Ask a team, employee or other manager to improve on the solutions.,
Do a cost-benefit analysis of the possible solutions.,
Consider the support you will need.,
Make the decision yourself.,
Create a plan for implementing the decision.,
Schedule follow up action.",How to Make Management Decisions," Write down the situation you need to change, keeping in mind all underlying factors.;
, If it is a decision that affects people outside of your management reach, you may want to ask other managers to make a joint decision with you.

, Request evidence from anyone who has identified the problem or worked on it. List the factors, claims and opinions in bulleted form, but make sure to list the evidence underneath each, or it is not useful to an educated decision.

, For instance, time, money, personnel or supplies, are factors that should be taken into account with any decision.

, After examining the evidence, you should be ready to suggest a few possibilities.

, Some studies have shown that instead of brainstorming, or allowing people to suggest many different creative solutions, you should ask people to improve on several alternatives. Allow people to be critical about ideas and suggest solutions to expand an idea.


Weigh your short-term and long-term goals. Make sure your decision can keep both sets of goals in mind. If it cannot, then you may require some advice from the parties involved to help improve it.

, Ask for the help of a financial analyst to run the numbers, if necessary. Estimate the costs of each decision and the financial growth or benefit they would provide. Cut out any ideas where the benefits do not outweigh the costs.


If you are lacking the numbers to do a cost-benefit analysis, do some experimentation. Run a report or gather data while you make the decision. Experiment with a small group or market research.

, Many employees and managers like to stay with the status quo. In this case, decide who's support is required to successfully carry out your decision, and invite them in to discuss and improve on the idea.


In some cases, you may need to make trade-offs to gain support. Decision-making within a company structure may require some negotiations; however, a decision that lacks follow through is unlikely to be successful.

, Let people who have given input know when you will make the final decision. They should know that it is in your hands, but that you are seeking their valued input.


Many management books talk about making ""gut"" decisions. These decisions are intuitive choices based on your knowledge of the company. The best decisions are made with evidence to support them, but you may need to rely on your ""gut"" to tell you whether they will be feasible within your company culture.

, Announce your decision with an adoption process already in mind. People are more likely to start something new if they are given steps for implementation.

, All managers must change or adjust decisions, if they do not solve the problem. Set a date for a review period, where you can examine the evidence and improve upon your decision.

",How to Manage People More Effectively," A Manager should be well aware of a team member’s goals and strive hard to ensure that they succeed in achieving goals. In my experience I have learn that all individual have goals and that inspires them to work hard. The goals can be anything like promotion, Car, House, Technical knowledge improvement, etc. Also if a team member is looking forward to move to a different team in your organization do not find any reason to stop the team member. He would do no good staying back. Example: - Carlos goal is to develop himself in windows and SQL domain; you have a limited work in your team. May be you can share some documents, videos, training that will help him develop himself in free time.;
, All the modern organizations set goals at the beginning of the year and expect each team to work hard on achieving them throughout the year. This is the biggest opportunity to make the best of the talented bunch of people in your team. Lay down clear and concise goals in alignment with your organization and work hard with team to achieve them. A team without goals is like a car without steering. Often goals are used as an important steering factor to keep team focused at work. A good thought on Goals,” Set your sights high, the higher the better”.

, The biggest challenge for a manager is optimum utilization of resources. A manager should ensure that resources are kept busy at work. As we all are aware,” An empty mind is devil’s workshop”. In my views this is toughest job however not impossible. If you have limited work you involve team members in Knowledge base creations, training, tasks etc. Keeping the team members will ensure that they all are focused at work and not indulging in any wrong activities.

, Implement measures to perform a random monitoring of work done by team members as well implement quality audit measure for the team. This will ensure that the team will always be giving their best on deliverables. Also spare some time in sharing the feedback with the team members. This will result in to overall development of team and quality deliverables at workplace.

, Although it’s a modern civilization, set very high standards for work ethics, principles and discipline at work. Today in this competitive world people go at any extent to stay on the top. Always share the importance of ethics, principles and discipline at work. Have severe punishments for team members for cheating at work. The most important part is discipline where you the manager play the most important role.

, As said by someone,” A leader leads by example, whether he intends to or not”. The team members look at you and follow you. It’s very important that you as a manager set good example for team members in terms of work, professionalism, ethics, principle and discipline. The team will follow you and do what you do. Stretching for a critical deliverables and sitting down with team members for moral support will be a good example.

, As mentioned by A Cohen, ”Appreciation is the highest form of prayer, for it acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts.” As a manager it’s very important to recognize good deeds of team members. This will inspire and motivate them to achieve more and contribute more. Also imagine you took an initiative for team and it resulted in success however your superior doesn’t recognize or appreciate it. This is exactly the feeling that team members get when they are not recognize. As a leader you have authority and power to recognize team members however do that with your best judgment and experience.

, As mentioned above, set goals for team members and calculate their achievements on those goals on monthly basis. This will made the team members realize the areas that they need to improve. This will certainly produce tremendous results for the organization. Also will set the right expectation among team members about what rating they should expect at the end of the year. I have implemented this and produce tremendous results for my organization.

, As said by Saint Augustine,” Punishment is justice for the unjust”. As a human being we don’t really like to punish anybody. Always remember in life we are playing different roles example: Manager, teacher, guide, etc. We need to ensure that we do justified things for the role. If at all after number of requests and warnings we do not see improvement in a team member, he/she deserves to be punished. Collect all the data about the team member’s deed and punished the team members for the wrong deed. Typically now the managers have to report the incidents to the Human Resource department for appropriate action.

, As a manager you got to ensure that you used all your resources optimally. Under utilization and over staffing of resources leads to huge financial loss for the company. In today’s competitive world we have to be very diligent about the costs to the company and avoid all the bottle necks leading to high costs.

, An outing with team members is a perfect opportunity to break the barrier with them. It is also an important listening forum to understand what team members are conversing about. Team members might get a little cozy about what other company’s have to offer and what are good aspects of other organizations during such outings. Make a point to listen to these points and implement them in your organization if within your capacity. Outing with team members once in a month or may be quarter is refreshing break from work and a great good together of professional friends.

, Begin your day full of enthusiasm and positive energy. As said by Robert Collier,” There is little difference in people, but that little difference makes a big difference. That little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative”. Be very positive in all the task you complete and use the positive energy ins generating great results for the team.

, Today business is managed by series of leaders and each team across organization has a leader for effective management. Naturally to grow some mediocre kinds will attempt to play foul games and stop your growth. In such situations do not lose focus. Just stay focused on your task and complete the tasks exceptionally well. The higher management needs results and put your focus on generating results. This way they would look into getting you down while you will keep generating results.

, When team members are approaching you with a problem take some time to understand the root cause of the problem. Understand the fact that they are reaching you as they trust you and your abilities to solve their problems. Act as a very powerful problem solver and guide the team members effectively. Use the treasure of your experience to solve the problems. You may also relate some problems with your mentors for effective solutions.

, Utilize your time very well. Time management is the key to success for effective management personal. Plan your day effectively and implement all your plans for the day. If you have spare time indulge in learning something new and develop yourself. Spend majority of your time in planning and preparing your team for future.

, Once a manager, you're always a manager. Remember it doesn’t take an MBA from MIT to manage people effectively, what it really takes is a passionate spirit who loves the job. Be passionate and love your job. As said by Steve Jobs,” The only way to do great work is to love what you do”. In my experience I observed that my love and passion for my work has really helped me grow professionally as well as generated tremendous results for my organization.

, This is a time where you can share the right feedback to the team members. Also its great opportunity for team members to share their concerns with you. There are some items which you cannot share with team members in front of others so 1:1 can be used to discuss these items. As a manager utilize this opportunity to provide constructive feedback to team members and develop them.

, The more you grow be humble and generous to people. You have been identified to be a leader as you have been a great performer and you have some great qualities in terms of people management. Be kind to your team members. Be very humble to them in attending issues. Put yourself in their shoes and realize what they are going through. Forgive honest mistakes.

Consider finding a therapist.",How to Maintain Professional Boundaries in Social Work," It is important to provide all of your clients with a list of numbers to call in an emergency. Otherwise, your clients may try to contact you and only you. Make sure that you provide your clients with numbers for your office, an after-hours answering service, 24 hour call centers, emergency services, and local community organizations., Telling clients to contact you at all hours and giving out your personal cell phone number, e-mail, or home address, may lead to an unprofessional dynamic. It may also cause your client to lose trust if for some reason you do not answer your phone or you cannot help.


Always provide a professional work email, phone number, and office location for your clients to use to contact you., Your client might be tempted to ""friend"" you on Facebook or another form of social media. But interacting with your client in this context could breach professional boundaries.Make sure your Facebook settings and other on-line profiles are set to private or limited to people you have approved to follow you. If your client can access information about you publicly on-line, this could lead to a conflict of interests.Similarly, do not seek out information about your clients on-line that is private or irrelevant to your work with that client.

, It is imperative that you do not disclose the details of your client's struggles outside of a professional context. Do not discuss your client with your friends or family members at social gatherings.If you disclose confidential information relating to your client, he or she must sign a valid consent form which gives you permission to do this.If you are discussing confidential information with fellow colleagues or a supervisor, then make sure this is done in private. Do not discuss it in hallways, stairways or other public places where it can be overheard., One of the most effective ways to establish clear professional boundaries is to let your behavior set the standard for your meetings with your client. It is important that you do not touch your client in any inappropriate way.


Inappropriate forms of touching might include hugging, caressing, or holding your client's hand. While you might think these gestures show compassion or care, it is possible they could make your client feel uncomfortable and as if he or she is in an exploitative dynamic.Ask yourself if there is even the smallest possibility your client could be psychologically harmed by your touching. If yes, then avoid making physical contact with your client.In some cases, hugging a client may be appropriate. For example, if a client asks for a hug during your last session together, then that would be appropriate.If you work with children or the elderly, then hugging and hand holding may be appropriate sometimes as well.

, Your style of dress will also signal professional boundaries to your client. Slacks, blazers, blouses, and knee length skirts and dresses are generally appropriate forms of dress.


Avoid wearing any form of low-cut or revealing clothing. This could make your client feel deeply uncomfortable and establish an exploitative dynamic between you and your client., Avoid using profanity, even if your client often speaks this way. You should also avoid using derogatory language, like insults or slurs, even if your client uses this type of language. Make sure your language is always appropriate so your client knows that you are trustworthy and professional., You might feel the urge to discuss your personal problems or difficulties in order to relate to your clients. But your clients benefit more from your professional expertise than your personal life experiences.When you discuss intimate, personal details of your life with your clients, it could confuse your clients about to the nature of your relationship and this could be distressing for your client., Dual relationships are relationships in which you interact with your client in a setting separate from your professional work.


If you are a social worker in a small community, there is a chance you might meet your client in other contexts, such as church, school or in another social setting. Try to limit contact with your client in these situations. The more time you spend with your client outside of a professional context, the greater the opportunity for a breach of professional boundaries.For example, if you attend the same church as your client, avoid joining the same volunteer committee or attending the same Bible study class as your client.
If you run into a client while in the gym or at the grocery store, then try to minimize the encounter. Be polite and professional but do not linger in a social capacity.You should not ignore your client, but do not start a social interaction unless your client approaches you. Do not approach your client.
Similarly, do not agree to do favors for your clients outside of a professional setting. Don't agree to give rides to your client or to babysit for your client. This can easily compromise professional boundaries.

, Sexual or intimate relationships with your current clients are unethical and inappropriate. You cannot have sex with a former or current client and you cannot accept a client with whom you have had an intimate relationship. You may lose your job or be prosecuted for doing so.Former clients could also be harmed by a sexual relationship due to your privileged knowledge of their case work.Never enter into a sexual relationship with any of your clients' relatives or close friends either. These relationships could also potentially exploit your clients and their treatment.
If you find yourself developing romantic feelings toward your client, excuse yourself from the case and refer the person to another social worker., You must never give your client money or accept money or gifts from your client. Do not engage in relationships where your client gives you additional money or gifts for things unrelated to social work.Do not borrow money from or lend funds to current or former clients. These are actions that can easily confuse your client and put your client in an exploitative position in relation to you., One of the best ways to maintain professional boundaries is to have a clear line between your professional life and your social life.Keep in touch with old friends from high school, college or your field work rounds. If you are new to a city, try joining volunteer groups, church groups or intramural sporting teams for basketball, running, baseball, etc.

, If you enjoy reading, watching movies, taking photos, acting in community theater plays, singing in a local choir, then make these activities a robust part of your social life.


Try to find a hobby that gives you regularly, weekly activities. Having something regularly scheduled outside of work will help you maintain professional boundaries while also reducing stress in your daily life.

, Establish clear boundaries for yourself away from the office. Do not check your work e-mail, voicemail or take professional calls when you are at home or on vacation.You can still be an excellent social worker without being available to your clients 24/7.

, Social work can take a huge toll on your mental and physical health, so it is important for you to find someone to talk to about your emotions. Talking to a therapist can help you to feel more balanced and it can also prevent you from being distracted from your own problems during your time with your clients."

Watch local ads, clip coupons, and compare prices on your essential items to make sure that you get the best possible prices on the items that you buy.Consider shopping at bulk retail stores, like Sam's Club or Costco. If you have a friend or family member with a membership, see if they will take you so you don't have to purchase your own membership. Some things can be purchased cheaply at these retailers. Make sure to consider unit price, however, because not all items sold at these stores are cheaper.
Buy generic brands. Most grocery stores carry their own brand of products that sell for significantly less than other brands. This can be a way to reduce your grocery expenses.
Give up certain things. Since you are cutting corners, you can't buy everything you usually do. Items like sodas, expensive meats, and snack foods are unnecessary expenses. Instead, buy what you need to feed you and your family. The extraneous items can be skipped for now.

, Plan ahead before you go grocery shopping. Make a meal plan so that you can cook all of your meals at home. Doing this will take a bit of extra planning and work, but it will save you money in the long run.Pack a lunch and snacks if you will be away from home for the day. Lunch at a restaurant plus the cost of little snacks here and there adds up. Bring a cooler with sandwiches, snacks, and drinks from home if you expect to be out of the house for the day.
Skip your daily trip to the coffee shop and start brewing coffee at home. This can save a significant amount of money weekly.

, Think carefully about things that you do. Keep your air conditioner or heater off to conserve energy. Use candles or battery-powered lamps instead of electricity. Only use water when it's necessary. These small changes can add up to big savings on your utility bills.


Be frugal with your food. Food is an expensive part of life, even if you buy generic and shop at discount stores. Don't eat because you're depressed or bored. Only eat because you have to.

, Due to your financial situation, there may be bills you cannot pay. You need to prioritize the bills that must get paid first. Bills dealing with your living situation, such as house payment, utilities, and food, should be your top priority. Medical expenses come after that. Credit cards and other loans come after living expenses."

Take a lower paying job.,
Consider selling an extra vehicle.,
Sell items online.,
Sell crafts online.,
Rent out a room in your home.,
Offer your services around your community.,
Have a garage sale.",How to Survive if You Cannot Find a Job3," If you cannot find a job in your field, take a lower paying job in the meantime. This will more than likely be at a lower salary, probably minimum wage. Sometimes, you have to swallow your pride and find a way to temporarily pay the bills. There is nothing wrong with working a temporary job to support yourself and your family.


Look for a job that could help build your resume. If you work at a retail store, use it as an opportunity to build your customer service and inventory skills. If you work in fast food, think about it as learning teamwork and job performance under pressure.
Leave yourself time to job hunt. This is just a temporary job. You still want to devote time in finding a full-time job., If you own more than one vehicle, consider selling a vehicle. Not only will you earn some money from selling the vehicle, you will also save on the cost of maintaining and driving that vehicle., Online selling can be a great way to make money to help during difficult times. You can sell clothes, shoes, collectibles, games, electronics, furniture - just about anything in your home. Try sites like eBay and Craigslist to sell your items.


You may need to sell things you would rather keep. Prioritize. Sell items you can part with first, then consider the more important ones. It may be the difference between food or rent and one item.
Look for any collectible items or antiques you have in your home. Some toys, memorabilia, and antiques can sell for a few hundred dollars.

, If you are crafty, try selling things online. Sites like Etsy are craft marketplaces where you can sell your homemade jewelry, clothes, candles, soap, paintings, or anything else. Make sure to balance the price of supplies with how much you are selling. Start small and grow from there.


You may also try going to local craft fairs. This can be a great way to earn money, but beware that getting booths at some of these fairs can be expensive.

, One way you can make extra cash is to rent out a room in your home. If you live in a city, in a popular vacation spot, or a college town, this might be a viable option. Many people rent rooms to short-term and long-term roommates.


Sites like Airbnb.com allow private, local hosts to list their homes as bed and breakfast-type accommodations for people passing through.
Be aware that renting a room to someone can be a serious commitment. Think through this plan before allowing someone to live with you. If you will want them to move out in 2 months instead of 12 or 24 months, this may not be the option for you.

, You can try to find work in your community doing various tasks. Try dog walking, pet or house sitting, cleaning, babysitting, adult care giving, and lawn care. Put up flyers around your neighborhood advertising your services, put an ad in a community-wide bulletin, or use social media, like Facebook, to try to gain business.

, Use your free time to do some much needed cleaning in your home. Instead of throwing out or donating unwanted items, have a garage sale. This is a good way to make extra money for food, gas, or bills.

Remember why you're participating in this activity.,
Realize that it takes time to stop being a beginner at anything.,
Consider whether you're feeling some resentment against others for ""forcing"" you to do the activity.,
Aim for a specific goal.,
Look for examples of people who you can use as role models.,
Practice.,
Tell yourself that you can do it.,
Use everything to help yourself.",How to Stick to an Activity for Yourself," It might be because you want to be good enough to use the skill or activity to get you into a sporting team, to get into college or a specialist school, or to succeed in something you've set your heart on doing. Whatever the reason, remind yourself of the motivating reason so that you can remember why it is important to stick to doing this activity in spite of doubts you may be having.;
, It can be hard to deal with the fact that you're not good at something until you've practiced it a lot. It's just a fact of reality and everyone experiences this to some extent––even naturally gifted people have to learn the basics and hone that talent. The chances are that you want to be good at whatever you're doing but the learning process is tough on you. Remind yourself that you will get better in time, and that every practice provides a chance for gradual improvement.

, For example, maybe your mom or dad is forcing you to stay with this activity even though you don't want to. If you really don't like it, you may be feeling that all you want to do is quit as soon as possible. This is beside the point. If you really want to stick with something and see it through, you have to make a decision to do so. It is also important to see that this is about you, not about your parents or any other people––by persevering, it is your achievement and success, not anyone else's.

, Do you want to be the best in your group? If there is no way to find out if you're the best in a group, at least try your hardest, which will help you to feel that you've given it your best.


Don't compare yourself to any other people in your group, club, etc. Every person is at a different stage of their own learning and some people take longer to learn and perfect the skills than others.

, In most cases, you'll find that your role models weren't that good when they started but they were determined to get better through trying, practicing and staying focused. Moreover, sometimes it is about making the most of the whole rather than being ""the best"" at something; for example, a lot of people who aren't very good singers are still very popular because they present a complete package which entertains people and brings them joy. Use examples of such people to remind yourself that you can do it.

, Practice never makes perfect but it makes you better! No one can reach their goals without practicing and learning from mistakes or near-enough experiences. Whether you're best or not, it won't always depend on talent but whatever skill you're trying to perfect will always benefit from working hard at it.

, Keep progressing and remind yourself that no one is perfect at any skill without trying and relearning all of the time. Even those at the top of their game, field or expertise need to keep learning and relearning to stay successful and good at what they do.

, As soon as you feel close to being about to quit, include every single thing that you can do to help in one action. For example, practice, watch videos of your role models, etc. all at once. Become absolutely immersed in the activity, look beyond the simpler things you've been taught to discover more things for yourself. In this way, you begin to turn the activity into a part of who you are and your curiosity and thirst for learning more about it than even your teachers can share with you will help to drive you onward.

Identify useful skills.,
Set goals.,
Break down skills into component parts.,
Identify your barriers to learning.,
Focus.,
Network outside of work.",How to Stay Relevant in the Workforce1," You might fear being made obsolete in your industry but not know what skills you should pick up to remain relevant. Research where your industry is headed by reading industry publications and visiting blogs. Also talk to people in your field who are moving up the ranks. Figure out what skills they have that are in demand.


A safe bet is to increase your technological skills. Older workers are seen (fairly or not) as not up-to-date with newer technology. You should do whatever you can to gain technological skills.It’s also generally helpful to learn a new language. If your company is expanding, then they may bring in clients from other countries. Being able to communicate with them will be a huge benefit.;
, Learning is hard. You might become frustrated as you try to master material that is foreign to you. To help you push through, set some goals.For example, you might need to learn how to use Excel. However, you should identify exactly what you want to learn to do with Excel. Be as specific as possible.
If you want to learn French, set a goal of increasing your vocabulary by 100 words each month.

, Every skill is made up of sub-skills.By tackling each sub-skill individually, you’ll build momentum and find the learning process easier.


For example, learning web design includes learning how to hyperlink, include pictures, and write Search Engine Optimization (SEO) content. Become competent in each sub-skill and feel your confidence grow.

, So many things can interfere with learning, e.g., young children, a demanding job, other commitments. To succeed, you’ll need to identify these barriers and come up with creative ways to work around them.


For example, you might be taking a class on writing. You know that your young children at home will impede your ability to do homework at night. Accordingly, you can do your homework during your lunch break.
You might also be able to change your work schedule so that you have one afternoon free. Spend this time doing homework or attending class.

, You’ll make the biggest gains by applying concentrated effort to something.The first few hours of learning a skill are the hardest, but also the most important. Clear away all distractions and give 100% from the very beginning.

, The best way to survive a layoff is to have a well-developed network you can lean on when it comes time to find a new job. Accordingly, you need to network even while employed.


Popular networking spots include conferences, seminars, and Chamber of Commerce events. However, you should consider any place a potential networking event. You can meet people at a soccer game, wedding, or the gym.Identify ahead of time what you hope to get from the networking event. For example, you might simply want to establish an initial contact by exchanging business cards and shaking hands. Or, if you know the people already, you might want to pitch working on a project together.

, There are online universities that offer certificate and degree programs. You can also just take a class that interests you without receiving credit. For example, MIT, Stanford, and Yale have “open courses” online that anyone can take., Community colleges offer a variety of certificates and two-year associate’s degrees. By obtaining one, you can stay on the cutting edge of your current job or prepare for a new one. Often, community colleges work with local industries to fill job shortages.Look in your phone book or online to find the nearest community college. You can find information about applying from the college’s Admissions Office.
You might also want to take only a class or two as a non-degree student. If you like the classes, you can pursue a degree.

, If money is tight, you should look at the following places to see if you can subsidize your coursework:Your employer. They might offer tuition reimbursement for one or two classes. Check with Human Resources.
Federal loans. In the U.S., you’ll need to fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid, called “FAFSA.” Student loans typically have a lower interest rate than personal loans.
Grants. Some schools over grants to students. You’ll need to complete a FAFSA to be eligible.

Choose important assignments.,
Develop a specialty.,
Team up with younger workers.,
Be open to change.,
Focus on quality over quantity.,
Get fit.",How to Stay Relevant in the Workforce3," Avoid doing work that’s easy so that you can slack off. Instead, volunteer for the most difficult (and important) assignments. If you want to be indispensable, you can’t fly under the radar., You want to be the go-to person for certain skills. For example, your department might use a lot of PowerPoint presentations. Become the person most knowledgeable at troubleshooting PowerPoint.


Begin by analyzing your colleagues. What skill do they monopolize? If one of them leaves, you can take over their task.
Also look for new opportunities at work. For example, your business might bring on a new client in a new industry. Volunteer to work on the account. You’ll be one of the few people in your organization with knowledge of the client and industry.

, Instead of becoming territorial, you should welcome the arrival of younger colleagues. Try to get to know them and to work together, if possible.Show them that you are willing to go the extra mile so that they will see that you are irreplaceable.You can learn as much from your younger colleague as they learn from you. For example, they might have the technology skills that are in demand.Try to get your younger colleague to teach you how to use this technology.

, Any employee who resists change will be swept out of the workforce faster than someone who is willing to try something new. Resist the urge to cling to old ways of doing things.Instead, be open and flexible.


Often, people resist change out of fear. However, you’re probably already afraid of becoming less relevant at your job, so you have little to lose.
You might also be afraid of making mistakes. Nevertheless, everyone who tries something new makes errors along the way. Use this as an opportunity to show your boss that you are still open to receiving criticism.

, Don’t confuse doing a task quickly with doing it properly. Always prioritize quality. By working in a thoughtful manner, you can often uncover faster ways of completing tasks, which will help you in the future., You might not think your appearance has anything to do with your job performance, but people will judge you based on how you look. Drop extra weight and buy clothes that fit. You’ll send the message that you’re energetic and not slowing down.You may need to diet to take off pounds. Commit to losing 12 pounds this year—one pound for each month.

Create a LinkedIn profile.,
Write a top-notch resume.,
Tap your network.,
Volunteer in an industry.,
Avoid sitting at home.,
Approach interviews seriously.",How to Stay Relevant in the Workforce4," Almost three quarters of employers use social media in the recruitment process. You’ll fall behind if you don’t create a LinkedIn profile.If you need help, then ask someone to help you.


Make sure you have a professional photo on the website. Don’t pick an old photo that makes you look younger, since any interviewer will be surprised when they meet you.
Look at how other professionals in your industry have set up their profile. Use what looks helpful.
After you create the profile, connect with professionals at businesses where you hope to work.

, If you haven’t searched for a job in a long time, you might not even have a resume. Alternately, you might have thrown something together without really understanding what you were doing. Use the following tips for pulling together an A+ resume:


Keep it short. Your resume shouldn’t be longer than two pages, since employers scan it for roughly 30 seconds.Too much text will confuse them.
Sell yourself. Don’t neutrally explain what you did at each job. Instead, highlight what made you exceptional. For example, you might have driven growth by 200% or improved customer satisfaction by 50%.
Proofread your resume. Have another person look at it so that you catch all typos.

, People generally hire people they know. Ideally, you will know someone at a company before you apply. Go through your email list and try to reestablish contact with former colleagues or former classmates.Tell them you’re looking for a job. Ask for advice.

, You need to get your foot in the door, especially if you’ve never worked in an industry. Volunteering is a great way to begin.You will begin to build relationships through your volunteer work, which can help you if a job becomes available in the industry.


Volunteering is critical if you’ve been laid off. You want to show employers that you’ve used your time off productively.

, No one is going to reach out to you. Instead, you need to put yourself out there and find job opportunities. Research employers thoroughly so you don’t apply to jobs you don’t really want and won’t be hired for.Take job descriptions with a grain of salt. You might think a job is below your current experience level. Nevertheless, the job description might be a general guide, and there could be room for the job to grow.
However, don’t throw resumes far and wide, which isn’t a productive strategy. Identify why you want to work for a business and why you’d be a good fit.

, You might think the employer would be lucky to have you with all of your experience. However, you need to prepare for the interview as if you were fresh out of college. Research the employer on Google and read recent press stories. Find their competitors and read up on the industry generally.Prepare for the interview by doing a mock interview with a friend. If you graduated from college, then your career center might work with alumni. Stop in and do a dry run of your interview. Take all feedback seriously so that you improve your performance.
Don’t over-prepare, however. For example, you shouldn’t prepare canned answers to questions. The key is to be yourself.

Identify other insurance you can offer.,
Offer ways for employees to improve themselves.,
Consider your objectives.,
Ask your employees what they want.,
Obtain quotes.,
Perform a cost-benefit analysis.,
Find cheaper alternatives.,
Present the plan to your employees.",How to Set Up Alternative Benefits Packages," The most common “alternative” benefit packages simply provide employees with a greater menu of options for health and dental insurance or retirement plans. You should take out your current policies and assess whether you want to expand the options available:


For example, you might already offer a defined benefit pension. You could also create a defined contribution plan as an alternative.
Instead of traditional health insurance, you can offer employees health savings accounts. Employees park money in these accounts tax free and withdraw money tax free for eligible reasons. They can also invest the money in stocks or mutual funds.;
, One benefit that won’t cost you anything is to be flexible with an employee’s work schedule. Consider any of the following:Remote work. You can let employees work from home when they don’t need to be in the office. This will help your employees stay engaged, and also show that you trust them.
Compressed work week. Offer an employee the option to work four 10-hour days, or to compress the work week in different ways.
Flexible schedule. If possible, you might let employees set their own hours.

, Other good alternative benefits will encourage your employees to remain physically fit. For example, you might offer the following benefits:Gym discounts. A gym might offer your company a discount for employee memberships.
Sponsored recreational league. Set up a rec league for your employees.
Onsite gym. It might be more affordable to set up your own fitness center for employees to use.

, You can increase the amount of leave that you give employees, which is usually a popular benefit. See if you can offer any of the following:Time off to volunteer. Most people who want to volunteer don’t have the time to. Employees might appreciate paid time off to volunteer in the community.
Vacation or sick time without guilt. Employees may not want to use time off out of fear of getting laid off or because of guilt. Encourage employees to use their time.
Personal days. Some employees feel uncomfortable lying about being sick but don’t want to use vacation time in order to have a day off. You can encourage them to take time off by giving them “personal” days, which can be used for any reason.
Company holidays. Choose a couple non-holidays and call them “holidays.” Close the office and give everyone the day off.Sleep breaks.New parents in particular might welcome a sleep break at the office. Your employees will revive and finish the workday with increased energy.

, Employees might appreciate attempts to make the workplace less stressful and more comfortable. Think about offering any of the following:Encourage employees to bring pets. Letting people bring their dog into work can reduce their stress load.
Let employees dress casual. Although this might not be ideal for employees who deal with the public, you could let back-office employees dress casually.

, You probably are already offering employees health, dental, and possibly vision insurance. However, think about offering the following:


pet insurancecritical-illness insurance
supplemental life insurance
travel insurance

, An employee might be more willing to take a job if they think they can improve their skills and knowledge. Consider offering the following as part of an alternative benefits package:


Tuition assistance. Reimburse your employees for any classes they take at a local college or university.
Professional development. You can encourage employees to stay up on recent developments by hosting seminars or subsidizing employee attendance.
Employee Assistance Program (EAP). You can set up an EAP for employees to contact if they need help dealing with occupational stress, substance abuse, gambling addiction, financial distress, or other issues.

, Alternative benefits can help you compete for talent. However, they can also help you build the business culture that you want. Think about your objectives in offering alternative benefits.


For example, if you want a workplace where people engage more, then you might offer a discount employees can use in your cafeteria.Or you might stock the break room with coffee and pastries in the morning to encourage people to congregate there.
You might also plan a company garden. Give employees time off to work on the garden and let them take the produce home. This is a great way to improve health and let employees recharge emotionally.

, Nobody knows what your employees or potential hires need like they do. Distribute a survey for employees to fill out or ask them in interviews what they want.Remember not to ask employees about their health conditions, which is illegal. Also avoid asking about the employee’s family’s medical history.
To make sure your survey doesn’t break the law, run it by your lawyer first.

, To provide cost-effective benefits, contact different providers and get quotes. You’ll want to compare prices. If necessary, you might need an employee benefits consultant to help you.Alternately, you can outsource to a professional employer organization (PEO). A PEO buys benefits for many companies, so they can get the discounts that a larger company would get., Sit down and check whether or not it makes sense for your company to offer the benefit. For example, you might want to offer discounted gym memberships. You should estimate the number of employees who will select the benefit and multiply that number by the cost.


Now consider whether you can afford to spend that amount. Also consider any savings you might realize if your employees’ health improves and they miss fewer days of work.
Another benefit might be retaining key staff. Employees might leave to work for a competitor who offers an important benefit you don’t.
A cost-benefit analysis is more of an art than a mathematical formula. However, you should have a sense of how important potential benefits are to your employees based on your survey data and interviews.

, Some perks might be out of reach, especially if you are small business with a limited budget. However, you can find alternatives that will still satisfy your employees and accomplish your objectives.


For example, you might not be able to create an on-site cafeteria. However, you could cater a meal once a month for the entire office.Doing so will allow your team to come together and bond.
Also considering paying for a benefit by offering to trade your services. For example, if you run a marketing company, a small restaurant might be willing to host a company meal in exchange for free marketing services.

, Before implementing your alternative benefits package, present the list of potential benefits to your employees and gauge their reaction. Ask for feedback, which will allow you to further adjust the plan if necessary.


Contact providers only after you confirm that employees are enthusiastic about the benefits.
You’ll also need to update your compensation plan to account for the added benefits.
Remember to meet with recipients to answer their questions. They may be confused about details, so let them ask questions. Clarify how the benefit will work."

Think of something totally different to do.,
Tell the necessary people about your fun activity.,
Speak to people who you know are often calm or who seem very organised.,
Try out some relaxation techniques.,
Stop pretending everything is OK. Maybe speaking to another busy friend from work would help and you could find something fun and calming to do together.

,
Remind yourself that you will not always feel this way and everything comes to an end.,
Be observant of other people's behaviour and physical appearance.",How to Stop and Take Time Out," Clues are often other people mentioning that you seem tired or upset. You may notice that you have lost your temper quite a lot recently or that you have 'not been with it' today.;
, Common areas of tension are shoulders, back and neck but by stopping and thinking about how your body feels you will learn about how your body is coping.

, If you have kids it may not be practical to go for a long walk right now but build it in to tomorrow's schedule or even for the weekend. The action of planning what to do may help to relieve the tension. Exercise is a very good way of de-stressing and team sports or a game of tennis will help you to have a target for your stress.

, A new hobby to take up, a place you've never been to before (even if its the local art gallery), speaking to a friend from 10 years ago. A new activity will help to take you out of the auto-pilot routine and may give you a new energy for life.

, It may be a family picnic so make sure everyone is free. If it something you want to do alone hire a babysitter for the kids or tell your parents where you are going and that you need a break. Put yourself in their shoes - they are watching you in auto-pilot and want to know that you are taking steps to feel better.

, We can learn so much from other people if we just ask and a lot of the time they may be able to give you very simple tips to apply.

, Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is often successful for noticing which parts of your body really need to relax and you can teach yourself how to do this. Another very simple technique is to lie face down on the floor and see how you feel - being at your lowest physically can give you the drive to know you need a break.

,, Once you have learnt how to recognise that you need a break it will get easier every time.

, If they look stressed or over-worked politely suggest that they take a break or plan something to do with them or for them, like going to the cinema or sharing their work-load. The action of helping others will help you even more to recognise and act on your own stress.

Decide how you want to respond.,
Discuss the situation.,
End inappropriate communication.,
Say that you are not interested in a relationship.",How to Respond when an Intern Has Feelings for You1," The feelings the intern has may be flattering, threatening, or mutual. It’s up to you to determine how to respond based on how you feel. If you enjoy the attention or it’s completely harmless, let it go. Some people enjoy playful flirting in the workplace as long as it does not affect job performance. You may want to address the feelings or advances, let them be, or get someone else involved.


Consider the appropriateness of an intern/supervisor romantic relationship in the context of professional ethics and company policies.
Be careful how other people perceive your flirting. Other interns or co-workers may begin to question whether something is going on and if they themselves are being treated fairly.;
, How you handle the intern’s feelings is up to you. You may want to meet with intern and let them know privately that their actions are not professional. If that feels too confrontational or serious, respond back to comments in the moment to show that you’d rather not cross that line. Find a way to communicate clearly that you’d rather not interact in this way.


You can say, “While I’m flattered, it would be best if you toned down your affections toward me.”
For a more casual approach, say, “Let's stop with the advances, alright? I don’t need any gossip following me here.”

, If the intern makes inappropriate comments, sends inappropriate emails, or communicates nonverbally in a way that is not appropriate for the workplace, put a stop to it.Communicate your desire for the actions to stop. For example, if the intern is staring at you, say, “Is there something you need?”


If comments seem to catch you off guard or shock you, have some responses in the ready. Say, “That’s inappropriate,” or “I’m not comfortable with you saying that.”, If the person makes advances to you, don’t hesitant to state your feelings directly.Especially if the comments or advances make you uncomfortable, be direct and honest. Say, “This is inappropriate and I am not interested in pursuing any romantic involvement with you.”


Clearly communicate that you wish for the advances to stop and that feelings are in no way mutual.

"
Steer conversations to work.,
Avoid spending private time together.,
Have meetings in public locations.,
Decline after hours events together.",How to Respond when an Intern Has Feelings for You2," You may feel like the person asks about your personal life or wants to know more about you than you’d like to share. Make a clear boundary by saying, “I’d rather not discuss that.” Follow it up by bringing up a work topic to bring the conversation back to work-related topics.This can help redirect the comment while also showing that you’re being clear in your boundaries and it’s important to respect them.


Say, “That’s not appropriate for work. However, I do want to hear how your meeting went with our suppliers. Please fill me in.”

, If you are working on a project together, make sure that another person is with you while you work. If the other person leaves, say, “Well, I better get back to my other work now.” Involve other people if there’s ever a chance you may work independently together. You can say, “I think Ashlee could contribute well here. Let me ask her if she can help.”


Keep all professional time together professional and make it clear you want nothing beyond a professional relationship with the intern.

, If you must meet individually, meet in a public place such as a meeting room. If you meet in a private office, keep the door open or have a third party present.Keep any contact between you as strictly professional.


Safeguard yourself from any potential problems from the intern or other workers.

, The intern may invite you to join them after work for drinks or dinner, or to get coffee during the day. Spending time with you outside of work may be a way for the intern to develop a personal relationship with you. Decline these offers to avoid any confusion or mixed messages.


You can say to the intern, “I’d like to keep our relationship professional and not personal.”

"
"
Consider transferring them to a different supervisor.,
Take harassment seriously.,
Report any unwanted attention.",How to Respond when an Intern Has Feelings for You3," If the intern works directly under you, you may want to have the person reassigned. The behaviors may bother you or cause you problems in your own tasks. If the person is contacting you for all reasons and all hours of the day, you may suggest that you do not work well together and find their behavior distracting.When making changes, you do not need to mention any feelings. Just make it a work matter that you do not work well together.

, If you feel harassed by the intern, don’t let it slide or continue to put up with it. If you feel the attention is unwanted and uncomfortable, speak up.Go to HR and talk about the harassment you’re experiencing. Ask about what steps to take next.
Keep in mind that the tables can be turned and the intern can report you for sexual harassment whether you respond to their advances or not.

, If the advances make you feel uncomfortable and/or are inappropriate in a workspace, make a report to human resources. Talk to the intern that you feel uncomfortable, the advances are not wanted, and you will take necessary action if they do not stop.Take to human resources on how to handle the situation. They may have some advice for you on how to handle it, who else to talk to, or how to reassign the intern.
You can also file a police report, if necessary.

Recognize the dangers of workplace romance.,
Avoid keeping a secret relationship.,
Discuss job reassignment.",How to Respond when an Intern Has Feelings for You4," Often, workplaces do not allow romances between bosses and subordinates.Even if feelings are mutual, things can go very wrong in a workplace romance, especially if there’s a difference of power or position between you. The potential for a sexual harassment accusation can loom for each of you, especially if one of you moves up in the company.A romantic relationship could be interpreted by outsiders as the supervisor taking advantage of their position of power over the intern.
An intern may use the relationship for their own advancement or against the supervisor in the future. The supervisor will be perceived as the authority figure in the relationship and may take the blame if sexual harassment or ethical violation is dealt with in an official manner.
If things do not work well between the two of you, then you have to see the person every day at work. In some situations, you may want to or need to change jobs.

, Many office couples choose to connect in secret, at least at first. However, the secret almost always gets out and the privacy of the relationship fails.Especially if your workplace mandates reporting relationships within the office, it’s best to come out with it or to not pursue it at all.


You may want to keep a romance private at first to protect yourselves or to keep things between the two of you. However, be careful how far you take the relationship in this secrecy.

, If you are attracted to the intern and want to pursue a relationship, it’s likely that one of you will need to exit the company. If you can wait, you may wait until the internship is over. However, if you want to date now, your company may not allow it, which may lead to one of you leaving the company.You may need to discuss work contracts and assess when the relationship could begin. In the meantime, do not act on your relationship while working together.

Determine the details to make sure you don't flip-flop.,
Give two weeks notice to leave on a good note.,
Ask for time off to attend to personal matters.,
Plan to stay till your last day.,
Write a signed letter of resignation.,
Request a meeting with your manager and/or human resources.",How to Resign Elegantly1," Before you announce your resignation to anyone you must have your plans in order. The last thing you want to do is give false or changing information throughout the process of leaving.


If you don’t have all your details in order, you can make it harder for your employer to hire a replacement and plan for your departure.
A situation such as this may lead to ending your employment on bad terms with a bad reference and/or a disbelief that you are actually leaving with a chance of being asked to leave.
Be absolutely sure you are resigning. Whether you have another job or are leaving for other reasons, it is important to stick to the plan once you have made an announcement.;
, Know your exact last day and follow the two weeks or more notice rule. It is most important for your current and future employer (if there is one) to have a solid date of when you are leaving your current job.


For most companies and positions, a 2 week notice is standard and acceptable.
However, your company may require more time due to job specific circumstances.
For example, if you are the only one in the IT department, you most likely will be asked to stay longer than 2 weeks to allow the employer to find a replacement.

, If you need to attend to personal matters, make sure you give your employer dates or times you may need to take care of personal matters prior to your resignation.


For example, if you are moving out of state or resigning due to an illness, your employer may be flexible in giving you some time off to take care of personal matters.

, Once you have announced your resignation, it may be hard to stay as long as you have agreed to. This can be for many reasons, including being over your current job or being anxious to start a new one.


If you leave your current job prior to the time you agreed to stay, it will most likely be considered insubordination.
This will render you ineligible for rehire and can present a bad reference issue in the future.

, A letter of resignation is generally very brief and to the point. In your letter of resignation, include the following:


A formal salutation to your supervisor and/or others notified. For example, “Dear Ms. Smith”.
A statement that expresses you are leaving the company. For example, “This letter is to inform you that I am leaving my position as Project Manager”.
Your last date of employment. For example, “…as of September 5, 2014”.
A thank you to the employer for the opportunity to work for/with them. For example, “Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to develop my knowledge, skills and abilities within the industry.”
A sincere closing such as “Many Thanks” or “Sincerely”.
Your signature and printed name.

, First, know who you must notify. Most likely, it will just be your direct supervisor.


However, some circumstances may require a member of HR to be present as well.
For example, if you are leaving due to a conflict with your supervisor or an issue known by HR. Once you know who must be in that meeting, request their time.
It is best to hold this meeting face to face if you are in the same office or your location is close.
A phone call will do if you are not in close proximity.
For example, if you would have to drive over 4 hours or fly to speak to your supervisor.
When requesting a meeting, you do not need to say why. All you have to say is, “Can I have a little of your time today to discuss something?”

"
"
Thank them for taking the time to meet with you.,
Break the news.,
Thank them for the opportunity to learn and grow with the company.,
Offer your assistance to find and/or train your replacement to ease the transition.,
Request a letter of recommendation.,
Ask questions about next steps.,
Submit your signed resignation letter.,
Refrain from lying.,
Don't list all the negatives about your work.,
Be modest to avoid sounding arrogant.,
Remain courteous.",How to Resign Elegantly2," Since the meeting was by your request, you should be the one to control it. To set a good tone, you should thank the members for taking time out of their day to speak with you.


For example, “I understand you are very busy today, so thank you for taking the time to meet with me”.

, Simply explain that you have decided to leave the company. Although it is not required, you can choose to provide a brief explanation as long as it will not create a negative situation.


For example you can say, “I have decided to leave the company to pursue another opportunity” or “I have chosen to leave the company for personal reasons”.
Then, give your last date of employment. As described above, you can provide the standard 2 week notice unless you are required to provide a longer notice.

, Many jobs provide the employee with valuable knowledge and experience that will most likely contribute to their next career move.


It is important to recognize this and convey your gratitude. If you do so, you will leave a good lasting impression.

, If you are leaving on good terms and want to help the company or your replacement, you can offer your assistance.


Offering your assistance in hiring or training your replacement takes a load off of others who may not understand everything you do in a day.
Your employer may not take you up on your offer but the offer itself shows that you are courteous and loyal to the company.

, If you are leaving on good terms, it may be beneficial to ask for a letter of recommendation. This is a good idea even if you do not need the letter at this time.


You never know how many references a future employer will request.
Therefore, it is best to request a letter of recommendation while your work is still fresh in your supervisor’s mind.

, Each company has their own procedures when someone resigns. If during the meeting these procedures are not explained to you, you should ask.


For example, “So what are the next steps?” or “Are there any special procedures I need to follow from now until my last day?” Some important information to obtain includes:

If there will be an exit interview. An exit interview allows an employee who is leaving to provide the company with constructive criticism and other feedback.
What the procedure is to return company property (phone, car, laptop, tablet, etc.).
What paperwork, if any, is needed to be signed.



, Nearing the completion of the meeting, hand over a signed resignation letter. The letter must include the details described above, which you should have also verbally expressed. This letter will be kept in your personnel file.

, You must remain truthful throughout your resignation process. If you do not want to disclose too much information, it is best to provide vague information or not say anything at all.


For example, if you do not want to explain that you are resigning because you do not believe the company is ethical, you can just say you are leaving for personal reasons.
Being vague is better than lying about having to take care of a family member.

, It is best to keep the meeting as positive as possible and not provide your employer with numerous negative reasons for your departure. If in fact you are leaving because of an issue, it is OK to express that.


However, it is one thing to state it and another to go on and on with a list of negatives that contributed to you leaving.

, Don't gloat over your new position or life choice. If you are excited about the next steps in your life or professional career, it is natural to want to discuss with others.


However, during your meeting and before your last day, it is important to keep your expression of these feelings low key.
If you constantly talk about it, you may produce negative feelings surrounding your departure, such as resentment or anger.

, No matter what the circumstances are, it is imperative to remain as courteous and respectful as possible, from the time you have decided to resign through your last day on the job. You never know who knows who or when you will need to interact with these people again.


For your career and reputation, it cannot be stressed enough how important it is to remain professional, even when it is very tough to do so.

Write down a list of reasons why you cannot complete the request.,
Analyse your work priorities.,
Put yourself in your boss's shoes.,
Consider what language to use.,
Find a convenient time for your boss.,
Be concise.,
Explain yourself.,
Don't leave it too long.,
Suggest reorganizing your priorities.,
Recommend a colleague.,
Propose new work arrangements.",How to Say No To Your Boss," If your boss has asked you to take on some extra work or complete a task that either you don't have time for, or is beyond your job description, it can be helpful to write down a list of reasons why you have to say no to the task. Calmly and rationally brainstorm the problem and organise these notes. They will help you prepare your response to your boss.


There may be simple reasons why you cannot do a task, such as childcare commitments or booked holiday time.
If you are uncertain if the task is appropriate for you, check it against your job description.If you already have a heavy workload and cannot take on any more, you need to think carefully about how to approach this.;
, If your work schedule is the problem and you simply don't believe you can take on the extra tasks, take some time to fully analyse your priorities. Weigh the new task up against the others and evaluate whether you can shift around your existing work. Just saying ""I don't have time"" could potentially lead to your boss questioning your effectiveness and efficiency, so if time is the problem you need to demonstrate that you can prioritise tasks and complete them in a timely way.Draw up a list of your tasks and order them by priority and deadline.
Sketch out how long each one is likely to take, and determine whether there is any chance that you could complete the new task as well.
Make a neat and clear document which you can use when you talk to your boss.
This is a way of ""showing"" your boss that you can't do what they ask, rather than ""telling""., Before you approach your boss it's important that you take the time to put yourself in her shoes and understand her and the company's priorities. Understanding her motivations will help you better formulate your response. If you not doing a certain task is likely to cost the company significant income then you will need a very persuasive argument and an alternative that means the company does not lose this revenue.


If you only want to reschedule a meeting due to a prior commitment, think about how this rescheduling will impact on your boss.Taking time to put yourself in her shoes will help you anticipate how she will respond to you.

, It's crucial that you get the tone and language right in order to say no without saying no. Remember that it is essential that you use neutral language at all times and avoid personalising the situation. This means don't make it about you or your boss, or the relationship you have, whether it is good or bad. Always refer to the company and how to reach the best outcome for the business.Say something neutral and objective like, ""If I were to complete this task, then I wouldn't have time to finish the main report this week"".
Avoid subjective and personal responses. Don't say ""I can't do this, it's too much for me"".

, Before you approach your boss to talk you should determine a convenient time for her. You definitely don't want to catch her at a stressed or busy moment. You will probably have a good idea of her working patterns, but check her diary on your computer if possible. Depending on the culture and work practices in your office you should ask if she has a few minutes to spare as you want to discuss something.


Have the conversation in private if your work situation allows you to get a moment alone with your boss.
Keep in mind her workday pressures and work style. If she is a morning person try to speak with her before lunch.
If you know she is always first to arrive you could come in early one morning to catch her before the others arrive.

, When you do talk to your boss it's important that you get to the point quickly and don't skirt around the issue. You need to make sure that you are saying exactly what you mean in a clear and concise way. Don't spend too long dancing around it as your boss will think you are wasting her time and will lose sympathy for you.


Avoid saying ""yes, but..."" as your boss may just here the ""yes"" and think that you could do this task, if you were more organized.Instead of using negative words like ""but"", try to use more positive ones.
For example, instead of saying ""I know you asked me to do this report, but I have too much other work"", try something like ""I have an idea about how to reorganize the workload on this project""., It is absolutely crucial that you explain your reasoning clearly and effectively. If you can't make a solid argument then your boss is not likely to understand why you can't complete the task. For example, if you have been asked to do something that is well outside your job description you should make this clear and be prepared to refer to your job description if necessary. Don't walk in waving the job description, but be prepared to refer to it.


If time is the problem, you need tangible and indisputable reasons why you can't do the task you have been assigned.
Refer to other work you are doing that has priority. Say something like, ""I have a deadline for the Spring report next week, so this other task would take me away from that"".Try to emphasise how your boss reassigning the task to someone else will benefit her and the company by highlighting the work you will be doing that is more important.Explain yourself firmly and directly, but never in a confrontational or emotional way.

, If you know quickly that you will not be able to complete a certain task, or that is inappropriate for you, don't wait long before you schedule a conversation with your boss. If you leave it, it will only make it harder to re-organize the work and still get it done in a timely fashion. If you wait until the last minute, it could be almost impossible for the deadline to be met. This will not endear you to your boss., When you talk to your boss it is important that you do not flat out say ""no"" if you can possibly avoid it. Rather try to find a way of offering a positive alternative that still amounts to you not doing the task you feel you are unable to complete. One good way to do this is to suggest your boss helps you reorganise your priorities. By doing this you'll be showing your boss that you are seeking to be as productive as possible, but you will also make it clear that your workload as it stands is not sustainable.


Take a record of your outstanding work and how long it will take you complete each task to evidence that you have thought about it closely.
Asking your boss ""can you help me reorganise my priorities?"" will demonstrate that you want to involve them in how you manage your work.
This will show you respect her opinion and are seeking some guidance about how to work more efficiently., Another way to suggest a positive alternative rather than just saying no, is to recommend a colleague who could pick up the extra work. Doing this will demonstrate that you have thought about the task and who is best suited to it.Your boss will be impressed that you have thought about her and the company's need to get the job done rather than just your own concerns about being overworked.


Demonstrating that you have good judgement and have prioritized the needs to company will make it more likely that she trusts your judgement more readily in the future.You will also demonstrate that you understand what is happening throughout the office and are interested in the development of your colleagues.

, If you are being given too much work to complete in the hours you are contracted to work, this could be an opportunity to approach your boss about establishing a new working arrangement. For example, if you have a long commute that is eating into your productivity you might suggest working from home one day a week which will cut down on your commuting time.If you think a more flexible working pattern would enable you to adapt to different demands at work, don't be afraid to bring this up.
Always think about the culture of your workplace and whether more flexible working is a feasible idea.
Clearly think through any proposal before you make it. Don't go in with an idea that you have not fully fleshed out.

Let everyone know you're leaving ahead of time.,
Say your goodbyes ahead of time.,
Meet with people one-on-one.,
Network with people before you leave.,
Keep it brief.,
Maintain a positive attitude.,
Invite close work friends to a more personal event after work.",How to Say Goodbye to Coworkers1," Your last day usually isn't the best time to let everyone know that you're not coming back. It can seem hasty or rude to have one foot out the door and shout a ""so long"" before it closes. Take the time to let everyone know your plans and your schedule for leaving, so everyone can be on the same page.


A general rule of thumb is that the management needs at least two weeks notice ahead of time, though more specific time-tables for leaving may be built into your contract. Make sure that your bosses are the first to know.
After letting management know, it's ok to tell your coworkers. Do so whenever you feel comfortable, or whenever it's convenient, but do it before your last day.;
, Consider saying goodbye on your second to last day so that your last day can be less stressful and packed, especially if you've still got work to do. Waiting until the day before you leave will also give you the chance to finish up all of your projects without your coworkers flooding in to say goodbye.Once you have announced that you are leaving, chances are that your coworkers will come trickling in to say goodbye. Because of this, saying goodbye can be made easier if you are done with all of your tasks.

, Get your stuff packed up early so that you can take the time to say goodbye to your coworkers individually. Doing this can give you both a sense of closure because this will be the last time that you meet together as coworkers.


However, keep in mind that unless you are moving, you will be able to see your coworkers outside of work if you really want to. Consider organizing a small event for your close coworkers outside of the office environment.
If your coworker is leaving and you're staying, it might also be a good idea to get together a small group of coworkers to all go drop by and say goodbye at once. This can make it a lot easier on your coworker, by taking the first step.

, Try to connect with as many coworkers as you can before you leave the office, either through social media platforms or with email. Connect with people that you actually have an interest in staying in touch with, but don't feel like you have to friend everyone on Facebook to make it easier.


In the weeks before your departure, consider beginning to connect with coworkers on business platforms like LinkedIn, if you have not already. This can be an excellent way to feel like you've still got professional contacts and references at the ready, if you should need them in the future.

, If you're in a professional environment, treat it professionally. There's no need for a big display or procedure. Tell your coworker that it's been nice working together, wish them luck, and tell them to get in touch sometime. It doesn't need to be any more complicated than that.


If your coworker is leaving and you're staying, try to remember that they've got a lot of people to talk to, and might not want to have a 45 minute long debrief with every single person. Even if you're sad to see them go, keep it quiet and make plans later if necessary.
It would be perfectly fine to say something like, ""Mark! It's been good working together. Keep things locked down around here. You're a good guy. Let me know how you're doing, ok?""

, If you have been asked to leave, or are leaving in frustration, it may be challenging to keep your composure when you're saying goodbye to your coworkers. However, you should try to remain calm in order to present yourself in the most professional light. Stay positive and brief, even if you're feeling frustrated. You'll be glad you did.

, Workplaces can be a mixed bag: you might have some real friends that you hope to stay in touch with, some downright enemies that you can't stand, and a whole bunch of people somewhere in the middle. There's no sense in having a big party with everyone if the occasion doesn't call for it.


On the down low, invite a few of your close friends to after-work drinks or dinner to decompress after the day and talk more openly. This can be an excellent way of spending a bit of time with the people your'e legitimately interested in keeping in touch with outside of work.

Consider changing your visa status if your current visa cannot be extended.,
Talk about an extension with your employer.,
Make sure you have your Form I-94.,
Hire a translator if necessary.",How to Renew a Work Permit1," There are two basic types of work permit: work visas and employment authorization documents (EADs).


Work Visas – Work visas are acquired with the assistance of a U.S. employer who wants to temporarily bring an immigrant to the United States for work. If you hold a work visa, your I-94 Arrival-Departure Record is proof of your right to work

Spouse of an H-1, L-1, or E1/2/3 visa holder.
Asylees
Refugees
Domestic servants

;
, You are not allowed to apply for a new EAD more than 120 days before the current one expires, but you should be sure to apply at least 45 days in advance of expiration. You should also apply for a renewed work visa at least 45 days in advance, and preferably sooner. Check your visa to see when it expires. You can find information on all the visas at the site of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Here are some of the more common work visas and their expiration dates:


H-1B – Specialty Occupations and Fashion Models – Up to 3 years, with a 3 year extension possible.

See the Form I-129 Instructions to see if you are eligible to change visa status.

, An application for extension of a work visa will usually need to be made by your employer. You should talk to them at least four months before your current visa expires about an extension.

, The employer will take care of most of the paperwork, but the employee will need to provide his or her Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, with the admission number (aka Departure Number) and the date of expiration of his or her stay.If the employee was issued an electronic Form I-94, he or she may obtain a paper version for free at the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) website.
If the employee has lost his or her Form I-94, he or she can obtain a free replacement at the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) website by filing Form I-102. Form I-102 may be filed alongside the application for extension (Form I-129).

, All foreign language documents submitted to USCIS must be accompanied by an English translation certified to be complete and accurate by the translator."

I would love to stay in contact and can be reached at (your email) or on my LinkedIn profile. Cheers to the great times we have had working together. Sincerely, (Your Name).

, You might be tempted to openly write about the bitter times, particularly if you were fired. However, it is advised that you keep a positive tone in order to present yourself in the best possible light. Being positive will also make it more likely that you will be able to network with your coworkers in the future.


It is always wise to end on a happy note so try to be as positive about your experience at the company as possible. This is especially important if you are sending this email to your boss.

, It should not be a long essay, but a few sentences. There is no need to disclose the actual reason for your leaving at length. If people have questions, you might encourage them to contact you directly or in person. Only mention that you are moving forward and have decided to try your hand at another career.

, Your goodbye email can end with your contact details. Clearly mention your mobile number, email address and Linkedin ID through which you can keep in contact with your coworkers.However, do not share your personal contact information if you are not comfortable doing so.


You could also consider selecting only a few coworkers to share your information with. An email can be an easy way of getting everyone on the same thread and sharing info together, to make sure you'll all be able to get together in the future.

, Once you have finalized your draft, read through it to make sure that it is free of errors and is grammatically correct. You should also check to make sure that your tone comes across as friendly and positive, while also being professional.


Make sure that you have included everyone that you want to in your email.
Consider reading your email out loud to see if any part sounds awkward.

, It's usually a little cold to email your close work friends to let them know that you're leaving. Unless it's not possible, try to say goodbye to them in person. You need to let your superiors know in person, or at least over the phone, in most cases.


If you are unable to meet with your closest coworkers one-on-one for some reason, you should send out personal emails telling them how much you have enjoyed working with them. Make sure that you give them your personal contact information so that you can stay in touch outside of the office.
An example personal email may include something like: Dear (Coworker’s name): As you have probably heard, I am going to be leaving this company soon. I have enjoyed working with you so much and will miss your positive energy. I would love to stay in touch and hope that we can hang out outside of the office. You can reach me on my phone (number) or at (your email). Cheers to the time that we got to spend working together! Sincerely, (Your Name).

Don't make false promises.,
Don't use your last day to tell off your boss.,
Don't bring gifts.,
Don't denigrate the company to your coworkers.,
Don't just leave without saying anything.",How to Say Goodbye to Coworkers3," If you have no intention or desire to stay in touch with Dennis from accounting, don't layer on the false promises of ""Getting together for a drink sometime."" Aside from the fact that you might actually have to follow up on something you don't want to do, it has the tendency to seem disingenuous and fake. Just be sincere and honest, and don't feel any pressure to make plans with people you don't have any desire to make plans with.


If you feel rude making plans with some people and not others, just keep your plans quiet. No need in letting everyone know you're going to be getting together with one person on a regular basis to watch football if that'll offend some of your other coworkers.

, No epic walk-out shouting. No profanity-laden tirades. Your last day should be quiet, dignified, and brief. Even if you feel like you've been wronged in some way, it's usually a bad idea to engage in any kind of shouting match with your boss, who might have power in keeping you from getting your next job. Be a professional, even if you don't feel like it.


If you've got a legitimate beef that you need settled in words, do it in person, one-on-one, and keep it as professional as possible. Tell your boss (or whoever it is that you've got a problem with) that you'd like a word in private to talk about some things.
At some workplaces, it's common to do an exit interview, in which you'll be able to voice your frustrations free of having to worry about how it will affect your job. You're already leaving, so there's no sense in speaking softly now.

, It's not important to shower your coworkers with gifts, and it can have the effect of making some of your coworkers uncomfortable. It's unnecessary and can seem ostentatious. Again, it's a professional environment, so act like it.


If you really feel the need to bring something, a box of pastries or donuts for the floor would be a perfectly fine way of giving a little something nice back, but don't feel like you need to pass around a bunch of iPods to say goodbye. There's no need.
If your coworker is leaving and you want to wish them luck, a card would be a perfectly friendly way of doing so. Again, no need for gold watches.

, If you're leaving, don't use it as an opportunity to dump all your disappointments and frustrations at the feet of the employees who'll have to sweep them up after you leave. try to leave on a positive note and don't make it awkward for everyone who has to stay.


Likewise, it's a bad idea to brag about how much better your new job is going to be if you're leaving for greener pastures. try to remember that your coworkers still have to come back in on Monday, and you don't want to leave a toxic work environment in your wake.

, The mystery will probably create a bad impression and leave behind a lot of suspicion for your other coworkers that might not be good for everyone. If you're feeling awkward about leaving, it's something you still need to get over and make personal for everyone. Again, it doesn't need to be a big deal: just keep it short and sweet and get out the door. You'll be done soon.

Participate in an investigation.,
Think twice before agreeing to mediation.,
Choose an office to report to.,
File a discrimination or retaliation charge with the EEOC.,
Write a letter.,
File the charge with a FEPA instead.",How to Report Discrimination in the Workplace," Federal law prohibits discrimination at work on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (if 40 or older), disability, or genetic information.Federal law applies to employers with at least 15 employees; for age discrimination, the employer must have at least 20 employees.Federal law may also protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, though the law is in flux.
It is also against the law to harass anyone based upon one of these protected characteristics. Teasing or minor isolated incidents are not prohibited. However, if the harassment is so frequent that the work environment becomes hostile, then it is illegal.The federal government’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has been created to investigate charges of discrimination in the workplace.;
, Many states and municipalities also have their own anti-discrimination laws.These laws can apply to employers not covered by the federal law. They also can protect more people than the federal law. For example, many state and municipalities prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.


To find your state law, you can search the Internet. Type “anti-discrimination” and your state or city into a web browser. If you can’t find anything, then visit your local law library.
States also have their own administrative agencies tasked with investigating charges of discrimination. These are called Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPA)., If you report discrimination, then it is also illegal for your employer to retaliate against you. Retaliation includes firing, demotion, harassment, or any other form of retaliation because you filed a discrimination charge or otherwise complained about the discrimination.Retaliation is prohibited in a variety of areas. For example, you cannot be retaliated against in hiring, firing, work assignments, pay, benefits, training, or other conditions of employment.
You also do not need to be the victim of the discrimination to suffer retaliation. For example, you may report that your employer practices race discrimination against African Americans even though you are Latino. It is nevertheless illegal for your employer to retaliate against you for complaining about the discrimination.

, To determine your first steps, you need to find your employment contract and check if there is a grievance procedure that you should follow. Many employers outline a process you should follow when complaining about harassment or discrimination. If you don’t have a copy of your contract, then ask Human Resources (HR) for a copy.


You can also look in any employee handbooks or manuals that you have received. These sometimes outline the company’s grievance procedure.
If you belong to a union, then you should also look at your collective bargaining agreement. These sometimes contain special procedures for union members to follow.

, You should gather as much evidence of discrimination that you can so that you can share it with the appropriate authorities. Try to document the harassment or discrimination as best you can. You should also document the effects of the discrimination, such as mental or physical ailments.


Preserve communications. You should save any emails, memos, letters, evaluations, or voice mails that you believe illustrate the discrimination or were motivated by discrimination.
Take down witness names.If someone else at work observed the discriminatory conduct, then you should write down their names and contact information.
Write down your own memories. In order to preserve face-to-face communications, you should sit down and document the incident as you remember it. Try to write down what you remember while it is fresh in your memory. Summarize what was said or done and who witnessed the incident.
Keep medical or mental health records. These can show the impact the discrimination had on you. For example, the increased stress could have resulted in high blood pressure., Reporting discrimination to your employer can immediately put a target on your back, especially if you are complaining about a supervisor or someone else in management. Accordingly, you need to give some thought as to how to handle reporting the discrimination. An experienced employment attorney can be a great asset.


At your consultation with the lawyer, you could discuss the problems you are having and consider the advantages or disadvantages of complaining.
You are not required to have a lawyer either to file an internal grievance or to file a discrimination charge with the EEOC. However, you should schedule a meeting if you need advice and don’t know what to do.
For tips on how to find a qualified employment lawyer, see Find an Employment Lawyer.

, Some employers require that you meet informally with your supervisor to discuss a grievance. You will meet before you fill out any paperwork. Even if you are not required to meet with a supervisor, it might be a good idea to meet nonetheless.


If the supervisor is the source of the problem, then you can go directly to Human Resources to pursue the grievance. Call and tell the person on the other end of the phone.

, If you were unhappy with the resolution offered by your supervisor, then you should contact Human Resources and request a grievance form to fill out. Provide all necessary information as well as copies of your supporting documentation.


Only provide copies. Originals can get lost.

, After you complete the grievance form, you should have a meeting with someone from HR or management to discuss the discrimination. Share copies of any documentation that you have.


Pay attention to how attentive HR or management is to your complaint. If you think that the company is not interested in rooting out discrimination or harassment, then you should proceed to filing a charge with the EEOC.

, Your employer should investigate the allegation of discrimination. A typical investigation includes interviewing witnesses, reviewing documents and data, and then issuing a written report.You should make yourself available to meet with the investigator and provide any information willingly.


At the resolution of the investigation, you should be provided with the results in writing. You may also be told what next steps you can take internally with the company.

, In order to make a discrimination charge disappear, your employer might offer mediation. In mediation, you and someone from the company will meet with a neutral third party (the mediator) to discuss possible solutions.


There is definitely a time and place for mediation. It is in your best interest, however, to delay mediation until you file a charge with the EEOC. If you resolve your dispute before filing a charge, then you will lose the right to sue your employer at a later date. Filing a charge is a prerequisite to filing a discrimination lawsuit in court., If your discrimination charge is covered by both state and federal law, then you can choose to file either with the federal government’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the state FEPA.


Where the discrimination is prohibited by both federal and state law, then a charge filed with one office will be shared with the other office.Accordingly, if you file with the EEOC, then the charge will be shared with your state FEPA.
You shouldn’t wait to file. Federal employees only have 45 days from the date of the discriminatory action to contact an EEOC counselor. All others have at least 180 days to file a charge. If your state has a law that prohibits the same discriminatory conduct, then you might have up to 300 days.In any event, you should not wait too long.

, There are essentially two ways to file: in person or through the mail. If you want to file in person, then visit any of the EEOC’s 53 field offices. A map at the EEOC website shows the location of its field offices. You should call ahead of time to check if you need to schedule an appointment or if the office accepts walk-ins.

, You may also file a charge by mailing a letter to the EEOC. If no field office is near you, then this might be the best option. Make sure that your letter contains the following information:your name, address, and telephone number
your employer’s name, address, and telephone number
the number of employees employed there
a short description of the events you believe were discriminatory
when the events took place
that illegal discrimination was the motivation for the discriminatory events
your signature

, If there is a FEPA in your state, then you have the option of filing with it. The process varies by state. In Maryland, for example, you can file a complaint with the state’s Commission on Civil Rights. There are 3 ways to file:In person. You can visit the William Donald Schaefer Tower at 6 Saint Paul Street in Baltimore to file a complaint. Office hours for walk-ins are Mondays and Fridays 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. On other weekdays, you can meet by appointment only. You can call 1-800-637-6347 to start the complaint process.
By letter. You can write a letter containing all of the information that a letter to the EEOC would contain. You can then mail the letter or email it.

Mail the letter to Maryland Commission on Civil Rights, ATTN: Intake, William Donald Schaefer Tower, 6 Saint Paul Street, 9th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21202-1631.
Email the letter to mccr@maryland.gov.

Focus on your leadership ability, first and foremost.,
Target every group within your business regarding your campaign for change, explaining to each group why change is necessary.,
Communicate with everyone who has been affected once the change occurs.,
Realize that no matter how much effort you invest into making the transition seamless, you will experience at least some resistance.,
Understand that there is no way of predicting how long it will take to fully implement a change.",How to Improve Your Change Management Skills," Solid leadership skills are much more important during a transition rather than strict business procedures. Being a good leader will get people to believe and trust in what you're doing, which in turn will allow you to begin your campaign for change. To be an effective leader in the change management process, you should:


Set an example. As head of your business, others turn to you for direction in business needs, behavior, ethics, and standards. If others in your business are to change, you need to set an example.
Remove perks. Perks suggest division and thought processes typical in a hierarchy. Removing your perks shows that you're willing to level the playing field.
Walk around and talk to people. Today's business leaders manage their employees better through face-to-face interactions and learning more about their problems on an individual basis.

Be genuine. To be a leader of change, it is critical to be honest in your interactions with other people. You don't have to open yourself up like a book, but being a leader also doesn't mean you need to hide your emotions. Just let people get to know you. Doing so allows you to build trust and rapport.
Have passion. Being a strong leader requires passion behind your vision for change. Without passion, you will face frustration and lose the desire to continue forward. Leadership requires lots of energy, so make sure you are passionate about what you are doing.;
, For example, the board of directors may be curious about the long-term effects of the change. Or, your employees may want to know how they will personally be affected by your proposed changes.

, Fill your employees in on what is happening. It may help to set up a formal way of communicating with everyone. By keeping everyone informed, you reduce the chances of low productivity and low morale.

, The reason for this is that some people adjust to change at different rates. To reduce your frustration, it is helpful to know the six phases people undergo when change occurs.


Anticipation. This is the waiting phase where people don't know what to expect and wait for what the future has in store.
Confrontation. At this stage, people begin to realize that change is imminent, or in some cases, already under way.
Realization. People enter Phase 3 once change has occurred. This is where the realization sinks in that things will always be different.
Depression. As well as realizing the change intellectually, people are now realizing the change emotionally and are mourning the past.
Acceptance. Now, people are comprehending the change emotionally as well. It is not uncommon for people to maintain some reservations about the change, but at this phase little effort is made to fight the change. Benefits from the change are acknowledged but not always fully reassuring.
Enlightenment. People are now fully accepting of the change and often wonder how they ever managed under the ""old"" way.

, The reason for this is that people go through the above phases at different rates of speed. One person may require three months to reach Phase 6, while another a full year. Also, people do not undergo these phases in a linear order, but rather jump around. For example, an individual may go from 4 to 6 and back to 2.

Survey your employees.",How to Improve Internal Communication," It's a two way street. First, teach people to give feedback on information they get. Second, create and reward open dialogue.;
, If you need to improve internal communication, the best place to start is from managers. Tell managers to start by sharing, commenting and giving feedback.

, Show employees the value and excite them about the cause of sharing information.

, Publish company, team and individual goals online and make them visible for everyone. Start from researching OKR - objectives and key results -, a popular process used by Google.

, We all know that meetings can be a waste of time, so reduce that time. Use online team update and reporting tools.

, Annual performance reviews aren't going to cut it. Make communication a weekly process with defined rules.

, Writing is a skill that can be mastered. Most people are use to writing for themselves, not for others.

, People are used to getting information on the go. Provide information in a way that best suits their busy needs.

, To get answers and be aware of the current state, run regular employee surveys.

Develop relationships with the people you manage.,
Set a good example.,
Demonstrate integrity.,
Evaluate policies and procedures.,
Communicate your expectations clearly and accurately.,
Explain all goals and objectives.,
Adjust your management style if it is not working well.,
Create a positive work environment.",How to Improve People Management," Flexibility is important in improving people management. The way you manage one person might be different than the way you manage another.


Schedule time to talk to people. Understanding their own personal strengths, challenges and goals will help you relate to them better and manage their work and contributions.;
, People management requires leadership, and the best way to lead is by example. You cannot create a separate set of rules for yourself. Hold yourself to the same standards as you hold other people.


Arrive to work, meetings and events on time or a little early. This shows the people you manage that you take your obligations seriously and you respect their time. Work hard. Others will notice if you take 2 hour lunch breaks or leave early on a regular basis.

, Show people that you are honest and trustworthy. Say what you mean and if you do not know the answer to someone's question, admit to it.

, If something is taking a lot of time for one of your employees and she has a better idea of how to get the result, be willing to listen. The people you manage will find you responsive.


Ask for input before you make any major systematic or procedural changes. This will allow the people you manage to feel heard, even if the result is something they are not happy about.

, Everyone you manage should understand their roles and what they need to do.


Share performance standards and let everyone know what success will look like. In his book ""First, Break All the Rules,"" Marcus Buckingham says that people must know what is expected of them before they can succeed. Communicating better is a great way to improve people management.

, People are often willing to work harder when they understand why they are doing what is asked of them.


Be specific in your explanations. For example, instead of saying ""I need the sales report by the end of the month,"" you could say ""I need the sales report by the end of the month so I can forecast our sales goals for next month.""

, Note what types of your own behavior bring the best performance results. Some people prefer an authoritative manager and others work better with a manager who thinks of himself as a team member.

, Your culture will help inspire and motivate others. Celebrate victories, show your appreciation and publicly reward people who surpass expectations.

Find a mentor.",How to Increase Your Confidence when Addressing Workplace Issues," Do it! If you’re a doctor, you wouldn’t dream of diagnosing someone without proper training and if you drive a forklift, you wouldn’t do so without gaining the necessary certificate or license. So why when you start to manage people, would you assume you can just muddle through? Investing in a training course from a specialist company can equip you with the skills to deal with any issues which come your way, potentially saving your company money in the long run. Rather than any dispute leading to costly legal action, you will be able to step in to mediate between employees before the situation escalates.;
, While it’s human nature that the parties involved will be looking to play the blame game, if you’re leading a mediation process then your role is to remain impartial. That means you don’t have to worry about sitting in judgement about who is right or wrong. Just remember, you are there to help the parties reach an agreement about the best way forward

, Think carefully about what you want to say at the outset, and even practicing a few times at home perhaps, you will give off an aura of confidence which will help employees feel that you are capable of helping them get through a difficult situation. When settling a dispute, it’s important the parties involved know what it acceptable and what is not during discussions and negotiations.

, It’s much easier to tell someone they are doing something well than set out what you feel they are doing wrong. Even if you think behaviour has fallen below standards in the run up to you becoming involved, you can still let your employees know that you have every confidence in them going forward because you are positive they will be able to reach an agreement for the future.

, Act confident, even if you don’t feel confident, act it. Just as smiling or laughing for no apparent reason can make you feel happier, acting confident can lead to you feeling more self-assured. Think about your posture and the signals your body language is sending out, walk tall and use hand gestures which invite openness.

, If, when dealing with an issue between employees, the discussion becomes heated, don’t be afraid to take a break. That way, the parties involved get a chance to cool down and you get a chance to think about how you will handle the situation to make sure everyone remains calm once they come back into the room.

, Don’t feel too pressurised to hold all the solutions because your job in dealing with issues between employees is to help them to find the way forward themselves. Encourage them to find compromises and to tell you what they think will work for everyone.

, Having reached an agreement, put that in a document, using the employees own words and phrases to set out how everyone will work together in the future. Having a written agreement should give everyone confidence that it will be adhered to.

, By making sure you’re informed about the latest legal issues and the newest methods for dealing with any conflict or issues in the workplace, you’ll be arming yourself with the best tools to use day-to-day at work.

, Mentors are invaluable no matter what rung of the career ladder you have reached. You don’t have to be a junior member of staff to benefit from the advice of someone who has been there and done that. If there’s no one suitable in your workplace, could you use networking events like business breakfasts to mingle with those who have been in your shoes or could you seek advice through social media? Finding out how others deal with difficult situations should help you to find the confidence to deal with your own.

Determine the goal of the incentive.,
Identify the audience.,
Choose the right incentive structure.,
Budget properly.,
Get the rewards right.,
Get an expert to operate the incentive.,
Communicate effectively.,
Track performance.,
Celebrate the winners.,
Keep up the momentum.",How to Launch a Successful Incentive Program," Before you begin to develop an incentive, it’s vital that you know why you’re launching it and what you want it to achieve (increasing sales, driving turnover of a new product, inspiring loyalty, etc.). Clarity at the start is crucial.;
, Once you’re certain of the reasons behind the incentive and you know your goals, the next step is to identify exactly who should take part in the programme (i.e. those people who can help you achieve your goal). These could be staff from your company, from your distributor channel, etc.

, Deciding on the most appropriate incentive programme is a very important step. Inclusive, exclusive or product-specific incentives, or incentives that operate on multiple levels are all options available to you.

, Incentives are not expensive luxuries. Properly designed and managed, they should be self-funding strategic tools, the cost of which is covered by increased sales or stronger cost-efficiencies. You should generate return on your investment. The reward accounts for the majority of expenditure but promotion and administration are also crucial, both of which should be covered upfront.

, Every employee, whatever their position, wants recognition. Therefore, you must put in place a reward portfolio whose content appeals to a broad spectrum of lifestyles (and thus encourages all employees to participate). Suggestion prizes may include boutique hotel weekends, state-of-the-art electronics, the latest music, films and computer games, and vouchers for the top high-street retailers.

, Once you’ve put down the foundations of a successful incentive programme, it’s time to seek professional expertise in order to maximise your investment, both financial and physical. The PointBank team is bursting with know-how and entrepreneurial flair and its talents are much sought after.

, An incentive programme cannot work without proper communication. Communication must be consistent from beginning to end and the more creative the better. The more excitement that is generated around the incentive, the greater the participation, and the better the results. Don’t forget to communicate the incentive’s success after it has finished.

, Being able to track the performance of your incentive and assess its effectiveness, whether during or after the programme, is very important. To be able to access feedback and view return on investment is invaluable, whether in terms of deciding on the next strategic step or improving the operation of an existing incentive.

, Don’t let your incentive flounder by not properly recognising your winners. They have worked very hard, so celebrate their achievement in front of their peers, backed up with a personal note of congratulation. This will make them feel special and will encourage others to improve their own performance.

, Don’t be tempted to switch off once your incentive has come to an end. Be savvy and think how you can use the information you’ve gained from past programmes to improve your next one. The better and more popular you can make your incentives, the stronger the results will be.

Collect information on all the (High Priority) P1 and P2 incidents.,
Group all the similar outages and categorize them.,
Analyze the root cause for each group of events.,
Check whether the fix that your teams provided were temporary or permanent.,
Think of permanent solutions.,
Tackle particularly ""unsolvable"" problems with the Pareto Principle.,
Document solutions.,
Work ahead of schedule.,
Provide service at speed of thought.",How to Improve Your IT Service Management Process," Review the outage summaries and resolution data, and also arrange a meeting with all the teams who were involved in resolving those issues.;
, You'll want to categorize by vendor, application name, customer (LOB), and time. For this process, you have to:


Collect all the major incident problem statements/cases/issues that occurred in past one year.
Group together the incidents having similarities with respect to the incident type and outage.

, Determine why the outages occurred. For instance, you might find that there were 4 major incidents in the past one year and among the 4 incidents, 3 incidents were related to the servers going down.

, Consider the fact that some fixes looks like permanent but result in a problem recurring over time (for example, software vulnerability patch updates etc).


If the fix was not permanent but end users and clients were happy after the fix and business is continuing, then do not think that you are totally safe, because again this may haunt in future. So identify and work it out during this service outage analysis period.

, Whether for practice and analysis or actual implementation, focusing on permanent solutions both for existing problems and for past problems can help improve your service delivery.


If you still have the capacity/opportunity to deliver a permanent fix for a problem that you previously provided a temporary solution for, do so. You have to test and give it a trial run, perform user acceptance tests, and get the plan signed off on by stakeholders/ clients. Then one fine day implement this change, after thoroughly following the change management process.
Spending time analyzing where your service is falling short and what could have been done better in past cases will help you provide better service in the future.

, In cases where you are unable to identify the root cause of service problems, divide the problem into smaller pieces. Use a divide and conquer strategy by recalling the Pareto Principle (which says that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes). Always consider People, Process, and Technology.


People: Was this major outage caused due to the lack of a collaborative approach or a lack of knowledge among your people? Are they equipped to prevent this kind of outage?
Process: Was this major outage caused due to too much process or a lack of process awareness among employees?
Technology: Did you have the right set of tools to resolve the incident or not?

, Technical teams tend to show more enthusiasm to take the challenges and resolve issues quickly. One key missing thing here is that they neglect to document the resolution or fix that they have applied to resolve that major incidents. It's quite natural that some people feel too tired and burnt out on a given problem to document the solution.


Unfortunately this causes major risk for industries in terms of business continuity when individuals move away. It becomes inevitable that companies need to invest their time and money on new/replacement employees who need to solve the same problem again and again. If solutions are documented, they can be used again efficiently, and even improved upon.
Consider allocating one resource (a point person) who can document all the technical people's resolution activities as and when major incidents occurs.

, Consider setting up a dummy deadline and virtual delivery points for your team. If your teams are asked to deliver services/products prior to the actual required date, they'll have time to solve problems before the customer is expecting the final result.

, Focus on efficiency and quick customer satisfaction. This can be easily implemented if you have the information available or knowledge available at your finger tips. Clients and customers will always be impressed ""how fast your respond and how accurate your response is"".

, Establish protocols with clients on how inquiries will be handled.

,


Spend time watching the local television newscasts, listening to local radio and reading local newspapers and magazines.
Become aware of the reporters and their specialties. You will build a rapport more quickly with a reporter with whose work you are familiar.

,


Maintain a social media presence through such venues as Twitter and Facebook. Use these wisely to increase visibility and provide helpful information without ""spamming"" or bombarding recipients with annoying and irrelevant messages. Consider developing an agency blog on current industry issues, becoming a contributor to an industry blog or a columnist on advertising issues for the local business press.

,


Return calls promptly and always include a cell phone number or alternate contact information on your office voice mail greeting. A call returned after deadline can damage your client's and your own credibility with the reporter.
Initiate contacts with reporters at times that are between their deadlines: don't call radio reporters at the top or bottom of the hour, call television reporters and assignment editors early in the day.
If you do not have the information the reporter is requesting, tell him or her you will need to find the information. Call back promptly with the results of your research.

,


Never ask for advance copies of interview questions or to preview and approve an article before publication.
Do not expect favorable coverage based either on personal relationships or on your client's advertising relationship with the reporter's employer.
Be firm but polite if you must decline to offer a comment or to answer a question. Never seem evasive or defensive.

,


Whether speaking on behalf of your agency or a client, take the time to consider the points most important for you to convey. List all of the questions you think the reporter may ask and prepare your answers. This will help you answer questions with confidence while remaining focused on the message you need to deliver.

Consider offering a severance amount or other assistance.",How to Help Avoid Employee Lawsuits," One reason that employees may feel that they were treated unfairly or fired unjustifiably is because they did not have a clear understanding of the company’s policies and procedures. It is important that your business draft an employee handbook that clearly explains the company’s rules regarding reviews, job requirements, promotion, vacation and sick leave, disciplinary process, and any other topics relevant to employment.


The handbook should be written in a way that is easy for an employee to understand and follow. ;
, While an employer has the right to create standards for employee evaluation, it is very important that each employee is evaluated based on the standards set out in the handbook. Employee obligations and performance requirements should be related to each position and have measurable goals outlined in the handbook. This gives employers a clear guide for evaluating employees and details for employees what they must do to meet the requirements for the position., Once you have set forth your company’s rules and regulations in an employee handbook, you should have the handbook reviewed by an employment lawyer. An employment lawyer will review your handbook and make sure it is in compliance with employment law, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and any other relevant law. A lawyer will also be able to make sure that your handbook is not misleading, and does not create any inadvertent promises to employees., You should regularly have your polices and procedures reviewed by an employment lawyer to ensure that they are consistent with evolving laws. If you update your policies and procedures make sure that you provide all employees with a copy of the new document or at least provide them notice of the new document and a link to where they can access the revised handbook.


If possible, you should have your employees either sign an acknowledgement that they received the document or email. If you are in a larger company or you don’t want to print the document, make sure that the document is emailed to all employees., When you evaluating potential employees, it is important that you closely evaluate the person’s work history to determine whether he or she has been a problem employee for past employers. One way to evaluate an employee’s past performance is by checking his or her references. Some previous employers will only provide verification of employment but others will provide positive recommendations for good employees. You should also interview all potential employees and ask why he or she left her previous positions. The offered reason may give you some insight into the person’s work history and ability to succeed at your company., A potential red flag when interviewing a prospective employee is gaps in the person’s resume or many positions only held for a short time. If the person has not worked for long stretches of time or changes jobs often it is important for you to discuss this in the employment interview. If the potential employee does not provide you with good justifications for gaps in employment or for changing jobs frequently, you may want to hire someone else., During your initial interview with a prospective employee, you should clearly outline the expectations for the position as set forth in your employee handbook. During the employee’s first day, the employee should be given a copy of the employee handbook and he or she should sign an acknowledgement stating that the handbook was received. Your human resources person or the employee’s supervisor should explain the policies and procedures and tell the employee to let them know whether they have any questions after reviewing the material., A mistake that employer’s make and for which they are later sued is making promises that the employer does not intend to keep or cannot keep. For example, if you offer an employee a position and state that this is a long-term position so that the employee leaves his or her current job for your company, you may be creating an implied contract. If you later fire that employee after only a short period of time has passed, the employee may have a case for breach of an implied contract.


An employer can be optimistic about a person’s future with the company. However, an employer should be careful not to make statements that imply a definitive commitment to long-term employment, such as “We want you to retire with this company.”
Avoid promises about the future, including promises about potential compensation and employment., Regardless of the size of your company, you should have all of your managers take part in antidiscrimination training. This ensures that your managers are aware of their legal responsibilities, can recognize discriminatory behavior, and allows you to hold your managers and supervisors accountable for their conduct.Additionally, in order to have a productive workplace, it may benefit your company to have your managers trained in effective employee relations.


Employee training for best practices can include how to document performance, give efficient and effective feedback, how to review employees for their performance rather than their individual traits, and other management techniques.
Management training should also include an overview of employment law, antidiscrimination law and law related to people with disabilities. By educating managers on their legal responsibilities, you are lessening the likelihood of an employee lawsuit., It is important that managers not only be instructed in their legal responsibilities but also that your business adopt policies and procedures related to discrimination and harassment. There should be a clear path for an employee to report harassment or discrimination by another employee or a manager. Make sure that your policy sets for the procedures for an employee to report his or her supervisor for inappropriate or unlawful conduct., It is important that mangers and supervisors document employee performance and disciplinary actions consistently and uniformly for all employees. As part of manager training, they should be instructed on how to complete employee evaluations and that all poor performance should be documented. Managers must understand that if they are going to write up one person for specific conduct that they must write up everyone who engages in that conduct. If the company has a practice of giving a verbal warning before a written warning, managers must consistently follow the company’s policies., Business owners or others should review manager’s performance and evaluate the performance reviews that the manager gave for consistency, fairness, and legality. If numerous employees refuse to sign their performance reviews or challenge a manager’s evaluation of their work, it is important for you to determine whether the manager is successfully performing his or her duties and appropriately following the companies policies and procedures., If your policies are imprecise or your managers fail to follow the policies appropriately, it is important for the company to acknowledge and rectify any mistakes. This may include rewriting the policies and procedures or disciplining an ineffective or inappropriate manager. It is important to handle the consequences of the mistakes fairly and treat your employees respectfully., All businesses should have a regular review process for its employees. During this process it is very important that managers give honest feedback about how the employee is performing his or her job. If you are giving an employee a bad performance review, you should speak in specific terms, explaining in what ways the person was failing to meet the job requirements. You should also provide the employee with concrete examples on how he or she can improve her performance.You are not judging a person on his or her personality but rather how the employee performs the essential tasks of the job.
Similarly, when offering praise for a job well done, that praise should be based on performance not on non-job related trait such as age.If your are consistently providing honest feedback about your employee’s performance, an employee should not be surprised if after numerous poor performance reviews you make a decision to terminate your employment relationship., If you reward an employee for good performance with a cash bonus or time-off award, do not give these same benefits to poor performing employees. While some business owners may feel badly about withholding bonuses or giving smaller raises, an underperforming employee can use your awards as evidence countering a termination based on poor performance., It is important to respect that your employee’s have private lives and that an employee has a right to his or her privacy. You should be as accommodating as possible to family emergencies or personal obligations. This may lessen the likelihood of an employee filing a lawsuit against your company.Although it may surprise you, this simple step can often eliminate or greatly reduce your chances of getting sued. Most employment lawsuits are not brought solely because of discrimination or some other legal claim, but because the boss was mistreating an employee. Managers who do not respect their employees will get sued more often. Even if a manager does nothing wrong and the lawsuit is thrown out, these cases drive up the legal costs of an organization. People do not want to sue individuals they like and respect.

, While it may be that you have to lay off a number of employees due to downsizing, if you have maintained a positive and fair workplace, employees may be less likely to file a lawsuit. In order to treat employees fairly, you should follow the company’s policies and procedures, treat employees consistently, be honest during performance reviews and answer employee’s questions candidly. It is very important, with regards to disciplinary proceedings, that you handle matters consistently so that an employee does not feel as if he or she has been singled out., It is important that you establish a clear method for making complaints so that employees do not fear retribution from supervisors or coworkers. You should also have a way for employees to dispute their performance evaluations or disciplinary actions, if they feel the actions were unfair.


You can have both an informal process and formal process for grievance. An informal process may be that the employee verbally reports their grievance to a supervisor and a formal process may include a written statement or other documentation of the grievance., Employers should both listen to their employees’ complaints and ideas and keep employees informed about issues that may impact his or her job. By having transparency and an open dialogue between employers and employees, you minimize the likelihood of misunderstandings that could lead to a lawsuit.

, If an employee raises a complaint, you should investigate the complaint promptly, and tell the for example a key employee is out of the office, explain to the reporting employee why there is a delay and when the investigation will occur., As an employer, it is important that you educate yourself and your managers on employment-related law, and discrimination and harassment. By receiving training about the law, writing an effective employee handbook, creating an atmosphere of inclusivity and responding to any claims of harassment or discrimination, you can protect yourself against lawsuits.You may need to provide accommodations for people with disabilities.
You cannot terminate employees for actions related to public policy, such as serving on a jury, refusing to engage in price fixing or in retaliation for a workers’ compensation claim.
Do not discriminate against employees based on race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or national origin.
Do not engage in or allow any type of harassment in your company., As discussed above, you should be evaluating all of your employees’ performances on a regular basis. If you have a consistently underperforming employee, you must document his or her performance, discuss the performance with the employee, provide concrete ways to improve and explain the consequences of the employee’s failure to meet expectations. By documenting the employee’s poor performance as it occurs, you have provided the employee with notice of the company’s expectations and the opportunity to improve his or her work., If you decide to terminate an employee for poor performance, you want to do so personally and with care. You should call them into your office and clearly state that they are being terminated and explain why. An employee who seems surprised by the fact that they are being fired is more likely to sue.If you fire an employee for poor performance who has consistently had positive performance reviews, the employee may file a lawsuit stating that you fired the employee for a discriminatory reason since there is no evidence of poor performance., In order to keep a positive relationship with your employee, you can consider offering the terminated employee a small severance amount. Some employers offer employees a severance amount so long as they agree to sign a waiver stating that they are not going to file a lawsuit.Before making this type of offer, you should consult an attorney to make sure you are not violating any employment laws.

Consult with a labor and employment lawyer.",How to Give a Negative Employee Reference," You aren’t obligated to write a reference unless it says in the employment contract that you will give one.For that reason, you should consider saying “no.” Negative references can be more trouble than they are worth.


If the person asking for the reference is a former employee, you can tell them they would be better off choosing someone more familiar with their recent work.
However, if the employee is a current employee, you may be tempted to give a reference just to get rid of them.;
, Don’t beat around the bush. Instead, tell the employee you can’t write a positive reference.This will give the employee a chance to choose someone else for a reference.


You can say, “Sorry, Janet, I’m not sure I can write a really strong reference. Are you sure you can’t find someone else?”

, If you choose to go ahead with the reference, you should carefully review the employee’s file so that you only state accurate information. Remember that you can be sued for anything false in the reference. Accordingly, make sure everything you write in your reference is factual.For example, the employee could sue you for defamation, which is a false statement that injures the person. An employee can sue for defamation if you lie and the lie costs the employee a job.

, It’s a better idea to write an employee reference than give one over the phone. By writing a letter, you preserve proof of exactly what you told a potential employer.Set up the letter like a standard business letter.


Choose a font that most people can read. Generally, Times New Roman or Arial 12 point works best.

, You should keep the reference as brief as possible. You can begin the review by providing the basics about the employee, such as the following:when the employee worked for you
job title
their pay rate (optional)

, After providing the facts, you may want to give your impressions of the employee. You need to be careful here. Make sure not to be too negative. Avoid speculation or relaying gossip you heard about the employee. Instead, base your opinions on your direct observations.Remember that you can be negative—provided the negative information is accurate.


You can avoid being too negative by providing some balance. Think of something positive you can say about the employee. For example, an employee may have been incompetent but pleasant. You can praise their sunny attitude.
Alternately, the employee might have been a bad fit for your company based on personality. However, they may have done detailed work.

, You also shouldn’t cover up any employee misconduct.You may be tempted, especially if the employee is weak and you want them to move on. However, if you lie, then a potential employer could sue you for misrepresenting the truth.


For example, avoid saying “Karen is the best employee I have ever had” if you have evidence in the employee’s file that they were a mediocre employee. Positive comments also need to be supported with evidence.
Failure to disclose relevant information is also a problem. For example, a dental assistant may have shown up drunk or high and proceeded to try and clean teeth. You will need to disclose that type of information to a potential employer in order to protect yourself from being sued. Don’t simply say you “fired” the employee.
Also disclose thefts, violent behavior, and sexual harassment in addition to drug or substance abuse problems.

, Give the employee another chance to decide not to use you as a reference. Show them the letter before you mail it out. Ask the employee a second time if they want to use your reference letter.


Give them about a week to decide. Wait for them to give you the go ahead before sending it out.
Usually, an employee will decide not to use a negative reference. However, they could be in a tight spot. A potential employer might be insisting that they get a reference from their current employer.

, If the employee wants the letter but dislikes your comments, ask if you can just provide the factual details of their employment: date, pay, etc. If so, you can strip out any negative commentary.


You should also consider having the employee sign a release.

, When an employee signs a release, they agree not to sue you for defamation or any other injury suffered as a result of the reference. There are many samples you can use online as models when drafting your own. Search “employee reference release” online.


Realize that the release doesn’t protect you from lawsuits from potential employers for misrepresentation. You must still be 100% factual and honest in your reference.

, You can type up your own basic employment reference release by opening a blank word processing document and setting the font to a readable size and style, e.g., 12-point type.


Insert a title at the top of the page—“Employment Reference Release.”You should probably set up the document as a template, with blank lines for information that will change with each release. This way, you can use the release more than once.

, The release is a legal agreement between you (the company) and an employee. Provide this information at the top of the page underneath the title.


For example, you can write, “This Employment Reference Release (the ‘Agreement’) is made and effective on between the ‘Employee’ and ABC Company (the ‘Company’), an LLC organized and existing under the laws of Michigan, with its main office located at . In consideration of the promises made herein, the parties agree to be legally bound as follows:”, Insert a paragraph where you lay out the information you will share with a potential employer. Remember to reserve the right to decide what information you will release.


For example, you can write, “By signing this Agreement, Employee voluntarily requests that Company depart from its general policy regarding reference requests. Employee authorizes Company to provide employment-related information to any prospective employer considering Employee for hire. Employee authorizes Company to disclose, in its sole discretion and judgment, any information Company determines is appropriate to disclose, including evaluations, assessments, or information Company has about Employee’s behavior and performance.”, The release is an explicit promise from the employee to not hold you legally responsible for any fallout from your reference. Remember to obtain protection for the company as well as for individual employees who give the reference.


For example, you can write: “In exchange for Company’s agreement to disclose additional employment-information at Employee’s request, Employee agrees to release and discharge Company and Company’s successors, officers, directors, and employees from all claims, causes of action, and liabilities, known or unknown, arising from or in any manner connected to Company’s disclosure of employment-related information to potential employers. This release includes (but is not limited to) claims of libel, slander, defamation, negligence, or interference with profession or contract.”, You’ll need these provisions to protect you in case the employee later objects to your reference. Include the following provisions:The employee has carefully read the agreement.
The employee had an opportunity to consult a lawyer or any person of their choosing before signing the agreement.
The employee has signed the release voluntarily and without coercion.
The release contains the entire agreement between the parties and replaces all other agreements on the subject matter.

, Insert a signature block for both a company representative and the employee to sign.Don’t mail out a reference letter until you have a signed release on file.


If the employee refuses to sign a release, you should strongly consider not providing a reference beyond basic information.

, By having a policy in place, you’ll know exactly how to respond to any reference request. For example, some companies have a policy of only providing bare bones information, such as the dates of employment, job title or description, and pay rate.You can set your own policy. For example, you might want to provide more extensive references for employees. If so, you can make it a policy to ask employees to sign releases before you provide a fuller reference letter.

, Fellow coworkers might want to give references, even if the company doesn’t. You’ll need to consider whether to allow personal references and come up with policies about them. For example, a personal reference occurs when Jane Smith says, “I’m speaking as Jane Smith, but not as a representative for the company.”If you allow personal references, include a policy prohibiting the use of company letterhead or the company address.
Also make sure employees state in their reference that they are not speaking on behalf of the company.

, If you decide to provide only basic information, then pick one person in Human Resources to provide this information.By training and using one person, you’ll make fewer errors.


When another person is asked to provide a reference, they should refer the employee to HR.
HR should also keep detailed notes about the references they give out: who it was given to and the employee it was about., Include the policy in employment contracts and employee manuals or handbooks. You want everyone to know what the company’s position is regarding work references. Also include information about a release.


For example, you could publish a sample release in your employee handbook so employees can see what they are agreeing to before asking you to provide a reference.

, If you’re just beginning to think about references, you should consult with a lawyer to help you navigate the legal maze.Each state has different laws related to the information you can give about an employee.


For example, in some states, you can only provide information about an employee with their consent.California also provides legal protection when giving answers to certain questions.You can find a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association. Set up a consultation with the lawyer and discuss your legal obligations as an employer. Also discuss what your company’s reference policy should be.

Apply for entry level jobs on a management track.,
Talk to your boss or human resources department about enrolling yourself in a management training course, at the company's expense.,
Propose a company or department-wide management training session.",How to Get Management Training1," Many companies still like to train and hire from within, so that their employees are prepared to manage specifically within the company's rules and culture. Look for ""management training"" or ""management track"" in the job descriptions.


These jobs often require a serious commitment of 1 to 5 years in order to work up into mid-level manager status. Make sure you are prepared to commit the time, if the company wants to commit the resources to train you. It is unlikely that you will get exceptional references if you leave the job before your commitment is fulfilled.;
, Many companies are aware that many employee issues stem from management problems. Suggest a time management, team management, project management or other course that would improve your performance and your skill set.


When proposing a management course to upper management, it is a good idea to pick a program that is local and not too expensive. Although good training may not be cheap, it should be a good value for the skills learned. Research local training programs and propose the best option or options to your superiors.

, Speak to upper management about hiring an outside trainer to instruct your mid or upper-level management. It is a good idea to specify the type of management training, so that the company can target its areas of improvement.


Some companies and management training programs are structured as whole-day events, while others are set up in small blocks. If there is a lot of training to be done in your company, consider choosing small blocks of training, so that managers have time to absorb the material and put it into practice.

Enroll in a business management or business administration class at a Lifelong Learning Center or community college.,
Enroll in an Executive Education program.,
Enroll in a Master's of Business Administration (MBA) degree.",How to Get Management Training2," Once you join, you can gain access to seminars, books, webcasts and even management job listings. If you want to enhance your management skills independently, then this is a good place to start.

, This is especially helpful if you have started your own business and you are trying to manage, delegate or hire managers. There are a number of ways that you can find a management mentor.

If you already know the person well, then it can be a long-standing mentor/mentee relationship, where you can seek advice as problems arise.
Consult a business mentor website such as Pivot Planet. This website sets up advisers with people who would like to learn a new job or skill. Once you become a member, you can start coaching or informational sessions via web chat.

, Many local agencies offer low cost classes on business topics, including management. These can fill in small gaps in management knowledge, but should not be seen as full management training.

, Many universities, from local to ivy league, offer 2-day to 2-month courses specially designed for executives and upper management. These are expensive programs; however, the certification provides very valuable knowledge, networking and improves your resume.

, These 2 to 3 year degrees are offered by many 4-year universities. While this requires a significant commitment in time and money, it is the comprehensive way to learn all aspects of business management.


Many MBA programs can be at least partially completed online. If you have a steady job and do not want to take a break to attend a university, research MBA programs that offer online management courses and weekend classes. In some cases, this program may take longer than 2 years.

,How to Give a Positive Reference for an Employee1,
"
Offer to write a positive letter.,
Gather information to incorporate into your letter.,
Draft a preliminary letter.,
Use positive and actionable words.,
Be honest and don’t exaggerate.,
Revise and copy edit your letter.,
Format your letter.,
Proofread one final time.",How to Give a Positive Reference for an Employee2," If someone approaches you about providing them a reference, first consider their request. If you have had a good experience with the person and can positively support their candidacy for a position, then offer to write them a positive letter.


Don’t offer to write a letter if you cannot write anything positive. You don’t want to hurt the person’s chances of getting a job.Only accept providing a reference if you’ve worked with the person for a longer period of time. It’s hard to get a sense of someone’s capabilities and working style in a few months.Make sure that you are the appropriate person to provide the reference. This may require checking your company’s policies on references.

, Ask the person to give you information on the job for which they’re applying and any other relevant data you should know including her resume.You should also collect any information pertinent to the person’s job for you such as performance reviews.Ask the person for whom you will write a reference letter to tell you about the job for which you will be recommending her, an updated resume, and other information such as how she thinks she contributed to your company or projects and how she could benefit her new workplace.Consider reading through your correspondence with the person to get an assessment of their professionalism and how they work. You can also use performance reviews for this purpose., Before you provide the person a positive reference for your former employee or colleague, use the information you gathered to draft a preliminary letter. This will help you ensure that your reference is positive and comprehensive.


A reference letter should be between one and two pages in length. If you write anything longer, the potential employer may not read the entire text and could miss vital information about the candidate.A brief introduction should state the person’s name, the job for which they’re applying, and if you recommend them for the position.For example, you could write “It is with pleasure that I recommend Christopher Smith for the position of brand manager. Christopher has made a significant contribution to my work/ this company, and I think he could be a great asset to your team.”
The body of the letter can be 1-3 paragraphs and should discuss how long you’ve known the person, in what capacity you’ve worked together, discuss and highlight their skills, and address how the person could benefit the potential employer.You want to provide actionable evidence of why the person is the best candidate for the job.You can also discuss the person’s character in the main body of the letter, though you should be careful to not include personal information, which may not only prejudice a potential employer, but could also be illegal.You should close with a brief summary paragraph noting that you highly recommend the person, and offering to make yourself available should the potential employer have questions.For example, “Based on my experiences with Christopher Smith, I would recommend him for the position of brand manager with Brand Management, Inc. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me via email or by telephone.”

, When you’re drafting and later revising your reference letter, you want to make sure to use both positive and actionable language when describing the candidate. This can help the potential employer get a better sense of the candidate and may also present a more positive image of her.Use verbs such as collaborate, cooperate, and promote.Use nouns such as team-player, asset, and responsibility.Use adjectives such as reliable, intelligent, good-natured, diligent.You can put these words together in phrases such as “Christopher and I collaborated on a marketing project and he was a significant asset in our gaining several new clients. He is a responsible and friendly team-player who will make a positive impact on your company.”, You want to sell the candidate as best as possible while being honest about their qualifications. There is a fine line between honesty and exaggeration and you want to avoid this so that potential employers don’t find your letter disingenuous.You don’t necessarily need to say the person is the best or the greatest unless they actually are. Instead, consider writing something like “Christopher is one of the most responsible and collegial co-workers with whom I’ve had the pleasure to work.” When assessing someone’s technical skills and abilities, you can write something along the lines of “Christopher is among the top 5% of brand managers with whom I have worked.”

, Once you’ve drafted a preliminary letter, revise the text to strengthen it and iron out any areas that need additional development. This will also allow you to copy edit the letter for any spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors.


Make sure you’re revised draft has the appropriate components of an introduction, body, and closing that are honest, incorporate positive vocabulary and present the best picture of the candidate possible.Consider reading the letter aloud to hear possible mistakes and help ensure that it sounds professional.Make sure that the information you provide in the letter is tailored to the new job., Before you can send out a reference letter, you need to format it properly. This can help ensure that the potential employer takes your reference letter seriously.Make sure the letter is on company letterhead.On the first line of text, write in the date of the reference letter.
Immediately underneath the date, put the address of the potential employer. Address it either to the candidate’s possible supervisor or the human resources department.
Include your contact address underneath the potential employer’s information.
After your greeting, make sure to sign your name in black ink and have your name printed underneath it. You can include your title, email, and phone number if you like.

, Before you send the reference letter, read over the text one final time. This can help ensure that you haven’t made any mistakes or omitted important information.

Some may only allow for written references. Confirming your company’s reference policy can help ensure that you provide the best possible verbal reference.

, If an employee or colleague asks you to give her a reference, make sure you can positively accept the request. If you have had a good experience with the person and can support her application, then offer to provide a reference with the potential employer.


Don’t offer to serve as a reference if you cannot say something positive about the person. You don’t want to subvert her chances of getting the job.Only agree to speak to a potential employer if you’ve worked with the person for a while. It may be difficult to answer questions about a person or her skills in a few months.Make sure that you are the appropriate person to provide the reference, which may require checking with your boss or the company’s policies on references.

, You’ll need some basic information from the person about the job for which they’re applying and any other relevant data that you should know.Request information about the candidate’s potential job and an updated resume. You may even want an assessment of how she thinks she contributed to your company or projects and how she could benefit her new workplace.You should also collect any information pertinent to the person’s job for you such as performance reviews.Consider reading through your correspondence with the person to get an assessment of their professionalism and how they work.

, Once you’ve had a chance to schedule a meeting and gather some pertinent information, sketch some notes about the candidate. This can help ensure that you don’t forget important information about the candidate’s skills or behavior during the conversation.


Since you will not know what questions the potential employer may ask, make sure to write notes on various aspects of the candidate including how you know them and for how long, in what capacity you worked together, and an assessment of their skills.

, A verbal reference will often require you to answer questions a potential employer has about the candidate. Having notes and answer the questions as detailed and honestly as possible may help the candidate land the job.


Make sure that you don’t exaggerate the person’s qualifications. You don’t necessarily have to say “he’s the greatest ever”, but can objectively say “He’s one of the best colleagues/ employees I’ve ever had.”
Remember that hesitating on an answer may make it seem like you’re being dishonest.

, When you’re answering the potential employer’s questions, make sure to incorporate words that make the candidate attractive. This can give the candidate the edge over other people for the job.You can use a variety of verbs, nouns and adjectives to describe the person. The more descriptive you can be, the more helpful it is to the potential employer.For example, you can says things such as “Christopher is a very creative problem-solver,” or “she communicates her ideas clearly.”Make sure to use language that also incorporates skills the person will need in their new position.

, Only talk about things relevant to the person's job performance, such as his superior leadership skills or ability to resolve disputes among colleagues. Don't talk about his personal life because it may make him—and you-- seem less professional in the eyes of prospective employers.


Don’t discuss anything personal including religion, marital status, age or health.
Providing personal information could jeopardize the candidate’s chances of getting hired. It may also be illegal depending on the type of information you divulge.

, Conclude the phone reference once you’ve answered the potential employer’s questions. You may ask questions if you think it is necessary or will shed further light on the person. Make sure to thank the potential employer and offer to provide further information if necessary.

Meet with a lawyer.","How to Quit As an ""at Will"" Employee"," In almost every state, you are presumed to be an “at will” employee. If you don’t know what kind of employee you are, then you are probably “at will.”


You are not “at will” if you have an employment contract.Think back whether you signed an employment contract before you started working.
Go through your papers and see if you signed anything resembling an employment contract at any point in your employment.
Also think about any promises that you might have made. You can create an employment contract by making oral or written promises. For example, if you promised a boss not to quit without giving a month’s notice, then you might have created a contractual obligation.;
, As an “at will” employee, you can quit your job at any time and for any reason.Nevertheless, you should give some consideration to your employer’s needs. After all, you probably want a good work reference and you don’t want to burn bridges on your way out of the workplace.


If possible, don’t leave during a rush period. For example, if you work in sales, then you might want to wait until the Christmas rush finishes before giving your boss notice.

, You don’t have to give a reason for leaving.Nonetheless, your boss might ask. You should consider whether you want to give a reason.


If you got a great new job with better pay, then you should certainly tell your employer. They are often interested in knowing what the market pay is for jobs like yours.
You might not want to give a reason if you hated your job and only have negative things to say. In this case, you might just want to shake your head and say, “It’s for a lot of reasons.”

, You should tell your immediate supervisor in person that you are leaving.It’s common courtesy. Your boss might need you to write a letter, but you should initially tell them in person.


After telling your boss in person, you should follow up with an email. Be gracious but brief.
You can simply state, “I wanted to follow up on the conversation we had this morning, when I told you that I intend to leave the company on April 16, two weeks from now. It’s been a pleasure to work for you.”

, Your employer might need some time to find a replacement. Giving at least two weeks’ notice is fairly standard. By providing notice, you can help preserve the relationship with your boss.If you are higher up in your organization, then you might need to give more than two weeks’ notice.
However, you shouldn’t give notice too much time in advance.Your continued presence in the office can make you seem like an outsider and might make people uncomfortable.

, After telling your boss, you can tell your other colleagues. They will find out eventually, and there is no real reason to keep it a secret.


However, you must tell a consistent story.Don’t tell one person that you are leaving because you have found your dream job but tell someone else you are leaving because you hate your boss.
Your colleagues talk to each other. Word will get out, and people will lose respect for you if you are telling different stories about why you are leaving. Come up with one reason and stick to it.

, You can offer to train any replacement that your employer hires to take over your job.Even if your employer doesn’t take you up on the offer, the gesture puts you in a good light.


At a minimum, you should get your files in some sort of order. Many people let documents pile up around their desk because they instinctively know where something is in the pile.
A new employee, however, needs documents stored in an orderly file cabinet. For tips on how to organize files, see Organize Office Files.

, You should try to finish up large projects, even if you need to work extra hours in order to get everything done. This will reflect well on your professionalism.If you absolutely cannot finish everything, then try to leave detailed instructions for how your replacement can complete the project.

, You shouldn’t leave your workplace with any property that isn’t yours. If you are unsure about what is yours, then be sure to ask your employer. For example, you should not take:office supplies
client information
business records
phones or computers

, Your employer might ask you to do an exit interview. This is your choice. At the interview, someone from Human Resources will typically ask you questions about your job and what you liked or didn’t like.


If you choose to give an exit interview, then don’t unload on the interviewer. You might be tempted to explain everything you disliked about the job. It is in your best interest not to.
Word travels fast. Although you might be promised anonymity during the exit interview, you can’t be guaranteed it.Your best bet is to remain positive. If you have criticisms to make, then offer them in a constructive manner. For example, if a boss berates his subordinates, you could say, “I’m not sure Jim is really happy in his role. I don’t know. Maybe he should discuss transitioning to something more comfortable for him.” In this way, you tip off Human Resources that there might be a problem, but you couch it in a way that expresses concern.

, Remember that the relationships you formed at your job might come in handy in the future. Former colleagues might someday become bosses at companies who might hire you. You can try to keep in touch even after you are gone.


Create a LinkedIn profile and add the person to your network.You can also add close colleagues to Facebook or Twitter.However, only do this if you maintain your social media accounts for professional purposes. You shouldn’t add people if your Facebook page contains pictures of you getting drunk or behaving inappropriately.
Send an occasional email. Send an email every now and then and catch up on what people are doing. Try to get personal email addresses, since those follow a person around after they leave the company.

, Your employer needs to pay you promptly for any time worked. Your state sets time limits for when your employer must give you your final paycheck.Although the laws differ by state, you should certainly follow up with your employer if you are not paid by the next pay period.


For example, you might be paid on the last business day of the month. If you quit on the 12th, then you should wait until the end of the month. However, if you are not paid by that time, you should contact your employer.

, You might have quit because you felt that you had no other choice. When harassment on the job becomes so intolerable that you feel you have no choice but to leave, then you could bring a lawsuit for “constructive discharge.”A court will consider a variety of factors. For example, being demoted or receiving a reduction in pay are two factors a court will look at.
A court will also consider whether you were harassed or badgered. Often this type of abuse, when coupled with a demotion or reassignment, is proof of constructive discharge.
You also should gather evidence that you complained about the work conditions. There should be a paper trail of complaints using your employer’s grievance system. If you claim harassment without having ever formally complained, then a court might disbelieve you because you never documented the abuse while you were working.
You shouldn’t bring a constructive discharge claim lightly. Indeed, you should talk with a lawyer before proceeding. Nevertheless, it is an option if you were severely harassed at work.

, You might have legal issues you want to discuss. For example, your employer might not have sent your final paycheck on time, or the employer didn’t pay you for your accrued comp or vacation time. You should meet with a qualified attorney to discuss whether you have a legal claim.


You can find an employment lawyer by contacting your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.
After getting a referral, you can call and schedule a half hour consultation. During the consultation you can discuss whatever legal issue you have and ask the lawyer for advice.

Give feedback regularly.,
Schedule a conference with the other person.,
Deliver your feedback in person.,
Deliver the feedback in a discreet setting.,
Bring a witness.",How to Give Negative Feedback1," Both positive and negative feedback should be regularly communicated. This prevents any potential negative feedback from surprising the person receiving it. Be sure to generally have more positive feedback than negative. Follow the concept of the ideal praise to criticism ratio; five to one in favor of positive feedback is considered ideal., Arrange a time with the person where you will both have ample opportunity to voice your concerns. Ensure it’s a free time where neither of you have to finish abruptly, potentially leaving a testy situation unresolved. Schedule enough time so there is room for brainstorming about ideas for improvement.

, Impersonal methods and public criticism is generally handled worse than one-on-one interactions. Delivering what could be misconstrued as bad news in person provides a more attentive atmosphere. Providing the feedback in public, or electronically, creates too many potential issues and potential miscommunication possibilities.


Refrain from using email to deliver the negative feedback.Advise the person the meeting will be kept confidential.

, Create a calm atmosphere by picking out an undisturbed place to administer your advice. The choice of location is especially helpful if there is the potential for hard feelings or outbursts. Keep in mind, however, the negative feedback will likely cause the other person to be confrontational.

, Because negative feedback is uncomfortable and rarely appreciated, it may be best to have another set of eyes in the room. When delivering negative feedback in a professional setting, it is sometimes advisable to avoid mixed-gender encounters without witnesses.

Get permission to critique.,
Ask questions that prompt self-evaluation.,
Focus on positives.,
Determine the source of the issue.,
Remove emotional and personal content.,
Adjust feedback based on the other person’s level of experience.",How to Give Negative Feedback2," While some may not appreciate this approach, asking the other person if they would permit negative feedback is a great method to opening dialogue. It eases potential tension that could arise when the advice or feedback is unsolicited. Try an approach like the examples below:Would you mind if I offered some pointers?
Can I give you a little critique that might help you?

, Before and during the feedback, ask questions that get the other person to see their mistakes or flaws without you mentioning the issue. Prompt them to find ways they could have improved, and they may just give the negative feedback to themselves. Communicate that your motivation for the review is to facilitate progress, and they’re more likely to view it as a learning opportunity.Where do you suppose things went wrong?
What could you have done to improve the outcome?
Was there a decision you could have made to help?

, When positives are more frequent than negatives, the feedback is more likely taken earnestly. Evaluate the situation to find positive things to say in addition to the negative commentary you plan to provide. Do not include feedback or comments derived from other sources. Modify your approach with one of the following suggestions:The final product was pretty good, but there was one small part that needs tweaking.
I appreciate all the time and effort you’ve put into this, but we still need to put in some more work.
You’ve done great thus far, but we still need to make a few changes to get everything perfect.

, Feedback is improved when you understand the other person’s thought process. You may believe it’s better to do thing one way, but the other person may have an entirely different approach or perspective that has been successful in the past. Find out what led them to their actions or decisions.How, exactly, did you come up with the plan to put this in action?
Why did you decide to start the job in such a way?
Did you have a reference upon which you relied when making that decision?

, Keep everything as straight-laced as possible so the criticism is accepted. Remember the goal is the outcome, so focus on identifying problems and finding solutions. Remain completely objective throughout the interaction or meeting, and ensure the feedback is factually based. There may be extenuating circumstances that are hindering the other person from performing or acting in the manner they would normally.Avoid derogatory language wherever possible. This is unprofessional, and is counterproductive to obtaining the desired results.
Do not insult the person receiving the feedback. Remember, feedback is intended to modify behavior. Keep your criticism focused on actions and efforts.
Avoiding using the feedback period as a way to vent or unload stockpiled criticisms. Providing regular feedback, both positive and negative, can help to prevent building up this stockpile.Remain professional and impartial during your conversation.
Avoid comparing the person to someone who you feel is doing a better job.

, The point of the feedback is to improve future outcomes. Research has shown that as someone becomes more proficient at something, they become more accepting of criticism. Temper your negative feedback based on their likely receptiveness.To a beginner: I love your effort, but I'd like you to work on one small correction.

For an expert: The first step in your project is very substandard. It needs to be completely overhauled.

Provide examples of the person's performance you are pleased about, as well as areas in which you believe they fall short, adjusting each towards their level of experience.

"
"
Appreciate their perspective.,
Accept feedback in return.,
Assure the person there will be an opportunity to improve.",How to Give Negative Feedback3," Once you let the other person know the problem, genuinely listen to their point of view before speaking again. Appreciate what they have to say. Honestly absorb the experiences they have and their specific situation. Let them explain the details that led up to the ensuing negative feedback. It’s possible there is a completely rational explanation for the deficiency. , Once you've laid out the issue and repercussions, it's possible the other person has some feedback for you. Provide an opportunity for the person to voice their side and listen without interruption. Nobody is perfect, and it’s possible you may have misinterpreted the recipient’s actions or intent. Allowing the other person to provide their feedback also makes them feel as if they are part of making the final outcome., You don’t want the negative feedback to produce negative feelings or negative results. Negative feedback could potentially cause the other person to believe their friendship, job, or status is in jeopardy. Help steer their reaction by minimizing their reaction. Otherwise, they may react with drastic measures like looking for new friends or a new job.

"
"
Clarify the desired results of negative feedback.,
Compile examples of where the person has improved.,
Schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss progress.",How to Give Negative Feedback4," Provide ways that effort can be changed in relation to the project to bring about the desired result. Try to avoid focusing on the person themselves, instead focus on actions and efforts that led to the unwanted outcome. Develop the goals and explain that you will provide guidance as they work toward goal achievement., After the feedback, you’ll want to see if the suggestions have been acted upon. There could also still be areas in which the other person is still lacking. Ensure the expectations are precise and measurable, so that multiple follow-ups are not necessary.

, Remain in contact as often as necessary to ensure that the person remains on a positive track toward improving their performance, and remember to praise them for their improved efforts. The feedback may be a way for you to build a stronger bond with the other person. They may just thank you for the chance to prove their abilities in the future.An effective follow-up may actually lead to improvements beyond the desired expectations."

Weigh the pros and cons of giving feedback.,
Check your intentions.,
Assess how open your manager is to feedback.,
Ask questions when your manager requests feedback.,
Avoid giving feedback to unreceptive managers.",How to Give Feedback to Your Manager1," Whether your boss asked you for feedback or you volunteered, think about how giving feedback might benefit you or your workplace. Consider whether you face any risks in providing feedback to your manager.Try to see things from your manager's perspective. If you have a problem with the way they're doing something, figure out why they've chosen to use that method and how it benefits them. Make sure it's more than just a personal pet peeve of yours.
Look at alternatives that you think would work better, and try to walk through them in your mind. Decide whether the alternative is a significant improvement over the current situation.;
, Most managers welcome feedback that is intended to increase workplace efficiency or productivity or save the company money. Your intentions should be focused on some benefit to the business, not to yourself.Be especially wary of personal motives if you and your manager have a competitive relationship, or if you're also in the running for a management position. In this situation, your manager may suspect you have personal intentions even if you don't.

, Your manager may not be receptive to your feedback, depending on your relationship with them and how long you've been working together. This will determine how you approach your manager. For example, if you and your manager butt heads frequently, they may not be open to any feedback from you. In a volatile relationship, you'll want to tailor your feedback so that you focus on positive feedback first and emphasize that you have respect for your manager.When in doubt, approach your manager and simply ask if they would be open to feedback on a particular issue.
Unless you have a close relationship with your manager going back a year or more, they probably won't be open to general feedback about their management style.

, Typically when a manager requests feedback, they're really only looking for answers to one or two specific questions they have. If you talk about anything else, you risk overstepping your bounds.If there are other areas apart from those your manager listed on which you would like to give feedback, bring them up specifically. For example, you might say ""I know you're looking for feedback on the Lumbergh project, but I also have some thoughts on the handling of TPS Reports. Could I talk to you about that as well?""

, Even if your manager specifically asks for feedback, you're putting a lot on the line if they're not going to be receptive to it. If you don't think your feedback will be used to any benefit, keep it to yourself.In some cases, managers also say they're looking for feedback, but they're really just looking for confirmation of their decisions rather than real feedback.
Talk to other co-workers if you're unsure how to respond when your manager requests feedback.

"
"
Meet your boss one on one.,
Prepare for the conversation.,
Demonstrate a constructive motive.,
Include positive feedback to balance the negative.,
Speak from your own perspective.,
Keep the issue private.",How to Give Feedback to Your Manager2," Particularly if you want to pass on critical or negative feedback, this should be done in private. When you schedule a private meeting, let your manager know what you want to talk about.For example, you might say ""Can I schedule a time this week to meet with you privately? I just want to discuss some inefficiencies I've noticed in the handling of TPS Reports.""
Letting your manager know what you want to talk about gives them a chance to prepare for the discussion and read up on the issue, if necessary. Scheduling a meeting also shows them that you respect their time.

, An outline will keep you on track during the discussion, and help ensure that you've said everything you feel you need to say. It can help you keep focus if you get nervous talking to your boss.Write down the facts of the situation you want to talk about, including a brief description. Depending on the type of feedback you're offering, you also may want to describe your associated tasks.
For example, if you want to convey to your manager that they are not communicating your responsibilities well, you might write ""It was my understanding that my job was to deliver the reports to my direct report on Monday. Now I am told that I am supposed to submit them to another office as well, on the previous Friday.""

, Your manager will be less receptive to your feedback if they perceive that you're just trying to poke at them or take them down a notch. Even if your criticism is personal, remain focused on how your suggestion would improve the workplace or the business.The balance can be tricky if your complaint concerns a personal habit or style of your manager. Here, focus on alternatives that would be easy to adopt and would make a significant difference.

, Most people respond better to negative feedback when they are also told what they're doing right. Otherwise, they may get defensive. Positive feedback also can help relax your manager and make them more receptive.Positive feedback is especially important if you normally have a tense relationship with your manager. It can have a significant impact if you've never complimented your manager before.
Make sure your positive feedback is honest – try to make it as specific as possible, since specifics carry more weight than generalities. For example, ""I was impressed by your handling of the Graystone account – everyone else had written it off,"" is better than ""You sure know how to keep clients.""

, Rather than making general statements or accusations, frame your feedback in terms of your own personal observations. This allows room for discussion while also emphasizing the limitations of your viewpoint.Your manager is likely to close off and get defensive if you start talking about, for example, what you would do if you were in their shoes. Keep in mind that your manager may be dealing with other factors that you know nothing about.
Avoid mentioning other coworkers unless specifically asked if anyone else agrees with your feedback. You don't want it to seem like everyone was talking about your manager behind their back.

, Unless the matter you want to discuss with your manager is serious, such as a sexual harassment problem, avoid discussing your meeting or your feedback with any of your coworkers.Don't email your notes for the meeting to yourself, or to anyone else. You don't want them to exist on the company servers where someone might read them.
Once the meeting has concluded, shred any notes you have or give them to your manager and allow them to dispose of them as they see fit. This communicates that you're keeping the matter between the two of you and respecting your manager's privacy.

"
"
Avoid getting personal.,
Stay on topic.,
Be open to discussion.,
Ask your manager about their feedback preferences.,
Follow up on the discussion.",How to Give Feedback to Your Manager3," If your manager gets upset, or seems unreceptive to your feedback, it can be tempting to call out perceived faults in your manager's personality. Stick to actions rather than bringing up personal traits that have little bearing on the matter at hand.Think of the situation like any argument. Any chance of a productive discussion is lost once you start insulting each other.

, As you talk to your manager, you may be reminded of other issues you have with their management style. You also may recall other matters that are causing workplace inefficiencies or problems. Leave them for another time.If something seems important, make a mental note to look into it and bring it up on a separate occasion at a later date.
Remaining focused on the issue at hand tells your manager that you respect their time and want to see the company succeed.

, Your manager may have legitimate reasons for doing things a certain way, or they may be dealing with factors you weren't aware of. Speak openly about your concerns and then give them a chance to explain.When your manager is speaking, listen. Don't interrupt or contradict what they're saying. When they've finished, repeat back what they've said so they know what you understand. Allow them to correct any misunderstanding.
When you and your manager come to an agreement on something, repeat that understanding and get your manager's assent that you agree on it. Then move forward from there.

, If your manager completely shuts down and is not willing to listen to or accept any of your feedback, give them the benefit of the doubt. Find out how you approached the situation wrong and what you can do in the future.Treat the entire process as a learning experience. If your manager cuts you off or indicates they don't want to listen to you, you might say: ""I understand that you don't want feedback from me on the TPS Reports. Are there any other areas in which you would welcome my input? I'd like to make more of a contribution to the company.""

, Regardless of the outcome of your meeting, your manager will appreciate a written note from you thanking them for the opportunity to provide feedback to them.If the two of you agreed to any changes, you might mention those and discuss anything you've done to facilitate those changes.
If you were not able to come to any sort of agreement, or your manager was unreceptive to your feedback, you still should send them a short note thanking them for their time.
Close your note by telling your manager how excited or enthusiastic you are about contributing to the company's success. Invite them to solicit your feedback in the future.

Compare the audit to the original policy.,
Meet with an insurance attorney.,
Dispute the audit.",How to Prepare for a Workers Compensation Audit," You shouldn’t volunteer more information than requested.For this reason, you should ask what documents the auditor needs to see and then gather those documents ahead of time.;
, The auditor will probably request payroll records, so get these in order. Generally, you must provide copies of the following:payroll journal and summary (payroll includes salaries, wages, commissions, overtime pay, and bonuses)state unemployment reports
individual earnings records
federal tax reports (941 reports)
your check book
all overtime payments (broken out by employee)

, You’ll probably also need to provide detailed employee records, which you should pull together before the auditor arrives. Find the following:number of employees
hours, days and weeks worked during the year
detailed explanation of job duties for every employee
breakdown based on dollar amounts if an employee works in more than one classification code

, You’ll need to present this information to the auditor, so find it ahead of time. Double check to make sure all numbers are accurate:payments to any subcontractors and independent contractors
materials
casual labor

, Depending on your state, you may be charged workers’ compensation premiums for independent contractors and subcontractors. You’ll want current certificates of insurance for every subcontractor you used during the policy period.


The certificates should state that workers’ compensation insurance is being provided. Some contractors have only general liability coverage without workers’ compensation.In some states, sole proprietors and partners can opt out of the workers’ compensation requirement., You might have one of two kinds of audits: a physical audit or a voluntary audit. You should know ahead of time which you will have:A physical audit involves an auditor contacting you by phone or mail and scheduling an appointment. They must contact you within 60 days of the expiration of your policy. You will provide the auditor with documents. The auditor is working on a deadline—usually thirty days once assigned your audit.
A voluntary audit involves you receiving a form in the mail from your insurance company. You must complete the form and submit it to your insurer. Although the forms are basic, you should call the insurer if you have any questions.

, The audit will go more smoothly if your business designates a primary contact to work with the insurer. Make sure to choose someone who is familiar with the entire business. This person should also be familiar with payroll records.This primary contact should be familiar with any prior audits. They should review the auditor’s worksheets and prior policies so that they are aware of the issues that can arise.

, The auditor might work off the premises. However, if they work in your office, then make a comfortable space for them to work. It should be well-lit and quiet.


Try to get the auditor to work on your premises. This makes sharing information easier, and you can provide as much detailed information as possible. It can be hard to share information when auditors work off-site., This policy was based on an estimate. However, you should review the policy to uncover what was used to calculate your initial policy premiums. Consider the following:Payrolls. Workers compensation rates are typically tied to your payroll. For every hundred dollars, you are charged a rate.
Rate. The rate will be based on the kind of work done. This work will be classified based on a classification system used to determine workers’ comp.
Classification codes. Not all work carries the same likelihood of injury. The auditor will determine what is the governing classification that generates the most payroll. However, some workers are given their own classification, such as clerical and outside sales people.Experience modification factor. After determining the classification, the auditor multiplies the rate by your payroll. However, the auditor can adjust this amount based on your prior workers’ compensation history.

, Look at your website and see if there is any information there that is wrong. Your auditor will be reviewing all publicly available information about your business.You should correct anything that is inaccurate.

, The audit can be stressful because the insurer might drastically increase your premiums. You can make the process go more smoothly by always being friendly and helpful to the auditor.Based on your policy, the auditor probably can request any financial document, such as tax filings. You should provide it promptly and without disagreement.
You would rather the auditor work with the accurate information than guess. When auditors guess, they provide “worst case scenario” information, which likely inflates your premiums.
You can typically expect to pay 25% more when you don’t comply with the auditor., Sometimes auditors make mistakes that benefit the insurance company (and hurt you). You should carefully review the auditor’s work after they finish. You will have to ask the insurer for copies of the auditor’s worksheets.An insurer doesn’t generally offer these worksheets unless you ask.
Avoid signing off on any audit that is incomplete., Sometimes, the audited premiums will be higher than the estimate you received when you bought the policy. You want to make sure any increase is legitimate. Look for the following:Whether the experience modification factor is higher on the audit than on the original policy. It shouldn’t be.
If there are more expensive classification codes on the audit than in the original policy. Sometimes, your business operations change so these classifications will change. However, they generally shouldn’t absent a major change in your operations.
Whether the schedule credit or debit has changed. If so, you might be able to dispute the amount.

, If you have questions, then schedule a consultation with a lawyer. Show them the auditor’s worksheets and your original policy. Your lawyer can decide whether you have grounds for challenging the audit.


You can find an insurance attorney by contacting your state or local bar association and asking for a referral.
You can find your nearest bar association by visiting the American Bar Association’s website: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx. Enter your address.
Call up and schedule a consultation. Make sure to ask how much it will cost.

, Your insurer should tell you how to dispute the audit determination. For example, you might need to submit records to the insurer within a certain amount of time. If you wait too long, then the insurer will probably assume you agree with the audit.Don’t delay. Call up your insurer and complain that you don’t agree with the audit. Ask what you need to provide and the deadline.

If the goals were not met or exceeded, determine what effect outside influences, such as project scope changes, may have had on the issues, and how much responsibility rests with the employee.;
, If there was a reduction in goals since the previous review, determine why. If extra duties were added since the previous review, determine how well those extra duties were carried out.

, During your periodic meetings with the employee over the year, you may have taken notes regarding weekly progress. Review any notes or email correspondence with the employee to gage progress.

, Document specific examples of the employee performing assigned duties and interacting with other employees.

, Dispassionately read the review you have written and be sensitive to the possibility that your own personal feelings may have swayed a fair appraisal. Adjust the review if necessary.

, At the performance management review, the employee should be presented with expectations for the coming year. Keep in mind that these should be long-term goals, if possible. Leave open the possibility that these goals and responsibilities may change during the year, but that changes would be discussed with the employee and noted as modifications on the review form.

, Be prepared to address the changes that should be made to the employee's responsibilities and to discuss performance rewards for the employee, such as pay or position increases. If the employee has areas for improvement, suggest formal or informal methods to help the employee improve his skills or job performance.

, Give the employee at least a 1-week notice for the performance management review. Make sure that the employee understands the nature of the issues to be discussed.

Formally close the review.",How to Prepare a Performance Management Review3," Encourage the employee to provide feedback throughout the process. Be open to explanations given by the employee. It should not become a practice to change a written performance mark, but do so if the employee presents reasons that you find compelling.

, These goals and responsibilities should be discussed through an interactive conversation with the employee. Be sure that the employee understands and commits to the new goals and responsibilities.

, Take this opportunity to thank the employee for her good performance. Mention performance rewards that may be forthcoming, if applicable.

, Tell the employee what formal or informal steps need to be taken to improve performance. Make sure that the employee understands what is required, and understands that the plans are not a punishment for poor performance, but a chance to improve skills and abilities.

Be aware that most maternity leave is unpaid in the U.S. Keep track of your monthly expenses in order to estimate how much you are spending, then make a post-baby budget that adds in things like increased insurance premiums, diapers, and baby formula. This will allow you to determine how much money you need to cover you time away from work., In the United States, you may have guaranteed unpaid leave lasting 12 weeks or more, or even guaranteed paid leave, depending on the state where you work. In all other nations save Lesotho, Swaziland, and Papua New Guinea, you are guaranteed paid maternity leave, typically lasting 3 months.In the U.S., if you work at a company with 50 or more employees, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1983 guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or an adopted child, provided you have worked in the country for over a year.Also check the maternity leave policies in your state. California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island provide 4 to 6 weeks of paid maternity leave. Other states have laws offering disability insurance or requiring maternity leave regardless of the size of the company you work for. Check here for an overview of the applicable laws in your state.
If you belong to a union, it may also offer maternity benefits., Consult the employee manual or talk to someone in HR. Your company may offer paid leave or unpaid leave in excess of that guaranteed by law. According to a 2012 study by the Family and Work Institute, the average company policy allows for 14 weeks of leave, though much of that is typically unpaid.If talking to someone in HR, consider asking:Does the company offer paid maternity leave? For how many weeks?
Does it offer short-term disability insurance? For how many weeks? At what percentage of pay?
How many vacation, personal, or sick days do I have? Are there limitations on how I can use them?
Can I take vacation or sick days in advance (i.e. ones you have not yet accrued)?
Will taking unpaid leave delay any raises or promotions?
Will the company continue to cover my health insurance, or will I need to pay the premiums if on unpaid leave?
Will any of my other benefits be affected?

, Even if there are no official company policies, you’ll want to ask around to find out how other employees have handled their maternity leave.Here are some questions to be sure to ask:How did your boss / the upper level managers respond when you asked about maternity leave?
What did you do to ensure your work responsibilities were taken care of?
How much time did you take? Did you feel it was enough?
How did you transition back? Were you able to arrange a flexible schedule, such as working several days from home?
Is there anything you wish you had done differently?

, You’ll want to be armed with facts and figures so that you can make your case to your manager or the HR department that maternity leave is good for business. Try to find out what companies like yours are doing.Susan Wojcicki, current YouTube CEO and the first woman at Google to take maternity leave, offers some good points on why companies should offer paid leave:A 2011 survey by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that after paid maternity leave became the law in California, 91% of employers experienced increased profits or profit neutrality, while most noted improved productivity and morale.
Paid maternity leave also greatly decreases employee turnover – by 50% with new moms at Google.

, HR departments are usually pretty rigid when it comes to sticking with policy, so you’ll likely have more luck approaching your manager. Start by assuring him or her that you plan to return to work.And instead of framing your request as an exception to the rule, try framing it as an exciting new approach to solve your problem and to attract other qualified candidates., The healthier your company is financially and the better your job performance, the more you can ask for. So don’t ask for extra time if your fellow employees are being fired or if your boss doesn’t like you., As in any negotiations, you must be ready to suggest or accept alternative solutions. Most companies will be more willing to give additional time than additional pay.


Consider asking for a flexible work arrangement, where you ease back into work with several days a week working from home.The days off guaranteed by the FLMA do not have to be continuous. By working 3 days a week, you can stretch the last few weeks of your FLMA time into a month our more.

, Some states offer disability insurance, if not, you can get it through your employer or on your own. In return for monthly premiums, an insurance company will pay a percentage of your salary (usually around 60%) for 6 to 8 weeks after you give birth. Don’t wait until you are pregnant. Many companies require you to hold coverage for 10 months or more before you use it. This is something you need to do as soon as you decide to have a child., This is hard, because you’re life will change dramatically after you have a child, and it may be years before you have another carefree vacation. However, limiting the vacation days you take will mean more time to bond with your newborn. It’s worth it.

, Talk with your company to see if you can take on extra projects and extra hours in order to bank time for maternity leave., Most women in America will have to take unpaid leave, or if they are paid, it will not be their full salary. Here are some tips to help you stretch your maternity leave by saving in the months before you are due:Track your expenses. Try an app that allows you to see how much you spend or to track purchases. Keeping track of where your money is going is a vital first step in cutting expenses.
Cut out recurring expenses that aren’t worth it. Do you really need cable, or can you get by with just NetFlix or HBONow? Are you using your gym enough to justify the cost? How much data do you really need for your cellphone?
Cut out extra expenses. Coffee shops and lunches out are nice, but they can cost a lot of money. Do you really need a $10 lunch out when you could be packing your own lunch for two or three dollars? Can you drop the $4 latte and take your own coffee from home in a travel mug?
Make your savings automatic. Decide how much you need to save per month, and then have the appropriate amount automatically deducted from your paychecks and put in savings.

, Crib, pack n’ play, stroller, car seat, changing table, nursing chair… it can all get really expensive fast. You can save a lot of money by buying these big-ticket items at a discount. Craigslist is a great place to look. Also, many cities and/or neighborhoods have parenting listservs where you can find good deals., People will need to do your work while you’re gone; you should make this as easy as possible for them, without overburdening any one person. The Harvard Business Review suggests you “prepare a list of your core responsibilities, dividing them into tasks that can be assumed by other and those that aren’t so easy to delegate, such as client relationships.”Think about who in your organization might fill each role, and consider hiring someone to cover for you if necessary.

, This involves more than just telling the good news that you’re pregnant. You’ll also need to let them know the additional responsibilities they’ll be taking on. This does not have to be a burden for them. Especially for subordinates, it can be an opportunity to take on new, higher-level responsibilities and to progress their career., You’ll need to let your clients know that you will be stepping away, and also introduce them to the person who will be taking over for you in your absence. If you serve as the primary contact for anyone else – suppliers if you’re a restaurant manager, for instance – you’ll need to let them know your plans, too.

, The more you can tie-up before you leave, the less you will have to stress about while gone, and the easier the transition will be for your coworkers., It can be very hard to step right in after 3 months away if you have not kept in touch. You’re company should know that you will not always be available, but do plan to check in regularly by email or via a short, weekly scheduled call.

, If you are going to be heading back to full-time work, there is a good chance you will need to enroll your child in daycare or to find a nanny. You don’t have to wait until your child is born to start looking.Daycare – Ask for friend’s recommendations. Look for a daycare that is near your home or work, and which offers flexible pick-up and drop-off times. Visit and talk to the staff about their philosophies on childcare and discipline.
Nanny – Nannies are more expensive, but they also offer more flexibility for working parents. To cut the cost, consider a nanny-share. These work best if the children are about the same age and the parents have similar child-raising philosophies, so choose people you know, or be sure to interview both the nanny and the parents you will be sharing with.
Partner - Your partner’s company may have better leave policies than your own. If your partner can get paid leave, then consider having him or her stay home with the baby while you transition back to work. Knowing your partner is home with the baby can make for a much less stressful transition than sending your child to daycare.

, Don’t forget the little things. It’s best to take any personal belongings you treasure home, as you can’t be certain they won’t be disturbed. In some cases, another worker might even be using your desk when you’re gone, so be sure to also remove personal files like performance reviews. And don’t forget to set out-of-office messages that tell the caller or emailer who they can contact in your absence.

Create you table of contents after you finish your portfolio but include the list at the front of your other material.
You do not need to list page numbers if you do not include them in your portfolio, but if you do decide to number the pages in your portfolio, list those numbers in your table of contents.;
, It's always wise to have a traditional résumé on hand in case someone requests it instead of your portfolio. Within the portfolio itself, a standard one to two page résumé can act as a quick summary or abstract of what lies ahead.

List your basic career or academic goal.
List your academic credentials, including any degrees or certificates.
Describe your work experience.

Also list anything you learned, officially or unofficially, that indicates the use or existence of the skill in question.

, Note that the types of samples you include will vary based on the nature of your portfolio and field of interest.


For graphic arts and related fields, you will need to include visual photographs of your work.
For writing and related fields, you will need to include text samples.
You can include print samples, DVDs, videos, and other multimedia examples when appropriate.

, Include photocopies of any positive remarks or recommendations received from past sources related to your field.


You can include recommendations from customers, clients, employers, co-workers, professors, or reviewers.
Employer evaluations can also be included, especially if they are notably favorable.

, Include a list of any awards, honors, or scholarships you received within your field.


If you received certificates for any such awards, include photocopies in your portfolio as proof.
If you do not have certificates for your awards, simply list the name of the award, when you won it, and why you won it or what the award was issued for.

, If you took part in any conferences or workshops within the field, list them on a separate page. Include when the conference took place, where, and the organization that sponsored it.


Make special note of any conferences or conventions you presented at.
Also list any that you merely attended.

, Your academic credentials usually expand upon the knowledge gained during your highest level of education.


List any degrees, licenses, and certifications.
Also provide an official transcript, if possible, or a list of relevant courses.

, If any articles have been written about your accomplishments, include copies of those clippings in your portfolio.


National journals and large newspapers are the most impressive sources, but you should still include articles written by local news sources, academic institutes, and Internet sources.

, If you were in the military, provide a record of your service.


Include information about any awards, badges, or ranks you earned during your time in the military.

, List professional and academic sources who would be willing to promote your work and skills if asked.


Choose wisely and ask permission from each source before listing him or her as a reference.
Include full names, job positions, e-mail addresses, mailing addresses, and phone numbers. Also briefly state how that reference is connected to you.
Limit your references to a single page and list between three to five people.

, Instead of overwhelming the portfolio by including a full listing of your past work, only include 15 to 20 samples of your highest quality pieces.


Begin with any samples required by the organization you are sending your portfolio to. For instance, if a potential client wants to see work samples of advertisements geared for the music industry, include any examples you have of that before including additional examples.
Also include a few samples loosely related to the field that you are most proud of, even if they do not match the exact requirements requested.
Vary your sample types as appropriate. If you are submitting a writing portfolio, you only need to include writing samples. Those samples can include a range of genres, though, from journalism articles to blog posts or short stories.

, Your original works are too valuable to risk losing as your portfolio gets passed around. Take photographs of three-dimensional works and two-dimensional works and photocopy any writing samples.


Use 35-mm film or high-quality digital prints.
Show your work in the best lighting and from multiple angles.
If including an article published in a magazine, newspaper, or journal, photocopy the volume's front cover and table of contents as well as your article.

,


For print copies of your portfolio, you should slide the DVD samples into a CD pocket and attach the pocket to your portfolio binder.

, One way to make your portfolio stand out is to have an appropriate design.Keep things professional. Avoid “cute” or “cool” clip art and other unnecessary add-ons. These will only distract others viewing your portfolio.
A good design does not need to be flashy. On the contrary, it should be fairly simple and straightforward. Include headings on each page and maintain the same text font, sizing, and coloring throughout. The keys to a good design are accessibility and consistency.

, A good portfolio must be easy to navigate. An easy-to-navigate portfolio will encourage the observer to continue reading through it, but a disorganized portfolio will discourage anyone from giving it the time to sort through.


For print copies, organize your portfolio in a three-ring binder and place labeled dividers in between each different section.
For digital slideshow copies, include a title on each slide to indicate which section the information belongs to.
For websites and blogs, separate each section by giving it its own separate webpage.

, Before you send your portfolio out, ask a professional to review it for you and offer any guidelines about areas that need improvement.


You can ask academic advisers, trusted employers, or acquaintances in the same field.
Alternatively, you can also try to locate career centers and workshops in your community for help. Check with your local library, town hall, or local churches for free or cheap career services.

, A print copy of your portfolio is essential, but digital copies can be helpful, too.


Digital copies in the form of websites and blogs are especially helpful. You can send prospective employers, clients, or customers a link to your online portfolio along with your initial cover letter.
Additionally, having your portfolio in a fixed location online will allow potential employers and clients to find you even without you seeking them out first.

, While there are many different types of careers and specific portfolio elements that go along with each field, in general, a career portfolio should be based around a showcase of work within your field of choice.

, When building a portfolio as an artist, you need to determine which pieces of artwork best show your range of skills.



Build a graphic design portfolio. When creating a portfolio with graphic design in mind, only include samples of graphic design work.

Construct a photography portfolio. Search through your collection of photographs to build a portfolio of photographs illustrating meaningful content and ideal aesthetics.

Gear your portfolio toward art school. If you decide to put together an art portfolio for the purpose of getting into art school, you will need to put together a range of work that demonstrates the skills the art school will want to see.

, In your culinary portfolio, include pictures of yourself at work, photos of your food, copies of menus you designed, and copies of recipes you created.

, A modeling portfolio should contain various headshots of you looking your best.



Build a male model portfolio by studying poses used by other male models.

Do a baby model portfolio by taking professional photos in a variety of poses and outfits. Continually update the portfolio as your baby ages.

, This portfolio should include headshots as well as a detailed listing of your acting credentials and experience, along with a list of works you performed in and reviews you received.

, A fashion portfolio should include photos and sketches of your work as well as swatches from fabrics you've used.

, A writing portfolio should include samples of your writing that demonstrate both your range as a writer as well as any fields of writing you specialize in.

Keep track of comp time.,
Calculate the comp time.,
Allow employees to take time off.,
Cash out employee comp time.",How to Pay Compensatory Time," Public employers may offer compensatory time instead of overtime pay.The rules are different if you are a private employer.


Generally, all employees of a private business must be paid overtime pay instead of comp time unless the employee is exempt from the overtime rules.Public employers can offer comp time in the following situations:a union representative arranges an agreement allowing comp time
the employer and employee agree to comp time before the employee begins working extra hours

;
, Federal law requires that most employees be paid overtime if they work more than 40 hours in a week.However, the law also exempts certain employees from the overtime law. If an employee has been exempted, then you can offer comp time instead of overtime pay.


Salaried employees are often exempted from overtime rules if they perform certain executive, administrative, or professional job duties. The employee must be paid at least $455 a week and her duties must be like those typical of an executive, administrator, or professional.Computer professionals paid at least $27.63 an hour are also exempt from federal overtime laws.Employees who work at seasonal and recreational establishments are also exempt., If you employ “exempt” employees, then federal overtime laws do not apply to those workers. However, your state might have created wage laws which will apply.


To find your state’s laws, you can search the Internet for “your state” and “wage law.” You may also want to contact your state’s Department of Labor and ask to see applicable wage regulations.

, You need to be careful that you don’t offer comp time when it isn’t allowed. You could face an employee lawsuit and be investigated by your state or federal government.For this reason, you should meet with an employment or labor lawyer and discuss how to pay comp time legally.


If you don’t have a lawyer on the payroll, then you should try to get a referral. You can ask other businesses in your community if they would recommend their attorney. If you have no referrals, then you can contact your state’s bar association and ask for a referral.
Call and schedule a consultation. At the consultation, you can have the lawyer advise you about whether comp time is appropriate.
You should also think about getting a lawyer on retainer. When you hire a lawyer on retainer, you pay a small fee each month. In exchange, the lawyer is available to provide legal help whenever a legal problem arises., Your state may require that you get the written consent of employees in order to offer compensatory time. Be sure to keep the signed consent form on file., You can be sued if you shortchange your employees of comp time earned. Accordingly, you need to make sure that you accurately track the comp hours your employees earn.


Make sure that you review each employee’s timesheet and check to see whether comp time has been earned for that time period.
Also note accrued comp hours on the employee’s pay stub., Generally, a non-exempt public employee earns time and a half for each extra hour worked.For example, a public employee who works 42 hours will get three hours of comp time.


Things are different for “exempt” employees. Federal law does not dictate how much comp time you must give or when you must give it. (In fact, you don’t have to give any comp time). After all, the employee is exempt from the federal overtime rules.However, your state may set limits.
Another exception exists if the public employee’s regular workweek is less than 40 hours. In this situation, any hours worked up to 40 can be compensated hour for hour. For example, if an employee’s standard workweek is 32 hours, then she can earn six hours of comp time if she works 38 hours in a week., You must also comply with the law and let employees take comp time when they request it. Generally, you should allow the employee to take the time off unless doing so would unduly disrupt the workplace.There are maximum amounts of comp time that an employee can accrue. For example, most employees can accrue no more than 240 hours of comp time.If the employee has maxed out his or her comp time, then you must pay overtime for any excess hours worked., You might have to pay the employee for comp time accrued if he or she doesn’t take the time off after a certain amount of time. Also, some states require that you make payment if the employee requests it.Generally, you will have to pay out comp time at the same rate at which it was earned.For example, if an employee earned $15.00 an hour when she earned 20 hours of comp time, then she must be paid $300.00 for those 20 hours.
You also need to pay comp time when the employee leaves your employment.

Get the offer in writing.",How to Negotiate Compensation," Effective negotiation requires that you know the market rate for the job that you are applying for. This means researching what people in comparable positions make in your market. You can locate this information in several ways.


Ask co-workers. First, you can talk to anyone at your company who works in the position you are interviewing for. Although many co-workers might not like to talk about their salaries, you could still ask. When you are interviewing for a new job at your current employer, your co-workers remain your best source of information.
Research salaries at PayScale or Glassdoor. These websites collect salary information for various companies, in particular larger national firms. They publish average salaries for various job titles.
Find salaries of comparable companies. If you can’t find salary information specific to the company you are interviewing with, then you should find salary ranges for companies of comparable size. Make sure the company is in the same region or state, as compensation can differ significantly according to region. You can find this information by looking on Glassdoor or PayScale or by performing an Internet search.
Search online for government information. If you are interviewing for a government job, then the Internet often contains salary and benefits information. You can find compensation information for the federal government and for states by doing a web search.;
, To be an effective negotiator, you need to settle on two numbers: your ideal salary (the top range) and the least amount you would settle for (the bottom range). You then negotiate with an eye toward the first number. But you walk away from the negotiations if the employer cannot meet the second number.


Give sufficient thought to your salary range and avoid setting the range too low. According to researchers, women in particular tend to undervalue their worth.To avoid this problem, look at the standard salary ranges in the field. Then consider what skill or unique experiences you have that will increase your value to the company.

, Be prepared to back up your compensation demands with reasons why you are worth that amount. Keep the reasons short, so that you can easily remember and repeat them. Write them down and memorize them before going into compensation negotiations.


In particular, point to your experience and what is unique about it. If you have particular skills (language skills, computer skills, etc.) that are not common in the industry, then you should be sure to highlight those.

, Negotiating might feel unnatural to you. Indeed, many people would rather avoid it entirely. To become comfortable, you should practice with a friend. The friend can pretend to be the employer.


You should prepare for both “hard-style” and “soft-style” negotiators since either present problems to the novice negotiator. Have your friend adopt both roles so that you gain experience handling each personality type.
A “hard-style” negotiator likes to say, “No.” To negotiate effectively, you need to avoid getting rattled. Instead, you should press your compensation demands, justifying them and maintaining an upbeat attitude.
By contrast, the “soft-style” negotiator comes across as agreeable.These negotiators create problems because people often focus on getting the negotiator to like them. Instead, you must focus on the negotiation and on what’s best for you.
Watch out for soft-style negotiators who you already know, e.g., someone in a different department at your company. You should focus on getting a compensation package appropriate to your skills and experience instead of maintaining a friendship with the negotiator., When you are interviewing for a job, try to postpone any discussion of salary for as long as possible. Experts believe that it is important to first make prospective employers fall in love with you before they find out how much they have to pay in order to hire you.


If the interviewer asks about salary requirements, be prepared to deflect. Try to turn the conversation around to something else. For example, you could say, “Before talking about salary, can I hear a little more about…”Ideally, you will wait until you have the job offer before discussing compensation. Sometimes, though, employers require that applicants list their minimum salary in a cover letter. Always express your preferred salary as a range, e.g., $30,000-40,000.A range is better than a definite number.
You might discover later that your salary range is too low. In that case, you can adjust it during the negotiations. For example, explain that you didn’t understand all of the job responsibilities when you came up with the initial figure. Now that you understand the full requirements, you think the salary range should be higher., By waiting, you can avoid making a low initial offer. If the employer asks you to give a number, you can deflect by doing one of the following:ask what the typical compensation range is for others in the same position at the company
ask how much has been budgeted for the position
say you’ll consider any reasonable offer and that they have better information as to what is reasonable

, Once the employer makes an initial offer, you should always counter-offer. Resist the urge to accept the first number. The employer expects you to negotiate. Accordingly, their initial offer should leave room for them to go higher.You can counter-offer with your ideal amount. For example, if your ideal is $55,000 but the initial offer is for $45,000, then ask for $55,000. The employer may or may not accept it, but you will not get to $55,000 unless you put the number out on the table.

, Be prepared to justify your counter-offer, especially if you are dealing with a “hard-style” negotiator. For example, you could inform the negotiator that you helped your current employer start two new programs which you helped oversee. You could say, “Thank you for the offer. I’d love to work for you. But given record of performance, I was expecting something around $55,000.”Speak plainly. You can’t be hesitant when you negotiate. If you want more money, then ask for it. One thing to avoid is asking for more money but justifying it by talking about your expenses. For example, you should never say, “Well, I just took out a second mortgage, so I could use more money.”Instead, you can say, “I need more than that.”

, You should negotiate with confidence. Since you have done your homework, you know that what you are asking for is not unreasonable. If the employer can’t meet even your low number, then you should be prepared to pass on the job. However, you should never issue ultimatums.For example, you should never say, “This is my final offer!” Instead, say, “I need at least $55,000 to make the change in jobs work for me.”
Always be respectful.Imagine that you have already been hired by the company and are negotiating on their behalf. You don’t want the way you comport yourself to discourage the employer from hiring you.

, Your total compensation embraces more than salary. It can be easy to forget about the other benefits as you throw numbers back and forth. You will probably negotiate salary first, but you should always remember to negotiate the remainder of your compensation package:any bonus (annual, quarterly, or other)
stock options or units
pension or 401k contributions
health and wellness benefits, such as medical, dental, and vision
insurance programs (basic life, accidental death, disability)
educational reimbursement programs
other perks, such as gym memberships, cell phone service, transportation reimbursement, Internet, etc.

, If you come to a tentative agreement on salary, write down the number on a notepad. As you move onto other parts of the compensation package, you might forget what the salary offer was.


There is often an element of trade-off involved in negotiating compensation packages. For example, you might think the salary is a little low, but you will be offered vacation days than you had hoped for. In this situation, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower salary.
So that you do not forget all of the elements of the compensation package, write them down as soon as you come to a tentative agreement. Refer to the list as you discuss the remaining parts of the compensation package.

, Effective negotiation requires understanding that the negotiation isn’t personal. It’s a business transaction.

If you are upset about a low initial offer, try not to be. You don’t know everything about the company’s finances; maybe the company wants to offer more but can’t. A salary offer that is less than what you would hope for is not a judgment on you personally.

Similarly, don’t be offended if the employer resists your counter-offer or comes back with another offer.

, After the employer has made a final offer, you should ask for a few days to consider it. Don’t accept it immediately or reject it immediately. Instead, take the time to get some distance and consider the offer objectively.


Most employers should give you up to a week to consider the offer., Once you have agreed to a compensation package, you should ask the employer to put everything in writing. The employer should be happy to do so.

If the employer resists, then reconsider working for this company. It is standard business practice to reduce contract offers to writing.

Equip your primary work environment with everything you'll need for optimum productivity.,
Utilize user-friendly technologies designed especially for the mobile office.,
Set clear expectations on accessibility.,
Manage your time effectively.",How to Organize a Mobile Office," While out of the company's main building, you may find yourself setting up in a variety of places: home office, car, coffee shop, or hotel room. Your location will determine many of the technologies and systems you will need.


Keep frequently used items at hand when deciding how to organize a mobile office so you do not have to search for them. These items could include paper, pens, paperclips, memory sticks, or a three-hole punch.
Rent or pay for services that you only use occasionally, such as copying or color printing. This allows you to keep a low overhead, increasing your profit.;
, Then provide the necessary equipment and support for you and the team to use this technology well. Examples include laptop computers, tablets, portable printers, chargers, and mini power strips.


Find software applications for devices you already use, such as your smartphone or tablet. Since you are familiar with your device, it will be easier to take the next step as you go mobile.
Explore cloud-based products that allow collaboration. Even when team members are in different locations, they can still work together on projects through virtual conferencing or document management systems.

, Mobile devices enable clients and coworkers to reach you anytime, anywhere. However, by setting guidelines, you can provide a healthy work environment and model healthy boundaries to the rest of your team.


Communicate your expected work hours for the week with your team. Better yet, set regular hours so that your colleagues as well as your clients know when they can reach you in your mobile office.
Disconnect from your phone and communication devices when you are ""off hours"" so you can separate work and your personal life. Almost all emails and voice mails can wait until the following day for you to answer them.

, A mobile office allows for greater flexibility in your schedule, but it also challenges you to be responsible with your time, and not let it impede on your personal life. You may also have to be persistent about fighting distractions especially if you are working from home; work to prevent yourself from taking care of personal or household matters during work hours.


As in any office setting, use a calendar or planner to organize your time. Missing an important appointment, being late, or double-booking yourself causes unnecessary stress in your life and is unprofessional. By using a calendar, you remember meetings with important clients and can decide what projects you will work on each day.
Set aside an hour every day to handle tasks like responding to email and voice mail, following up with colleagues or clients, and charting your progress on larger projects.
Handle information one time. For example, once you read an email, take action by responding, filing, or deleting it. Refuse to let messages pile up in your inbox.

Familiarize yourself with the characteristics of a good manager.,
Read books on management.,
Find a mentor.,
Volunteer to stand in as a project manager at your current job.,
Take management training seminars.,
Attend school to learn how to be a manager.",How to Gain Management Skills," In order to be a manager, you will need to develop each of these areas:


Effective communication skills involve expressing your points in a way that others can understand, as well as listening to others in a way that allows you an optimal understanding of what is being said.
An aptitude for seeking and recognizing the truth is a necessary part of good management skills. That is because managers are in a position of power, and it is only natural that those working under you may sometimes tell you only what you want to hear.
Empathy is necessary to understanding those you manage, as well as your customers.
To be a manager, you must know how to use persuasion to affect outcomes both in the workplace and in the consumer market.
Leadership is almost synonymous with management, and is an integral part of any management training program. To be a manager, you must be able to guide others in a way that brings out their best. You must also be able to absorb stress in a way to shield employees from responsibilities that are not theirs, so that you can show them, by example, how to handle tasks.
Managers must be able to resolve issues in a way that has the least negative impact on coworkers and customers, and they must be able to accept responsibility for any problems that arise, without deflecting or transferring blame to others.
Understand that there is a difference between managing people and managing a project, and that you are responsible for doing both.
Organizational and administrative skills enable you to develop budgets, track payroll, monitor employee performance, develop business strategies and much more.;
, Go to the library, or search the Internet, in order to find texts that can guide you on the principles and applications of management skills.

, Develop a relationship with a manager that you respect and aspire to be like, and ask for advice and guidance. You may even opt to place an ad in the local or Internet classifieds section to recruit a mentor who can give you personalized management training.

, Managing a specific project, as opposed to moving into a permanent supervisory position, is a great way to gain management skills while maintaining a safety net during the process.

, An online search for management seminars will return a multitude of both on-site and webinar-style management training seminars.

, You may pursue an associates, bachelors or masters degree in business management from any college or university that offers such a program.

Familiarize yourself with the different styles of leadership.,
Evaluate your needs.,
Find an appropriate balance between consideration and structure.",How to Find the Right Management Style," There are several basic styles you may choose from, based on the distribution of power. You should ideally combine certain aspects of 2 or more styles in order to tailor your management style to your specific circumstances.


Democratic/participative/consultative management. This managerial style relies on the participation and input of every one of your team members, but allows for the manager to withhold major decision-making and delegating responsibilities. When you employ democratic management, you encourage your employees to think for themselves, act on their own behalf and be accountable for their job duties. This promotes autonomy in the workplace, and is conducive to high employee morale and productivity.
Autocratic/authoritarian management. This leadership style is also called authoritarian and, as the name suggests, puts the majority of power and control in the hands of the manager. In an autocratic style of management, the leader makes all of the decisions without any consultation to the employees. This dynamic is useful in situations where you know more than the team members about the project at hand and must delegate and oversee employees' job duties due to strict time restraints. However, an autocratic management style can be stifling if overused.
Delegative/laissez-faire/free reign management. This method of management relies on the competency of each and every team member, as it implies little to no managerial involvement and complete employee autonomy. Delegative management is ideal when an efficient and knowledgeable team has already been established and proven to work together effectively toward the accomplishment of project tasks. It is important with this style that you know you are still responsible for the end product, and for being accountable to your employees to help them accomplish their tasks.
Paternal Management. This is similar to autocratic management in that the bulk of power is in the hands of management, except that it provides for some consultation with team members. The idea of paternal leadership is to supply employees with the resources needed in order to get the job done, but to limit decision-making abilities in favor of the manager.;
, As a manager, it is important that you carefully consider all of the circumstances surrounding your team and the project at hand in order to figure out how to best manage your employees.


Team members. Take into account the length of time your employees have been working together and for your company. Assess their knowledge, skill set, competency and reliability. The more qualified your team members are, the more responsibility you can give them.
Manager/employee dynamic. Consider how you work with your team members. You may work directly with them on projects, or work from a separate office, where you are not on as familiar a level with them. Your personal relationship with employees plays a part in determining the effectiveness of the different styles of management.
Personality type. As a manager, your personality type is important to the managerial style you will be comfortable with. If you are a dominant personality, then you might do best leading with an autocratic or paternal style. If you enjoy being a team player, then you might be well-suited for the democratic or delegated styles. Gauge the amount of power you are comfortable sharing and the amount of control you prefer to have over project management in order to determine the power balance, and corresponding style of management, that is a good fit for you.
Project specifics. Take into account all of the factors involved in accomplishing the necessary tasks and determine the most productive distribution of responsibility and power. If you have strict time constraints, are working with a team of inexperienced employees and/or must delegate the use of limited available resources, then you may need to assume a strong authoritarian or paternal leadership role in order to compensate for those factors. On the other hand, if your team is well-equipped to handle the job, there are substantial resources and/or the task calls for teamwork, a delegative or democratic approach may be more suitable.
Company size. If your company is large and you are responsible for managing a large number of people, then it may be difficult to coordinate employee tasks and productivity from a delegative standpoint. However, if you are working with a relatively small team, it may be feasible to place a majority of the responsibility in their hands, as it will be easier for you to oversee productivity from a distance.

, Your ideal leadership style should combine these traits in a ratio that is appropriate to the team composition and the project at hand.


Consideration is the amount of importance placed on the needs of your employees, and involves things like team building and maintaining employee morale.
Structure focuses solely on accomplishing tasks, and involves delegating and managing team member responsibilities.

Develop your first impression into a lasting impression.",How to Make a Good Impression at Work," Many jobs today allow their employees to dress in what is commonly called “business casual” and involves khakis, slacks or skirts and collared shirts or blouses. However, some offices may require a more formal dress code and working on a construction site would likely have very different requirements.Take note of what people are wearing during your interviews. There’s no better way to know what is considered appropriate work attire than to see what employees are currently wearing.
Always err on the formal side when starting a new job. It’s better to appear to be overdressed than too casual.;
, While the dress code in your new office may be a little relaxed, it's best to begin your first day with a fairly conservative appearance. Once you get to know the environment, you may be able to relax on some facets of office attire and presentation, but wait until you're sure.


Stick to relatively conservative hair styles, makeup, and jewelry until you know the office culture.
Take cues from your coworkers on what the acceptable limits of office appearances are.
Always check the employee handbook for rules about employee appearance.

, There are many kinds of professional footwear on the market and you should make sure to match your shoes to the work you will be doing. Your shoes should appear professional and in keeping with the style of dress that is expected in the workplace (like wearing dress shoes with a suit or boots with work pants on a construction site).Make sure your shoes are comfortable, especially if you will be on your feet a lot. While the comfort of your shoes won’t directly create an impression, focusing on how bad your feet hurt will make it difficult to focus on other more important things.
Check the employee handbook to make sure there are no limitations on things like heel height for women or a requirement to wear non-skid shoes in certain environments.

, Now that your outfit and shoes are perfect, you need to make sure your grooming matches. Personal hygiene can have a dramatic effect on first impressions and no outfit can compensate for bad body odor.Get a fresh haircut before your first day on a new job.
Make sure to shower and wear deodorant.
Trim your fingernails and ensure you don’t wear makeup or nail polish that is inappropriate for a professional environment.

, Having good manners is a great way to make a solid first impression with anyone, and that includes people in your workplace. Having good manners can demonstrate your maturity while endearing you to your new coworkers.Be on time to work and for meetings.
Say please and thank you when appropriate.
Do not tell off color jokes or make inappropriate comments.
Showing common courtesy to others is a great way to begin conversations with new coworkers. Offer a polite greeting or hold open doors for people and you may find you are making friends already.

, The human resources department at your new job should provide you with an employee handbook or guidelines about policies and procedures in your new job. Keep those in mind and keep an eye out for unofficial office policies to make sure you follow them as well.Unofficial policies include general office procedures that may not be listed in formal documents. Things like replacing the printer paper if you were the last to use it or taking personal calls outside are examples of policies that may be unofficial but are generally followed by your coworkers.
Official policies may include wearing jeans on Fridays or scheduled break times.

, You will be spending a great deal of time with your coworkers, so it makes sense to get to know them, but it can also benefit the way your coworkers perceive you. Be friendly and spark up some conversations with your new team.Making an effort to get to know your coworker’s names will make them more apt to remember yours and demonstrates that you are interested in getting to know them.
Talking to you coworkers can demonstrate that you are a team player early.
Establish relationships with your coworkers, but be mindful of who you spend too much time with. You don’t want to be associated with hanging out with the office gossip or slacker before you have a chance to establish yourself.

, Active listening is a way to interact with other people that demonstrates that you find what they are saying is important and valuable. It’s a great way to improve mutual understanding as well as establish or solidify professional relationships.Focus your attention on who’s speaking and provide them with non-verbal acknowledgements that you are listening like nodding your head.
Make eye contact with the person speaking, but don’t maintain it for too long.
Repeat the speaker’s points to them in your own words to demonstrate that you were paying attention and understand what was said.

, You may be facing difficulties at home that make it difficult to focus while at work. While it’s understandable that you may struggle with outside issues from time to time, do your best to check your problems at the door and focus on the job and maintaining your professional relationships while you’re on the clock.Discussing your home problems could reveal aspects of yourself to coworkers that doesn’t reflect the caliber of employee you truly are. For instance, you may be worried about your personal debt, but you don’t want your coworkers to think you may not be able to stay within budget on work projects.
If something at home is upsetting you, it could affect how you interact with people in the workplace. Try to enter the workplace with a fresh state of mind and positive outlook.

, A majority of the communication we do throughout the day is actually non-verbal. You are saying things to your new coworkers in the way you walk, stand, and position yourself as you speak, so be sure you’re sending the right messages.Avoid standing with your arms crossed, as it suggests a defensive attitude.Use good posture and a friendly expression to demonstrate your confidence.
Smile regularly and nod as you listen to people speak.

, No one expects you to immediately understand all the elements of a new job right away, but they may be too busy to realize that you need help. Don’t be embarrassed to ask someone to explain something to you; not only does it demonstrate that you care about the work you are doing, but it might even make the person you ask like you more.It’s better to ask for help than to do something the wrong way. Save you and your coworkers time by asking for clarification and doing things right the first time.
Benjamin Franklin famously won over people that didn’t like him by asking for favors. Asking for a favor can pacify someone that sees you as a rival and make them see you in a more positive light., You may find yourself without much to do on your first day at work. After filling out human resources documents and completing orientation there may be time leftover that your supervisor or manager hasn’t accounted for. Don’t let that time, or any time in your new job, go to waste.Volunteer to help others with things so you can learn about the job and get to know your coworkers.
Be proactive and complete tasks you know you will be asked to complete later.
Be comfortable with the idea of doing things that might make you uncomfortable. Doing new things is the only way to get good at them.

, Demonstrating an understanding of what the company does and how it works on your first day shows that you are well prepared and care about the job. Research the company you will be working for and read about their operations and policies on their website if you can.

Look for the company in the news to see if there are any developing or recent stories that involve the company.
Peruse press releases the company posts on its website.

, Shining a spotlight on the help others have provided or the hard work they’ve done goes far to demonstrate your confidence and that you are a team player. If someone goes out of their way to assist you, mention it to the group or your supervisor in conversation.Pointing out the achievements of others may strengthen your relationship with them.
Demonstrating that you are willing to share the spotlight shows your employers and coworkers that you aren’t selfish.

, Now that you have established yourself as a valuable new member of your team, it's up to you to live up to the expectations that you've set for yourself. Keep up your good habits to establish a long lasting impression as a team player and asset to the organization.Be a hard worker, but be modest about your successes and achievements.
Demonstrate a willingness to help others and be a part of the team.
Be honest about mistakes and upbeat about every situation.
Be ambitious and action oriented; don't be afraid to try new things.

Don't review personality.,
Try secret callers.",How to Evaluate an Administrative Assistant," The first step is to determine what exactly the duties of the administrative assistant are. You can't evaluate the person until you know what you are evaluating them on.


For instance, some standard responsibilities include answering phones, greeting people, managing equipment, relaying messages and mail, proofing letters and publications, organizing files and documents, coordinating events, and maintaining office supplies.
Other responsibilities could be learning the industry jargon, being able to manage the office schedule well, and being available to run errands as needed.;
, Evaluation criteria do not need to be duty-specific. For instance, you could also list qualities you expect from the person such as professional, organized, available, and positive attitude.Some qualities that might be specific to administrative assistants include punctual, professional in greeting customers, strong communicator, diplomatic, able to manage time well, adaptable, and discreet., Under each duty, responsibility, or quality, write out what is expected to achieve a high mark for performance. You can also write out what would count against this trait.


For instance, under ""professional,"" you could write ""dresses in business casual,"" ""greets customers politely and promptly,"" ""maintains a neat area for entering customers,"" while things that would count against it include ""not dressing in business casual,"" ""being rude to customers,"" or ""leaving entrance area messy.""

, For instance, you can have a 1 to 10 grading system, where 10 is outstanding and anywhere below 4 is not acceptable. Leave a place below each trait where the reviewer can write out a justification for the score.

, Your employee cannot be expected to guess at what you want. When you hire an employee on, you should have a job description that lays out these expectations. You can include the evaluation form so your administrative assistant knows exactly what is ahead.In addition, discuss how meeting your prescribed rubric will affect his or her place in the company. Maybe you will give bonuses to employees who do well, or you will use the rubric to decide who advances. In turn, maybe employees who score badly will be put on probation until their work improves, and if they get bad reviews for three evaluations in a row, they will be fired., For an office assistant, realistic goals may be learning a new software system or incorporating new tasks, such as scheduling. It could also mean learning a new skill, such as basic web maintenance.


It can be helpful to sit down with your administrative assistant to discuss what goals he or she has in mind, as well, as the person may already be pursuing certain professional interests.

, Break the big tasks down into smaller goals. For instance, if you want your administrative assistant to learn basic web maintenance, you could have smaller goals for the year, such as take a class (12 weeks), practice skills (12 weeks), learn basic system from web tech (12 weeks), and begin maintenance of website., If you did not sit down with your employee to decide on goals, you should communicate what you expect of the person. A written document is good because it provides a permanent record of what you would like to see, but you should also go over the goals with the person., At the next performance review, include the goals from last year. Evaluate whether the person met or failed the goals, and whether it was because he or she failed to perform adequately. In other words, don't punish the person if he or she couldn't meet the goals because of outside circumstances, such as no class was available in the given time period., Once an administrative assistant has achieved certain goals, it's time to decide how to best put those to use. Use the performance evaluation to guide new goals for the next year, based on what the person learned in the previous year.

, Maybe you want to review you administrative assistant annually. However, you may decide that quarterly review works better, as you can continue to touch base with him or her. Going longer periods gives your employees longer to work towards goals, but reviewing at closer intervals means you touch base with them more often on their performance. In turn, they can make adjustments throughout the year.Some companies have one big performance reviews each year, supplemented by smaller reviews throughout the year.

, If your administrative assistant works for more than one person, maybe you want each person to fill out a form and provide feedback. If your administrative assistant just works for you, then you should be the reviewer.

, Maybe you just want to provide feedback in a written form. In turn, maybe you want to discuss the review in a one-on-one meeting with your administrative assistant. Another alternative is having a small meeting with several other supervisors.

, That is, you can't review an employee once a year without notes to back you up. You simply can't rely on memory. Throughout the year, make notes on your administrative assistant's performance on at least a weekly basis with specific details.For instance, you should write, ""Three customers complimented X employee today. They said she was doing a good job helping with their problem"" not ""X did a good job today."" Or you could write ""X was disorganized this week. She lost three important files. She has promised to do better"" not ""X lacks organizational skills.""

, When review time comes around, use your notes to fill in your evaluation form. Add in details to justify each score you give. Also, evaluate whether your administrative assistant has met the required goals.

, Once you have reviewed your employee, present the information in the format you've decided on. Even if you meet with the employee, you should still have a written record to hand him or her that discusses performance.Even when presenting a bad review, try to remain professional. For instance, you shouldn't say, ""You're an emotional jerk, and you need to get control of your life."" Instead, you should say, ""We've noticed that your home life has been affecting your personal life in the last 3 months. While we appreciate that your problems at home have been difficult, we expect you to remain professional while on the job.""
Discuss any consequences. For instance, if the person received a good review, note that she will receive a bonus, while if she received a bad one, she will be placed on probation.

, Collaborate to reveal realistic ways the employee can improve, such as allowing more time to meet daily report deadlines. Both of you should be willing to compromise. That is, if the employee cannot realistically meet certain goals, you should adjust the goals. However, if the employee is not getting work done because he or she is not focusing, the employee should be the one to figure out a way to adjust.


Offer to coach the employee to help overcome weaknesses. Ensure that the administrative assistant feels valued.

, Unless the person's personality is affecting his or her work, focus solely on the job the person is doing. In other words, be objective in evaluating how the person is doing without getting into personality conflicts.If the person's personality is affecting the job, focus on the job not the person. For instance, you could say, ""X has been rude to a customer at least once a week, causing lost revenue,"" not ""X is too emotional.""

, If you want to test how your administrative assistant is interacting with people when you're not around, hire testers to come in and ask for help or to call on the phone. Give them a script and a form to evaluate how your assistant performed.

Document personnel matters as they occur, not weeks or months later.,
Set aside some time.,
Describe the highlights of a conversation.,
Stick to the facts.,
Include exhibits and other support to build airtight documentation.,
Document disciplinary meetings with employees by taking notes that summarize three elements of the conversations.,
Ask an employee to review and sign an acknowledgment of your documentation.",How to Document Employee Performance," To serve their purpose, documents must reflect a complete, accurate account of what individuals discussed and what events transpired on a specific date.;
, The benefits of documentation far outweigh the time and effort required to performance-related conversations with your workers. Write down what topics were discussed, who was present, what issues or concerns arose and what promises or agreements were made, you build a paper trail for future reference. Amassing a well-documented employee file prevents misunderstanding among all parties and affords legal protection to you and your employer in the event of litigation.

, Summarize negotiated terms (i.e., who will do what, by what deadline), warnings issued to an employee, specific performance measures that you reviewed together, and itemized commitments by all sides.

, Don’t treat your notes of conversations with employees as a personal journal, where you express opinions and share emotions. Documents can become public record in a court of law, so keep clear, professional notes. Write in a detached tone, as if you’re an outsider detailing what happened from a safe distance. Focus on quality of work, behavior and conduct, attendance and availability. Do not attack an employee’s character.

, This will be different depending on the situation you are coaching. Examples include the following: complaint letters from customers as evidence of an employee’s poor service delivery; copies of time cards as proof of an employee’s chronic tardiness; copy of a consultant’s analysis of an employee’s poor productivity.

,

Skill identification from the job description.,
Club all the skills across organization.,
Frame skill categories.,
Devote skills into categories.,
Prepare a skill dictionary.,
Understand the levels.,
Mapping is comparison.,
Identify the Gap and translate it.,
Measure the effectiveness.,
Map the resource again.,
Link the evaluation with performance appraisal schemes.",How to Do Competency Mapping in an Organization," Every resource has their designated set of job description allotted. Identify the skills from the explained job description. Example- One of the job description for a CNC operator is: - He/ She needs to maintain the machine daily after completing their shift. Skill Identified: - Knowledge of 5S( A concept for maintaining cleanliness). Competency identified:- Awareness towards safety and hazard.;
, Repeat the above-mentioned process department wise. Talk to managers and resources. Sum up all the JDS and list down every possible skill that contribute towards an effective task performance.

, Fix the categories apt for your organization. This may depend on your organizational industry, product, strength and client base too. Example- Technical, Behavioral and Processes; are some of the category that are common to almost all.

, Use your common sense and assign every single skill set into its suitable category. Example. “Machining” is a skill under Technical parameter. However, “5S” (the concept) will go to Processes and “Behavioral safety” can be fixed at Behavioral parameter.

, As the name suggests, it is the explained dictionary of every skill that we have mentioned above. We have to explain level wise description of every skill. You can either choose a three - level or four – level dictionary. Level 1 being lowest, Level 2 is Needs improvement, level 3 being Average and level 4 is good. If the highest level is level 5, try to mark accordingly.

, If your dictionary has level 1 being lowest, every single addition to its level is commensurate with the difficulty/ perfection level to perform the task. And Level 4 is the epitome for perfection. Assigning resources to these levels depicts their present caliber and knowledge level in that particular skill. Example- If I assign Mr. Gorge (Works at manufacturing industry as a CNC operator for past 2 years) at level 3 in “Machining” skill, then According to the dictionary, I am stating that he is having an average level of understanding for this skill.

, One resource needs to map twice against every single skill. As it is a tool to enhance the skill and get the appropriate training hence, Mr. Gorge needs to map again for knowing what is the desired skill level for him to perform the machining task most efficiently. It will vary according to designation, years of work experience and educational qualification. Example- If Mr, Gorge is a diploma holder and is working at junior level associate, his required level of competency would be level 4 (On a scale of 1-5). And if he is a graduate and is at mid-level associate, the desired level of competency would be much high as at level 5.

, Gap between Actual and Desired is the source of Training need identification. Comprehend the gap and fix it with appropriate training and seminar scheduling.

, The measurement can be done in two phases. One, just after the training, with a questionnaire and on-job performance. And Two, After six months of training, imparted. The second phase of measurement is aimed to testify the retention level.

, Competency mapping is a cyclic process. If, after two-phased evaluation, the resource has improved, then the actual skill level is enhanced and so the desired one too.

, It is a very useful tool for objective appraisals.

Do as you say.,
Try to be as transparent as possible.,
Show your employees that you are competent and willing to acquire new skills.,
Make reliability a habit.",How to Earn Your Employees' Trust1," One of the most effective ways to gain an employee’s trust is to keep your word. This means that when you say you will do something, be it give your employees a raise, or fix the vending machine, you do it. Keeping your word also includes being on time for meetings, and respecting your employee’s wish to discuss something with you; if you say you are going to be free at 10:30 to talk to an employee, do everything you can to be free at that time. This may help your employees to trust you, because they will see that you do what you say.


On the other hand, if you don’t follow through with what you say, your employees may think that they have to remind you again and again about something you said awhile ago. This can cause tension in the workplace, and is not conducive to a trusting—or productive—environment.;
, To the best of your abilities—and to the extent that your boss wishes—try to openly discuss the state of the company with your employees. Discuss the challenges the company is facing, as well as the goals and achievements. You can also discuss the challenges you are personally facing at your job; being open about your own state of affairs may help your employees to feel that they can discuss their own challenges with you.


Of course, there is some information you cannot share, like the salaries of other employees.

, Keep in mind that your employees may come to you for help with challenges they are facing; if you demonstrate that you can be of assistance, and know what you are doing, they will be more likely to trust you.


While this does not mean that you have to be know how to do everything around the office, you should have a grasp on what you have claimed that you specialize in. If you do not know how to do something, do not try to show fake knowledge; instead admit that you aren’t sure what to do, and then call in the person you do think will know how to solve the problem so that you, the employee, and the person you have called in can work on the problem together.

, Try to be consistent in your interactions with your employees; rather than making your trustworthiness a one time deal, try to demonstrate in often. Remember that sticking to your word can help you to gain the trust of your employees.

"
"
Create opportunities to get to know your employees.,
Promote a sense of belonging.,
Discuss what trust means to your employees.,
Offer encouragement rather than giving commands.,
Give employees credit, and take the blame when needed.,
Don’t play favorites.,
Keep your work environment exciting.",How to Earn Your Employees' Trust2," One effective way to gain an employee’s trust is to make the effort to get to know them. This could be as simple as chatting with them about their interests, or arranging a company event where employees and mingle.


Really pay attention when talking to your employees about themselves. Once you have learned their interests, involve them in tasks that tailor to their interests. For example, if you know one of your employees really likes hockey, ask that person to help you organize a company-wide outing to a hockey game.

, Try to make everyone as comfortable as possible in your work environment. Promote a sense of belonging and ownership so that employees won’t consider their jobs as a burden. Instead, they will view their contributions as a way to promote the overall growth of the business.


Try to create a healthy balance between professionalism and friendship. Try to make your employees feel relaxed, and help them to pursue their own personal goals at the company when you can.

, Trust is a subjective term, and may mean different things to different people. Because of this, actively seek your employees’ opinions or ask them questions about how they interpret the concept of trust. Create a survey that your employees can take anonymously. Your survey can progressively include statements like:


There is not much trust between employees and management – seeking a yes or no answer or degree of satisfaction.
I feel I can trust my immediate supervisor/manager – personalized question that is not subject to widely interpreting the word “trust”.
I get fair treatment from my supervisor/manager – leaving the word “trust” aside and seeking what makes employees content.
Identifying what employees consider trust will open new avenues of earning their trust and it will bring opportunities of addressing their trust issues in a better way.

, Trust can get worn down if you continue to give commands and orders without also giving encouragement. In order to keep a healthy amount of trust between you and your employees, it is important to motivate them and make them feel empowered.


Delegate tasks that include making decisions; this shows that you trust their abilities.
Tell your employees how their performance will be measured, and offer encouragement when they meet or surpass these standards.

, Try to give credit where credit is due, rather than taking the credit for your employee’s work. Giving your employee’s credit will help them to feel that you are all working towards a shared goal, and that you have no hidden agenda.


As it occurs, take blame for any poor leadership or mismanagement that you feel was your fault. Admit to areas that need improvement. This will show your employees that you hold yourself as accountable as you hold them.

, If you only ask a few employees out to lunch, or to get drinks after work, it will become clear to your other employees that you are playing favorites. This can severely damage your employees’ trust in you, as it shows that your private and official personas diverge.


At the same time, do not actively show that you dislike anyone. Talking behind an employee’s back with another employee is absolutely out of the question.

, To go the extra mile, make your office feel like a fun place to be; bring your employees surprises, like pizza or refreshments to break up a monotonous day at the office. These treats act as a gesture of appreciation to show your employees that you appreciate their hard work.


You could also consider setting up office parties or outings.

Call a meeting of top team leaders and managers.,
Analyze your strengths and opportunities.,
Assess your weaknesses and threats.,
Set goals for your business.,
Create a strategy and short-term tactics.,
Develop a vision for the business.",How to Do Strategic Planning1," Before you can start devising a strategic plan, you need to make sure that the people developing the overall strategy can get feedback from those that must implement it on the ground. Talk to team leaders and management and get their perspective on the problems in your organization. Include them on discussions in development and planning so that they can evaluate the plan's feasibility and uncover any unforeseen costs that may be incurred when trying to implement it.Including top management into developing strategic plans will also get them to feel a sense of ownership over the strategy, which will help with implementation.
Consider the time and human capital that's required for your strategic plan and talk to managers to see if it's possible that employees can adapt or change their schedules to meet their new goals.Create an agenda that lays out a presentation of your strategic visions and that leaves time for managers and team leaders to provide feedback.;
, Think of your organization's competitive advantages, or the set of traits that gives your company an advantage over its competitors, such as a lower manufacturing cost or proprietary technology. Reflect on how you can use your strengths to take advantage of opportunities you have available due to the consumer demand, or changes in the social or cultural climate that may help drive sales of your product or service.Strengths may include a highly successful or efficient team, such as a good marketing an advertising department or strong sales department.To find more opportunities that play to your strengths, make sure that your team is watching external factors like consumer buying habits or social trends.
For instance, an opportunity may include a growing infrastructure in another country if you are a utility provider or construction company., Weaknesses are internal factors that make your organization more inefficient and that waste time and money. Threats are external factors that could hinder your business and include things like an economic downturn or a competitor. Find the departments within your company that are struggling and determine their weaknesses.


Weaknesses could include things like poor leadership, a lack of skills or expertise, or a poor reputation with customers.
Internal factors can be solved with additional training or re-allocation of responsibility.
External threats that can be combated by concentrating on your company's strengths to overcome what is happening in the industry.Be honest about your weaknesses so that you can devise a plan that targets specific portions of your organization.
Sometimes team leaders or employees can have valuable input on threats and weaknesses.

, Determine what goals you want your company to achieve. Make sure that there is a significant driver behind the strategic decisions that you make, and that these decisions are always made with your goals in mind. Once you have goals in mind, you can begin to create strategies to achieve them.


Some goals may include increasing revenue, getting a larger customer base, or increasing employee productivity.
Keep your goals realistic and attainable so that your team strives to accomplish them instead of giving up.
Make sure to set a timeline to accomplish your goals.

, Your strategy will be determined by the type of industry that you're in or the type of work that your organization does. An overall strategy is your plan on how to achieve long-term goals.Tactics are more easily measurable and are actions that you can take that will help you reach your strategy. Think of what will assist in achieving your goals and create an action plan with tactics that you can use to reach it.


Strategies can include things like increasing profits by reducing manufacturing costs or increasing employee satisfaction by improving employee training.
Tactics include things like changing employee hours or updating the packaging on a product.

, The vision for your business is the long-term goals that you want your organization to be able to achieve. Develop a cohesive vision by making sure that your strategy adheres to your company culture, branding, and your current consumers. Build your strategic plan around accomplishing your end vision.


Being able to explain your vision will give an idea to stakeholders, investors, and employees clarity in understanding the reason for your strategic planning and your goals.A vision may be something like achieving much greater eco-friendly standards by 2025 or becoming one of the largest companies within an industry.

"
Allow your staff to influence you.,
Be there for your employees when they need you.,
Emphasize impact over profits.,
Share your successes as a leader.,
Clearly communicate what is expected of your team.,
Ask questions.,
Talk less in meetings with staff.,
Collaborate, don’t just delegate.,
Allow your employees to be themselves.,
Cultivate strong leaders.,
Be consistent in how you interact with your staff.,
Give recognition for a job well done.,
Let go of negative opinions.",How to Engage Staff," If your staff believes that you will truly hear the things they say, they will be more apt to embrace open communication in both directions. When an employee offers you a good idea, acknowledge it and incorporate it into you plan moving forward.If employees feel as though they have a say in how things happen, they will be more engaged with you as their manager and the job in general.
By demonstrating that you value their opinions, you establish a culture in which the opinions of others are respected, including your own.;
, It’s important that an employee believes their manager will go to bat for them if they need it. By demonstrating that you support your team, their respect for you will grow and allow you to establish a more meaningful connection with each of them.When an employee comes to you with a problem, work with them to solve it without being overly critical of what they did to cause the issue.
Try your best to help your employees when they are struggling. If an employee experiences a death in their family, do everything you can to permit them the time off that they need, for instance. This demonstrates that you care and are willing to make things happen for your team.

, It can be easy to get stuck on the idea of money, after all, that’s what you’re in the business for, but don’t let money be everything. Instead of constantly discussing reducing costs or increasing output to improve the bottom line, discuss the impact your team’s work has on the company as a whole, or on the world outside of it.Instead of using money as the bar by which you measure success, reframe success in the minds of your staff.
Discuss the way your team’s hard work has improved things for the company, or your customers. Instead of saying “we sold 10,000 units this quarter and made a half a million dollars” suggest that “we put 10,000 copy machines in the hands of hard working folks that needed them.”

, If your team is performing well, it will reflect well upon you as a leader, but don’t get caught up in accepting all the accolades yourself. Make sure you let your team know how valuable their efforts were in any successes you achieve as the supervisor or manager of your team.If you receive an award, make sure to thank your team when presented with it, then again back in the office to emphasize how much you appreciate their work.
Giving your staff a sense that you value them will make them feel actively involved in the department’s victories and therefore increase engagement.

, It’s imperative that you make your expectations clear so your team knows what the measure of success will be. Be clear about the rules so there can be no confusion when you have to correct someone for breaking them, but also be clear about your objectives, so no one wastes time on something that is unimportant.Employees become anxious when they aren’t sure how you will judge their performance when it comes time for reviews. Meet with each new employee and lay out what you expect them to do in their position right from the start.
Be clear about your rules and enforce them equally. If you are a stickler for being on time, make sure your team knows it. If you don’t mind employees trickling in a few minutes late but you expect them to adhere to a certain dress code, make sure they know what’s important to you.

, As tempting as it may be to manage your meetings by simply running through the important points that need to be covered and getting back to work, don’t forget to take time to ask your employees their opinions on things. Ask them questions one on one as well, to demonstrate your care for what’s going on in their lives both professionally and socially.Address individuals when asking questions. Instead of saying, “does anyone have any suggestions?” try saying, “Janet, you’ve worked with this sort of thing before, what did you find was successful?”
Ask your employees about their weekend, or about the things on their desks that indicate the things that matter to them. Photos of family, a Batman figurine, or an award hanging in someone’s office or cubicle are great things to ask them about to create a dialogue.

, When you are interacting with your staff, try not to dominate the conversation. Instead listen to what your team has to say actively and only interject when you need to. This will demonstrate the value you place on what they are saying and give your team an opportunity to develop a rapport with one another.Allowing your team to communicate amongst themselves with you present to interject as needed gives natural leaders the opportunity to develop and thrive under your tutelage.
Step in to offer guidance when it’s necessary, but let your team know you trust them by allowing them to take the lead on some topics.

, When you and your team have a project to complete that is outside of your area of expertise, seek help from your team. Creating a collaborative environment will help make each employee feel invested in the success of the project and you may find that they have valuable input about how best to complete the task.Let your team know that you are open to suggestions.
Have strategy meetings wherein you encourage your staff to brainstorm possible ways to complete projects or resolve issues.

, Expecting your employees to behave in the same manner that you do creates tension without you realizing it. By embracing your employees as they are, you increase your chances of being able to truly engage them.An employee that feels comfortable around you will engage with you honestly, rather than just saying what they think you want to hear.
Engaging with employees means addressing them as they are, not as you’d like them to be.

, Give the members of your staff the opportunity to develop their own leadership skills. Put them in charge of projects or appoint supervisors on the floor. Giving your staff leadership experience will help them to better understand your decisions and make them better rounded employees.By appointing staff members to leadership positions, you let them know that you notice and acknowledge their abilities in your field.
A good employee may eventually want to move on to the next step in their career. While you may not want to see them go, a good manager will help prepare them for that next step.

, Fair can be a frustrating word in business. What some people perceive as unfair is often simply because they don’t understand everything that is going on. Instead of focusing on being “fair,” focus on being consistent in your interactions with employees.Don’t demonstrate favoritism for any employee. If you allow one staff member to come in late all the time but chastise others, the resulting negative feelings could create a communications gap between you and your team.
Be demonstrating consistency, your staff will be more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt when they question something you do or say. Instead of thinking, “jeez, Sarah never lets me get away with that,” they may say, “Sarah must have had a good reason to let that go.”

, When an individual in your team goes above and beyond, make sure to give them recognition in front of the whole team. Let your staff know that hard work is not only appreciated, but rewarded.When your team sees that working hard will be rewarded, they may work hard in hopes of achieving the same type of reward.
Even if your team isn’t directly motivated by wanting to win an award or recognition, knowing that they could will emphasize the value you place on your team.

, Things are bound to go wrong and members of your staff are going to make mistakes. When you need to correct someone, do so, but don’t hold a grudge. After you tell someone what they did wrong and what your expectation are for the future, let it go.Having a “short memory” in regard to negative experiences will help your staff feel like they can come to you with problems as they arise.
Chronic issues should be addressed as such, but occasional mistakes should be corrected and then moved on from.

Task managers with developing an operational plan.,
Hold team members to deadlines and results.,
Evaluate your strategic plan's effectiveness.,
Adapt to improve your plan.",How to Do Strategic Planning2," Once your overall plan is complete, you'll need to work alongside top managers to make sure that they can develop a meaningful operations plan to accomplish their goal. For instance, it's not enough to install equipment that will save workers time to construct auto parts; you must also factor in the time and cost of re-training employees and details like installing and receiving the new equipment.


An operational plan may include things like re-training, or changing an existing operation to be more efficient or utilize newly acquired equipment or hardware.
Another operational plan may include notifying or sending out memos to employees on a change in policy.

, Holding team members accountable for their results will make a more reliable team. Having the right team is critical for implementing a strategic plan effectively. Make sure to be specific about deadlines and the consequences for not completing a task.Have an open and honest conversation with employees who meet deadlines. If they consistently miss them, consider finding someone else that can meet the requirements for the job.
If you must talk to an employee, you can say something like, ""Bill, I know that there's been a lot of operational disruption this month, but you've consistently missed the last three deadlines in a row. Can you explain what you think is stopping you from meeting the deadlines?""
If you need to fire someone because they miss deadlines, you can say something like ""Joe, your progress has been less than acceptable for the last month or two and your missed deadlines are affecting the rest of the team's progress. I'm going to have to ask you to pack your stuff and leave.""
Check with HR to make sure that firing the employee is consistent with legal guidelines and company policy.

, Continue to monitor the progress of your strategic plan once you implement it. Consider whether your plan or tactics have helped you reach your goals. If you haven't reached your goals, it's time to evaluate your plan again and figure out if it's an aspect of the plan that's preventing you from achieving them, or if the plan and tactics are not being implemented correctly.Check in with managers and team leaders to see if your plan is being implemented. If the changes that your strategic plan have not taken place, then you can't hope to achieve your goals.
Use benchmarks to check in on the progress of your plan as it develops.
For instance, if your plan included increasing revenue in the first quarter of 2017, but you failed to meet your goals, go back and evaluate where your plan is failing.

, When you are developing your strategic plan, you should also develop a process on how to change and adapt with the market. New technology, changes in the industry, or unforeseen operational difficulties may make your plan ineffective. Instead of letting a weak program continue, you should change your course of action and alter it to fit the current reality of your company and industry.For instance, if you change your customer service system to an automated system which saves money on employee cost, but the majority of clients threaten to leave because of the modification, it may be time to alter your original plan and offer limited operator services as well.

"
"
Enhance team communication.,
Hold productive meetings.,
Use the right people.,
Listen to the demands of the consumer.",How to Do Strategic Planning3," Make sure that all team members have access to the methods of communication you have and are all shared on critical or necessary documents. Explain the companies goals and strategies in a clear way, so that team members are all on the same page. Encourage everyone to communicate with one another and hold active and frequent discussions. Make any changes in the strategy known to the entire organization so that everyone can work towards the same goals.Methods of communication include phone, email, and chat systems.
As a leader of an organization, it's important that you develop good facilitation techniques so that you can resolve issues as soon as they develop.
Persistent chat rooms show messages in real time and are saved over time. Consider using one to keep all of your team members on the same page.

, The most productive meetings have clearly stated objectives and allow everyone to put in their unique input and perspective. Keep an agenda for the meeting and don't allow it to go off topic or break down into conjecture. Good meetings should have employees walking away with a better understanding of what their colleagues are working on and how it ties into their work. It should also provide them clarity on how their tasks influence the overall strategic plan.Take new problems and create short-term tactics and solutions.


Meetings will also help you gauge the effectiveness of any strategic plan by getting input from employees.
Create a printout of the agenda before the meeting so that everyone can stay on the same page.

, Once you set up your strategic plan, it's important that you allocate the best employees to the task to maximize your plan's efficiency. If you are monitoring the success of the plan and notice that team members skills or talents aren't being used in the best way, look to reorganize your team. Talk to managers to help you evaluate who is best for what department and move people around if you have to.


Place people in the roles that they have experience in.In order to successfully implement some strategic plans, you'll need to hire new talent.
Make sure that you choose people who work well together, as well as basing people's placement upon their own skills or personalities.

, Strategic plans are only as useful if it creates additional value for the customer in some way. If your strategic plan is something that your customers don't agree with, they can potentially stop buying your products. Develop a strategic plan with the customer in mind. Come up with strategies that will give them additional value or that they can appreciate.


Read market research to see trends in the industry that you're in.Communicate with customers via social media or polls to determine what they like about your strategic plan.
For instance, if consumer spending skyrockets on internet streaming services, your company should consider going into that space even if the company has sold traditional media in the past.

Consider what makes them stand out.,
Look at where an employee performs the best.,
Watch how employees pick up skills.,
Use self-assessments.,
Ask for colleague evaluations.,
Limit your focus.,
Let employees use their strengths.,
Provide challenges.,
Use continuing education to your advantage.,
Allow space for volunteering.,
Set up mentorship programs.,
Build teams mindfully.,
Try job shadowing.,
Use job rotation.",How to Develop Strengths in Employees," You may not be able to list an employee's strength off the top of your head, even if you value the person. However, one way to start thinking about what an employee is best out is to consider how they distinguish themselves from their colleagues, and not necessarily in intentional ways.For instance, say your employee is Becky. When you start thinking about her, you think about how she is able to talk to anyone, colleague or customer. While you may not have perceived that as an asset at first, you should consider it a strength, as she is able to communicate well.;
, You don't just have to use subjective analysis to determine an employee's strengths. You can also use the data to point where an employee does best.For instance, you may look at the numbers and notice that Debra is the fastest at turning in her reports and always has the fewest errors. That could mean her strengths lie in written communication and synthesizing information.
Another example is looking at who is able to make the most conversions in a company. That indicates a person who has good sales skills.

, Whether you are training employees yourself or others are doing it, notice which employees pick up which skills the fastest. Paying attention to how employees pick up skills tells you where they are strongest.For instance, one employee may not be great at the filing system, but maybe she's picked up how to edit the company's website with ease. Obviously, she's better at newer technology.
It's also important to note what skills employees choose to pick up on their own. Often, that indicates a place where they have a strength or would like to create a strength. Either way, noticing which skills an employee is most interested in will give you a good idea of where they need encouragement. For instance, if a person consistently works on coding or the website, that person obviously is good at technology and wants to learn more about it.

, Your employees are, of course, going to have blind spots about themselves. Nonetheless, they should be able to help identify some of their own strengths. A good way to encourage that practice is to use a self-assessment form.You can base your own form off a form online or simply build one yourself. Basically, all you need is a list of skills and strengths with competency levels off to the side. You may also leave space for employees to write-in strengths they believe they have.Self-assessment does have it drawbacks, as obviously your employee is going to want to look as good as possible for you, the employer. That means that you have to emphasize that you are wanting to help develop what people are best at, not punish people for not having every skill.
You can also have an area that lets employees establish what skills they enjoy the most. When an employee enjoys a particular area, she will likely be more receptive to learning more., You don't see everything that goes on in the office. Your employees probably see much more of what goes on, so using peer assessments can help you to fill in the gaps.Make clear guidelines about who gets to review whom. Does the person who's being reviewed get to choose who reviews them? Will you make those designations? Does every person need to review the same number of people? All of these questions need to be answered as you set up a peer review system.
For instance, if you let your employees choose, they will likely pick people who know them best. On the one hand, that means they'll know the person's strengths, but they also might paint the person too positively. On the other hand, if you choose, the reviewers may be more objective, but they may also not know the other employee's work as well.
Focus on the positive. Identify what traits you most want to see in your employees, and use that as a basis for evaluation.You can have reviewers rate others on competency levels for these traits, for instance.
Provide a form. You need to create a specific way for employees to review each other. A simple form with a list of strengths and competencies will work, as long as you leave room for other feedback., It can be tempting to try to develop all a person's strengths at once. However, it's better to really focus on one or two strengths at a time. Focusing on too many can lead to no strengths being developed because your energy and the person's energy is focused too thinly.One way you can choose is to pick the top places a person really stands out.
Another option is to look at where a person has raw talent that still needs development rather than the person's strengths that are already in full swing. In other words, if a person is already great at technology, maybe skip developing that right now in favor of working on her written communication skills, where she shows promise but could use more development.
A third option is focusing on skills the company particularly needs. If you're having trouble deciding between two strengths, go with the one that would benefit the company the most., Once you realize what an employee is best at, it's important to put them to work in those areas. Not only do you get a benefit from an employee doing well in that area, the employee gets a chance to practice even more and become better over time.For instance, someone whose strength lies in verbal communication may be wasted in an area that has no contact with customers.
On the other hand, you may find someone who's good at technology who isn't being utilized that way. Expanding that person's job description to include technological work can benefit both of you and give the employee needed challenges.

, One way to help people develop their skills is to challenge them a bit. If the same person is always doing the same job, they become complacent, and their skills don't grow. Tasks that require a higher skill level make people rise to the challenge.Try to challenge people just above their current skill level. That is, you don't want someone who's barely learned the phone system to try to learn how to code a website. Maybe a better challenge would be to learn how to provide feedback through the website, which requires them to learn how to navigate the website.
You don't want to throw the person in the deep end, but you do want to challenge them just enough that they must grow and learn to meet the challenge.

, Continuing education, such as workshops, conferences, and classes, help employees to develop or renew strengths. Encouraging your employees to take advantage of these opportunities will only serve to develop strengths.Try to take away as many hurdles as possible between your employees and continuing education classes.
Of course, you can require a certain number a year, but you can also encourage employees to take advantage of opportunities by paying for continuing education, making sure employees are paid for their time while there, and even providing opportunities for continuing education in office.
For instance, you can bring in experts to lead workshops on certain skills and strengths to help employees improve.
Don't forget that some continuing education can be done online.

, Volunteering in the community is a great way to develop strengths. In addition, encouraging your employees to volunteer not only helps the community, it makes your company look good in the process.One way to encourage volunteering is to allow employees a certain amount of paid time off a week to go volunteer, such as an hour or two.Another way to encourage volunteering is to have incentives. For instance, you could have a race to see who can get the most volunteer hours, with prizes going to the top contenders.How you set up the volunteering is up to you. You could handpick volunteering opportunities to encourage certain skills. However, employees may resent being forced into volunteering at places they don't want to be. If you let employees choose, they'll likely gravitate to places that use their skills, anyway.

, You have obviously have employees who are more experienced in your company and ones that are less experienced. Through a mentorship program, the more experienced employees can help the less experienced develop their strengths.Decide whether the program will be voluntary or mandatory. If it's voluntary, you may want to offer incentives for joining the program.
Try to pair employees with like skills. For instance, if you notice an employee with good written communication skills who, at the same time, could still use a little work, try pairing him with a more experienced staff member whose skills are excellent.

, When putting together teams of people to work on projects, consider how their skill sets would mesh. If you can, try putting people together who can learn from each other as they work together.For instance, one team member may be good at numbers while another one is better at seeing the big picture. The numbers person can help the big-picture person pay attention to the details, while the big-picture person can help the numbers person look beyond the minutia, helping to develop new strengths.
Another way of look at this step is to put more experienced members with less experienced members. That way, the experienced people can help the less experienced members develop their skills in the group.

, Job shadowing is when one employee goes about her job while another person follows her to see how it is done. The first person should provide some explanation of what she is doing as it is possible.Shadowing helps employees learn or develop skills by watching someone more skilled at work. How long one employee shadows another employee depends on you, the employer, and what exactly you want the person shadowing to gain from the experience. For instance, if you just want him to get an idea of what the job is like, a day or so is probably fine. If you want him to spend time developing strengths, you probably want to let it go on for longer.
Usually, a person lower in the hierarchy follows someone higher up, or one person from one department follows someone from another department for cross-training.

, Job rotation is when employees switch out jobs to learn different skills. It is somewhat like job shadowing, except the employee is actually doing the job rather than watching someone else do it.This step works well because it gives employees a chance to actually practice the skills rather than just watch.
Job rotations can be short-term or long-term. You can have a day of rotation, or jobs could switch out every year.However, it's important to leave some people in place who know what they're doing, so they can help the people rotating to figure out what's going on.

Consider the goals of your organization.,
Identify the benefits for trainees.,
Recognize desired outcomes.",How to Develop a Training Plan1," In order to conduct effective training sessions, you need to keep in mind the objectives of your business or organization. These goals should guide you as you develop your training plan. For example, if the main goal of your business is to increase sales of medical supplies, you'll want to make sure to convey that to your trainees.If your company has a mission or vision statement, use that to guide you as you develop your training goals. You want the training goals to be compatible with the overall objectives of your company.
Be aware of what you want to accomplish. For instance, the purpose of the training may be to prepare employees for emergencies, improve business offerings or protect the privacy of clients.;
, Make it clear to your trainees that there will be tangible benefits that each will gain by completing the training. Perhaps your trainee will earn a new certification that qualifies her for more responsibility. Or maybe there is greater job security for those who have completed training. Whatever the case, convey these benefits at the outset of training.Outline the skills, information, and certifications that participants will gain by undergoing the training. These might include mastery of specific software applications, detailed knowledge of company policies and procedures, or enhanced customer service skills.

, Include in your plan the specific outcomes you want the training to achieve. Be as clear as possible. These should be more specific than the overall goals of the training. For example, you could say, ""At the end of training, we will have 25 new employees ready to begin their first week of work in the Accounting Department at XYZ"".If possible, note the benefits of achieving these goals. You might note, ""Once these new employees are trained we will have X number more hours of production each week, which should increase our overall profits by X%.""

"
"
Establish a clear goal and mission.",How to Develop Guidelines For Team Building in the Workplace1," Your team's goal might be to release a new version of a product by a specific date. Or the goal might be to conduct market research in order to create a marketing plan. Be as specific as possible about the eventual goal.


Distribute the goal in writing to all team members. Ideally, you'll do this in person in a team meeting so that you can answer any questions and concerns. A goals meeting also helps the group to develop consensus on the direction of the team or company.;
"
"
Plan necessary steps.,
Design lessons.,
Outline the training structure.,
Establish a time frame.,
Create a section for training prep.",How to Develop a Training Plan2," A good training plan will indicate exactly how you will accomplish your goals. You should indicate how long training will last, how many sessions will occur, and what will happen during each session. Make sure that the steps align with your specific and broad objectives.Create a training topic outline. When conducting training on productivity software, for example, your topics may include creating files, formatting text, copying and pasting text and saving files.Break down the topics into specific titles. For example, formatting text might be divided up into 3 separate lessons: formatting fonts, paragraphs and tables.

, Include in your training plan a list of lessons complete with lesson objectives, specific activities and assessment plans, which may include pre- and post-tests, class discussions, or group activities. Figure out the length of each lesson. Determine whether you will need additional materials or resources for the individual lessons.Determine the best training modality. You might deliver the training via online files, video conferencing, in person instruction or audio files. Choose the method based on the objective. For example, software navigation may be best taught in person or via video, whereas delivering information about safety procedures may be adequately communicated through web-based files.
Engage participants to engage in the training activity. Puzzles, problem-solving exercises, questions, and writing activities are ways to keep trainees focused on tasks.
Participation can help the trainees more effectively absorb the material.
Accommodate a variety of learning styles. Watching video demonstrations, listening to audio and participating in hands-on exercises are ways to diversity activities.

, In your plan, offer specifics about all of the methods you will use in training. For example, if you plan to use a variety of modalities, such as Skype and in-person sessions, make that clear from the outset. It is also useful to explain your objectives for using a variety of methods.For instance, explain that you will use one-on-one training for detail-oriented tasks. Some tasks are best learned by observing and actively doing them across a substantial period of time. In this case, one-on-one training delivered in the form of shadowing an experienced person might be best.
You could also note that you will train people in small groups for tasks requiring interaction. Teaching customer service skills, for example, may be done in small groups using role-play and problem-solving activities.
Utilize large group training for overviews. Delivery of information and overviews can be done in large groups. Break the large group into smaller groups, if necessary.

, To master new skills, trainees might need to meet 1 hour each day for several weeks. If they must be trained by a certain date, include these requirements in your training plan. Indicate whether current employees will need to add this to their additional duties, or if she will need to ask a coworker to help cover responsibilities while she is training.


Establish a timeline for making all preparations. For example, you might hire a trainer a month in advance, book a meeting space 2 weeks in advance and inform all trainees of the training location and requirements several weeks in advance.

, Your training plan should be a comprehensive document that will make it simple for others to follow your instructions. Therefore, you should indicate exactly how to prepare for training sessions. Be as specific as possible, so that other trainers will have a clear idea of how to accomplish the goals.Include a list of resources in the training plan. Trainers may need presentation tools, a computer or chalk. Trainees may need workbooks, training guides, video players or other equipment.
Review the list of resources prior to the training. Consider each step of the training to ensure that all equipment, materials, and tools are accessible and functional.

"
"
Assess the training.,
Offer alternatives.,
Indicate the training participants.,
Utilize your colleagues.,
Choose qualified trainers.",How to Develop a Training Plan3," Your training plan should include ways that the trainers can evaluate the training as it progresses. There should be clear benchmarks that measure the effectiveness of the training. Specifically state the points during training where the goals should be measured.Have concrete assessment tools included in your training plan. For example, you could have trainees complete a quiz or test after each module.
Have trainers ask for feedback. In your training plan, indicate that trainers should observe the trainees attitudes. If the trainees seem lost or unmotivated, indicate that that trainers should address that.

, Not every group of trainees will respond the same to your training methods. You training plan should indicate that trainers will need to be prepared to teach the material in a different way. For each section of content, your training plan should indicate a couple of different ways to convey the material.For example, some groups may be less talkative than others. Instead of a large group question and answer session, have the the trainees work in pairs.
In your delivery of the material, you will likely use specific examples to illustrate your points. If the trainees do not seem to comprehend the material, make sure that there are alternate examples included in the training plan.

, Your training may be organization-wide, geared toward a single department or designed specifically for entry-level employees. You may develop separate training plans for different groups or teams. In each plan, be clear about the group that is the focus of the training.Group the trainees by training type. For example, some members of the organization may need simple overviews, whereas others involved in the day-to-day completion of tasks may require in-depth training.

, For example, you will need to calculate training costs. If you are not involved with accounting, you may need to ask someone familiar with your company's financials for some information. Review the list of required training resources to determine how much money you will need. #*Other costs to consider include meeting space rental, trainer compensation and employee time.


You may also need to speak to your organization's facilities manager. They can help you reserve conference rooms or lecture facilities.
Let your IT department know that you might need some assistance during training, particularly if you are teaching online or using tools such as video conferencing.

, In order to offer the most effective training, you will need to select the highest quality employee to conduct the training sessions. They may be people already working for the organization or outside experts. Examine their qualifications and experience before hiring.Look for trainers who have experience using the methods that you want to offer. For example, if your training is to be conducted online, make sure to find someone who feels comfortable using that platform.
Communicate with your trainers. Allow them the opportunity to ask questions and make sure that they clearly understand the objectives and desired outcomes.

"
Establish communication rules for team meetings.",How to Develop Guidelines For Team Building in the Workplace2," Rules might include listening when other team members are talking, contributing during team meetings, speaking honestly and refraining from using belittling or offensive language.


Decide how to increase individual contributions during team discussions. Whether over email, during conference calls or in person, team members must feel that their opinions are important. You might call on individuals to contribute during meetings, or email them ahead of time to ask that they prepare and deliver a team report.
Define all relevant language and terminology. For example, you might agree as a group to use acronyms to increase efficiency in communications. Give team members from different departments a chance to ask questions and gain clarity about unfamiliar expressions and terminology.
Prevent the same 1 or 2 people from dominating team meetings. Set time limits on how long each person speaks, or specifically ask quieter team members to present or lead a discussion.

"
Develop a task list.,
Rotate roles to increase skill building and team effort.,
Clarify deadlines.",How to Develop Guidelines For Team Building in the Workplace3," Clarify all processes and plans in writing, and specify the roles and responsibilities of each individual.

, When team members work in a new role, they gain an appreciation for the responsibilities of others and learn new skills. For example, when working in small groups, a different person can facilitate group meetings each week or present to the larger group.

, Each team member must have clear guidelines on when specific tasks are due.

"
Inspire team members to work together.,
Minimize competition by rewarding group effort.,
Increase motivation for group work.",How to Develop Guidelines For Team Building in the Workplace4," Pair up workers with compatible work styles to achieve a certain task within a specified timeline. Ask team members who can learn from one another to work together.

, Avoid excessive highlighting of individuals in a team. Reduce individual competition by establishing group incentives for completing a project. Examples include rewarding teams with half a day off or distributing group gift certificates upon successful completion of a project phase.

, Plan social activities for the team to increase group camaraderie.

Frame conflicts and problems as an opportunity to grow and innovate.,
Institute mandatory brainstorming sessions.,
Give team members a break when they reach an impasse.",How to Develop Guidelines For Team Building in the Workplace5," Emphasize the overall team goal, and explain that a clash of viewpoints is useful because it often allows rich and innovative solutions to emerge.

, As problems arise or on a weekly basis, gather team members to discuss team conflicts, difference of opinions and stumbling blocks.

, If the group cannot devise a solution, encourage team members to momentarily step away from the problem. Solutions sometimes occur to people when their minds are on other things.

Truly engaged business leaders are honest about their company's flaws and take steps to tackle them as opposed to ignoring them or minimizing the complexity of their problems.Conduct a SWOT analysis to address your company's weaknesses honestly. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. Perhaps your company excelled in sales last year, but lost a number of employees to a competing firm. Maybe you had the opportunity to partner with a nationally renowned brand but you lost the partnership due to shareholder pressure.View hiring and recruiting as an opportunity to tackle some of your challenges as opposed to simply filling a need. Identify what goals you have as a company and look to your employees as stakeholders in your company's success.;
, The timing of recruiting might seem unimportant, but it can actually have an important impact on your business. Most employers hire during an upturn in the economy, but research has shown that hiring during a downturn -- a practice called counter-cyclical hiring-- can also help your business.Although you might be most concerned with minimizing costs during a downturn, this period can yield highly qualified applicants who will be a great investment for your company in the long term., Attracting highly qualified talent will require some effort on your part, especially if your company is smaller and not as well known as your competitors. Your job ad should be a broader reflection of your company's values and broader culture.Hook your reader at the beginning. Why is your company a great place to work? What are your core values and in what ways do you value your employees? You can cover this quickly, in just one or two sentences. Lead with this in your posting.
Clearly define the requirements of the job. What kind of work with this person be doing? Will they be working in one specific team, or working with a variety of departments in the business? Will they be writing reports, managing projects, analyzing data, etc.? Will they be required to travel?Revise and update the job description. If you have previously hired for this position, it can be tempting to just plug in the same description you've used for years on your web site or on a job search engine. But take the time to update it. Does the job description reflect the current state of your company? Have you grown since your originally wrote it? Have the demands of the job changed with emerging technologies or a different target market of customers?, Posting the job ad on popular job engine sites like Monster, Glassdoor, Indeed (or OpportunityKnocks and Idealist if you are non-profit) might seems like an obvious place to start, but you should also consider if you have any potential candidates on file already. Has anyone expressed interest in your business or profession when you weren't hiring?Looking at resumes that you have already on file might be helpful because you won't have to sift through hundreds of resumes you will receive when you post the job publicly.
If you belong to a trade association or other professional organization, advertise the job through them as well. Let your network of colleagues at other companies know you are searching for new talent.
Ask your employees if they know of friends or family members who might be interested in the job.

, It can be difficult to get a truly in-depth view of a candidate over the course of an interview. But you should prepare for the interview so you can use it to its fullest potential.Review the candidate's materials (resume, cover letter, writing sample, portfolio, if applicable) before the interview. You can then have a sense of how you will structure your questions and what areas of the candidate's experience you would like to discuss further.
Ask questions to get a sense of the candidate's personality. How have they handled stressful situations? What accomplishments are they proud of? How have they solved complex problems in the past?
Do not ask questions regarding the candidate's age or personal situation (i.e. if they are married or if they have children). These questions are illegal to ask.If you can, try to have other evaluators conduct the interview with you so you can get your colleague's opinions in addition to your own.You might also consider doing pre-screen interviews over the phone or via Skype in order to get a sense of the candidate before you bring them into your office for a secondary interview.

, At each point of the recruiting and hiring process, make sure you have clearly expressed your company's core values and goals. Define what you stand for and what kind of culture you create for your employees.

, The most effective method for doing this is to clearly communicate with your employees instead of withholding important information from them.

Explain the decisions you make with your employees and include their input. If you are taking the company in a new direction or pursuing a different venture, discuss this with them and make sure they know why. This will increase their own investment in the company. , Mentorship programs can have significant benefits for employees, from promoting retention to increasing productivity. Establishing a mentorship program between senior employees and newer hires will help your employees feel connected to the broader goals and values of the company.In addition to providing guidance and advice, mentors can help keep mentees accountable for meeting certain targets or completing different projects., Establish a method of measuring employee performance so you can continuously make accommodating changes in staff, training, resources, or project structure. Keep in mind that developing a workforce is always a work-in-progress.


Make your expectations clear. If you require that your employees reach a certain sales quota or win a minimum number of grants, then make this very clear to them early on in their hiring.Prepare your employees for performance reviews. Do not spring these reviews on employees out of the blue. Instead, you should have a standing date (say, twice every year, one in March and the other in October), so your employees will have time to prepare. Maintaining these forms of internal communication will help your employees contribute their best work to your company.Clearly communicate with your employees when they are not meeting expectations or when they could improve., While you probably have a clear vision for the growth of your company, you should anticipate potential pitfalls or obstacles. Anticipate ways you could restructure departments or merge different roles in the event of significant profit loss., Your employees will get more meaning from their work when they have the freedom to learn more and acquire new skills. Additional training should be positioned as a means to challenge your employees and to trust them with more responsibilities and a broader knowledge set.Encourage your employees to participate in conferences, seminars and even take extra courses or pursue an higher degree in their field.

, Employees are far more likely to thrive in environments where they feel a personal connection to their colleagues and administrators. While you don't have to be close friends with your employees, you should foster an environment where your employees feel comfortable around each other.


In addition to the standard holiday parties, consider having more informal happy hours, bowling nights, or outings to local places such as museums, theaters and sporting events.

, While your first focus is on making a profit and meeting your shareholder's expectations, you should consider the broader social imprint of your company. Valuing social welfare and making a profit are not mutually exclusive goals. Consider participating in corporate philanthropy programs with local non-profits or area foundations.
Establish a volunteer program for employees where they can take a day every quarter to represent your company at a local non-profit.

Administer skills assessments.,
Develop individualized career development plans.,
Balance administrative development goals with other workplace expectations.",How to Develop an Administrative Staff1," Some employers conduct skills testing before hiring employees, but these tests also can be administered with longtime employees, particularly when introducing new computer software applications or company processes.


Clarify the objective of the skills assessment. Letting workers know that the purpose of the skills tests is to assist in designing training programs will alleviate their fears of losing their jobs or being criticized or demoted.;
, Treat each administrative employee as a person with unique strengths and needs. Engage in one-on-one discussions that explore employee goals, needs, challenges and interests.


Create a timeline for skills development. Encourage administrative personnel to accelerate skills enhancement by assigning a deadline for completion of training programs. Skills development timelines are helpful for both the employer and administrative personnel. For example, an executive assistant who achieves advanced mastery of word processing software will potentially benefit from greater productivity and shorter work days.

, Personnel who work long hours, for example, cannot be expected to spend their after hours and weekends in mandatory training programs. Schedule trainings and skills discussions to take place during company downtime.

Keep up to date on your state's law.",How to Draft an Employee Noncompete Agreement," If you don't have a transactional attorney to draft contracts for your business, you typically can find templates online that you can use to create an employee noncompete agreement.Some websites offer basic templates for free, but keep in mind that these templates typically are generic in nature and may not conform to your state's law.
You typically must pay for a form or template agreement designed to be enforceable in a particular state.
You also may be able to find agreements used by other companies that you can use as a guide, but remember to tailor any such agreement to the needs of your business, rather than simply copying it verbatim.;
, Noncompete agreements are unenforceable in some states and extremely restricted in others, so before you start writing your employee noncompete agreement you must make sure it falls within the guidelines of your state law.Noncompete agreements are outright illegal in some states such as California. If the agreement is separate, it simply will not be enforced. However, if your noncompete agreement exists within a larger employment agreement, the presence of the illegal noncompete may void the entire contract.
Many other states such as Texas have laws regarding the interpretation of these agreements that strongly favor employees over employers in the event of a dispute.
You should consult a business attorney if you have any questions as to whether noncompete agreements are enforceable in your state. Attorneys who specialize in business and employment contracts will be up-to-date on any legal trends and have first-hand knowledge of how courts in your area handle noncompete agreements.

, Use the first paragraphs of your agreement to establish the name and place of residence of the employee signing the agreement, as well as your name, your role in the company, and the company's place of business.You also should identify the role of the employee in your company. Keep in mind that many courts won't enforce noncompete agreements signed by low-level employees who can't do anything to seriously harm your business, even if they go to work for a directly competitor.
Briefly describe the nature of your company's business, as well as what the employee will be doing for your business. Stress the unique contributions the employee will make and the level of access they will have to trade secrets or confidential information as a result of their role in the company.

, Since courts already disfavor noncompete agreements, this is not the time to hide the ball. Title your document ""Employee Noncompete Agreement"" and restate in the introduction what type of agreement it is.This also ensures that the employee knows up-front what type of agreement they are signing.
Typically you want a noncompete agreement that is separate from any other employment agreement, and made with its own separate consideration.
A separate agreement protects any other contracts between you and the employee in the event your state law changes or a court declines to enforce the noncompete agreement.

, Courts treat noncompete agreements less harshly when it is clear that the employer has a significant and legitimate business interest they are seeking to protect.Be specific about the harm that will come to your company if the agreement is violated, and what you want to protect.
A legitimate purpose for a noncompete agreement would be to keep someone from taking advantage of your employee training to learn how to operate that type of business efficiently, then using all that information to open their own business and compete with you directly.
Moving to a pre-existing business already in direct competition with you is another threat. However, you must be careful to state your purpose clearly. You typically cannot restrict an employee from moving to another employer in a similar, but not identical, business.
Beyond protecting key trade secrets, the agreement should emphasize the time and effort that you've put into research and development of your business.
A noncompete agreement should be designed to safeguard that investment, and keep someone else3 from unduly profiting off the time and effort you've put into learning your industry and carving out your place in it.
Keep in mind that the noncompete agreement generally should be the least restrictive means of protecting your business interest. If there is some other way your business interest could be protected without restricting the actions of an employee after they've left your company, a noncompete agreement is not legally appropriate.

, Being specific rather than using vague categories increases the chance that your agreement will be enforceable, and provides the employee with the guidance they need to avoid disclosing sensitive information and inadvertently violating the agreement.Require the employee to promptly return any manuals, client lists, or other company documents to you without copying them.
Include specific activities prohibited to the employee after they leave. These activities should be limited to those that would obviously harm your business in a significant way. #*For example, you might prohibit an employee from soliciting your clients, attempting to hire your employees, or starting up a new business that directly competes with yours.
You don't want to prohibit the employee from engaging in too many activities. Think about the relationship of the activity to the business interest you're seeking to protect through the noncompete agreement, and only include activities that have a close nexus to that interest.

, Industries are dynamic, and information that could have been detrimental to your business if disclosed five years ago is probably irrelevant now. Your employee noncompete agreement shouldn't last any longer than the information has value.The length of time an employee noncompete agreement's restrictions last is one of the most important factors to judges when they determine whether the agreement is reasonable and should be enforced.
If you have restrictions lasting longer than necessary, a judge may refuse to enforce the agreement at all.
For example, if you impose restrictions lasting five years, a judge may rule the agreement is unenforceable and let your former employee of the hook for a breach – even if you brought your lawsuit only six months after they left your company.
Typically, judges will consider your noncompete agreement reasonable if restrictions only last between six months and two years.
However, reasonable duration also depends on the facts of the case. You may have different durations for different restrictions within the same agreement depending on the length of time the information has value, or that activity would have a significant impact on your business.
For example, if you have a restriction prohibiting the use of a confidential client list, its duration may be longer than a restriction that prohibits the employee from going to work for a direct competitor.
Stealing your clients would have a serious detrimental impact on your business, regardless of whether it took place six months or six years after the employee left your company.
Generally, narrower, more specific restrictions can have a longer duration. However, restrictions that broadly limit a former employee's activities should have a shorter duration.

, While it's understandable that you wouldn't want a former employee to open up a shop across the street and use all your secrets against you, if they move to a company in the same industry located in another state, it's unlikely anything they do will actually affect your bottom line.Be specific with geographic limitations, and provide names of locations rather than general areas. If you intend to restrict the employee's ability to work for a direct competitor in the cities or counties in which you do business, name those places specifically.
Keep in mind that courts typically won't enforce an agreement that purports to restrict an employee's activities in an area where you don't do business when the agreement is signed. It doesn't matter if your growth plans include expansion to that area.
If you have written growth plans in place, you may want to create zones with varying degrees of restrictions. This can tie in to the duration for which restrictions will be in effect.
For example, the employee may be restricted from going to work for a direct competitor in the same city for three years, and from going to work for a direct competitor elsewhere in the same state for one year.

, You must go to court to enforce the contract if the employee breaches it, but specifying penalties in the document itself can lessen the chances of your lawsuit getting thrown out.This same portion of the agreement also should state which court is the proper venue for any lawsuits for breach of the agreement, as well as which state's law will be used to interpret the agreement. #*When you make your choice of law, avoid the temptation of using the laws of a state that are more liberal or friendly to noncompete agreements than the state in which you do business. If you have no legitimate ties to that state, a court may rule that choice of law invalid.
Employee noncompete agreements typically specify injunctive relief as the remedy for breach. This means the court can order the employee to stop engaging in whatever activities violate the noncompete agreement they signed with you.
You also can include specific monetary damages to which you are entitled for breach, but keep in mind that courts tend to look on these statements with more hostility. You're already potentially putting the person out of work with a court injunction – asking them to pay you money on top of that can be seen as unreasonable.

, Employee noncompete agreements are contracts like any other, and must be supported by valid consideration or they are not enforceable in a court of law. If the noncompete agreement is not signed as a condition of employment, you must offer the employee something else in exchange for their signature.Typically you must offer the employee money, or additional stock options, in exchange for their signature on an employee noncompete agreement.
This consideration is more likely to be considered valid if it has value in proportion to the value of the restriction, or the activities the employee is being asked to give up.
Providing separate consideration for the noncompete agreement increases the chances that if a court finds the noncompete agreement unenforceable, other contracts or agreements you've made with the employee will remain enforceable.

, Different employees have access to different information and could potentially damage the company in different ways. Courts are more skeptical of agreements that seem to be made of generic boilerplate signed by every employee.Analyze carefully the position of each employee you want to sign an employee noncompete agreement. Although you may have a basic form agreement, you should not include any restrictions in an individual agreement that don't apply to that employee or reflect their role in your company.
Keep in mind that the purpose of the agreement is to protect your company's valuable information, and the investment you've put into building and growing your company – not to punish employees for leaving you.
Make sure each agreement is drafted narrowly to reflect the training the employee receives, the information to which they'll have access, and the role they have in your company.

, Not every employee is going to damage your business if they go to work for a competitor – even one located across the street from you. Good judgment dictates only requiring a noncompete agreement when absolutely necessary.For example, if you own an ice cream shop, you may have a legitimate business interest in protecting your ice cream recipes and your ingredient lists.
However, a court is unlikely to uphold an employee noncompete agreement you have every teenaged cashier sign before they come work for you part time at minimum wage.
Courts are much more likely to understand an employee's ability to significantly damage your business if they are someone who has a large stake in the growth and development of your company.

, Because judges are generally opposed to noncompete agreements, the law on what is and is not enforceable in a given state may change frequently, necessitating changes to your employee noncompete agreement.Keep track of the employee noncompete agreements you have, and review them at least once a year.
Compare your agreement to any recent cases in the state appeals or supreme court to ensure they remain valid and enforceable.
If you discover that an employee noncompete agreement signed in the past is no longer enforceable, assess the situation. You may want to consider having the employee sign another noncompete agreement that you've modified to comport with the law as it currently applies.
Keep in mind that any modified agreement signed must be supported by additional consideration to be a valid legal contract.

If your hair is straight, you will want a volumizing shampoo/conditioner to minimize flatness.
If your hair is course, kinky, or damaged you will want a shampoo/conditioner that can treat damage, detangle, and soften.;
, You will need shampoo, conditioner, a towel, a comb, and a cup. You will also need a sink, and possibly a step stool. A few extra towels are always a good idea.

, Prepare yourself for hair washing by rolling up your sleeves, or even taking off your shirt.You may also want to place a towel around your neck.

, You'll want a sink that is large enough to fit your head under the faucet. You'll also want a sink that is a good height for you to bend over into (a sink that sits at your belly button will be perfect). If your sink has a sprayer, that is an added benefit!


Use a step stool if your sink is too high.
Kitchen sinks tend to be larger and more commonly have sprayers. For this reason, kitchen sinks usually work best.

, Let the water run until it is warm. You want the water to be nice and comfortable, but not too hot., Bend over into the sink. Flip your hair over so that the back of your neck is exposed. Get your head as far under the running faucet as you can. Then, using the sink sprayer and/or your cup, pour additional water on your hair until the back is completely saturated. Warm water is the best choice for this step., Turn your face from side to side, placing each side of your head under the running faucet. Then, using the sink sprayer and/or your cup, pour additional water on the sides of your head until they are completely saturated.

, Cup your hands under the running water and splash water onto the hair above your forehead. By now, all of the hair on your head should be saturated.

Purchase a UV light pen.,
Filter the water.,
Turn on the light pen.,
Submerge the pen and stir.,
Dry the bottle threads before drinking.",How to Use UV to Sanitize Water1," Ultraviolet light pens for water sterilization can be found online or at your local outdoor store. There are a few different models to choose from depending on what you are looking for. Things to consider are the amount of water you need to sterilize and the weight of the device.


If you are using the UV light pen as your main sterilization while backpacking, make sure you have a secondary system (purification tablets or drops) in case the UV pen fails or runs out of battery power.;
, Before using a UV light pen, you must ensure that your water is clear and free of particulate matter. This can easily be done by pouring the water through a piece of cloth such as a bandana. This will collect the dirt and result in clear water.This step does no sterilization other than removing dirt from the water. It still must be sterilized with the UV light.
In an emergency, you can double the treatment time to sterilize cloudy water.

, Turning on the pen will depend on the specific model that you own, but it will likely be a button or switch. Different buttons will designate the amount of water you are purifying. There will be settings specific to half of a liter and one liter. It is not recommended to purify more than one liter of water at a time.Once the pen is on, you can place it in the water bottle.

, Submerge the lamp of the pen in the water and stir it around. The agitation of the water is important to ensure complete inactivation of any microorganisms present. If you do not see light coming from the lamp, the pen has not been properly activated is or is not working.Always carry a backup water purification system in case one fails.
Keep the pen submerged until the light goes off. The pen has a timer based on the amount of water you are purifying and will shut off automatically.

, If you obtained the water from a stream, any microorganisms from that stream will still be in the water remaining on the threads of the bottle. The UV light pen will not sterilize these organisms, but if you simply dry the bottle off before drinking, you will be fine.Use a clean, dry cloth to dry off the bottle.

Leave the band aide on for 24 to 48 hours.,
Remove the band aide after 24 to 48 hours.",How to Use Tea Tree Oil1," Some people may be allergic to tea tree oil. Doing a skin patch test will help you determine whether or not you are allergic to tea tree oil.


If you are planning on using tea tree oil as an air freshener, room spray, or cleaner, then you don't have to do a skin patch test.

, This carrier oil can be any food grade oil, such as: almond, coconut, olive, sunflower, or sweet almond. You can also use jojoba or Argan oil as a carrier oil., The band aide will help keep the area moist and prevent the oils from evaporating., Do not allow the band aide to get wet during this time. If you start feeling pain, burning, itchiness, or discomfort at any point during this time, remove the band aide immediately. Wash the area with warm soap and water. You are likely allergic to tea tree oil and should not use it on your skin., If you don't notice any irritation, you probably are not allergic to tea tree oil and can use it on your skin.

Tell management about poorly maintained restrooms/leaks.,
Bring your own toilet paper.,
Keep your own seat protectors.,
Bring alternate hand and body sanitation items.,
Take a probiotic.",How to Use a Public Restroom," When you first enter a public restroom, take a quick survey of the available stalls. Make a smart choice on what stall to use.Choose a stall that seems the cleanest. The toilet should be flushed, the seat should be dry and free of any visible debris and there should be toilet paper and seat protectors.
Many times one or two stalls may be visible dirty or contaminated. These stalls should be avoided if possible.
If your only option is to use a dirtier or unclean stall, use more precaution and employ as many safe use practices as possible.;
, There is actually more chance of spreading bacteria or getting bacteria on you when you flush the toilet.Be careful and mindful when flushing public restroom toilets.


When a toilet is flushed, the ""spray zone"" can be up to 6 feet. If you're in the stall and flush, you're right in the middle of that zone.
Use toilet paper to touch the handle. Avoid using your bare hand to flush the toilet. Use some toilet paper or use your foot to flush.In addition, face away from the toilet when you flush. That way your face and mouth are not facing the toilet and will be away from the spray zone.
Use toilet paper to open the door. It stands to reason that the inside latch of the toilet door is dirtier than the outside latch. Use a small piece of toilet paper to open it with and dispose of this paper immediately in the bin upon exiting.

, Washing your hands is probably one of the most important parts of using a public restroom. And unfortunately, many times the sink is the germiest place in the restroom.Wash your hands in the warmest water available or that is comfortable to you. The hot water helps sanitize your hands.Wash your hands using soap for at least 20 seconds under running water, (Happy birthday song twice). , After you wash your hands, it's important to continue your safe hand washing practice with appropriate hand drying practices. You can still come into contact with germs when you're drying your hands.


Ideally, the bathroom will have paper towels. If this is an option, also turn off the faucet with a paper towel. Use a separate towel to dry your hands and open the door of the bathroom to exit.Studies show that some hand dryers blow water back towards your face. In addition, other hand dryers catch water at the bottom of the drying unit and blow that collected water back up towards the user.If a hand dryer is the only method of drying your hands, follow the use of these machines by rubbing your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer., When you're leaving the restroom, you should still be wary of germs that you could come in contact with.


Remember, although you washed your hands, others may not have. There is still a significant amount of germs on the door and handle of the restroom.Use a small square of toilet paper or hand-drying paper to open the door that leads out of the toilets. It may sound finicky but after all your hard efforts to wash your hands, continue without coming in contact with more germs.
Also consider following up your bathroom break by using a hand sanitizer. This can help remove any additional germs you may have picked up.

, If you're a mom or dad that has to change their baby's diaper in a public restroom, there are some additional precautions and tips to help keep your baby safe.


Always have a changing pad and blanket with you. You can lay these down on the changing table, or if there isn't one, on a nearby bench or chair.
It may also be a good idea to keep extra wipes or baby approved sanitizers with you.

, Most companies or local authorities are responsible for managing public restroom facilities and want to be told when their toilets are in disarray. Complaints from consumers do matter.


Contact the building staff or appropriate management team and let them know that the restroom should be checked and cleaned.
If you don't get a response or the standard doesn't lift, contact your local health department and lodge a complaint.

, Unfortunately, the toilet paper in public restrooms may not be as clean or safe as you think. Remove the first two layers of toilet paper to help reduce germs.Health experts say that when a toilet is flushed, some water and germs are sprayed into the air. This spray can be far reaching in the stall and can land on a variety of areas including the toilet paper.Removing the first two layers of toiler paper can help reduce how many germs you come into contact with. Throw them into the toilet before you sit down.
You can also keep your own toilet paper in a plastic baggie in your purse or pocket so you do not have to use the paper provided in the bathroom.

, Studies have shown that although there are plenty of germs on the seat of the toilet, your skin is an incredibly effective barrier and keeps those germs from entering your body.


However, using the seat protectors that are provided can help you feel better and safer when you sit on the seat.
Again, when the toilet is flushed, the water and germs in the toilet can be sprayed on the provided seat protectors. Get rid of the first one available and throw away in the toilet.Many pharmacies and outdoor stores now carry tiny packs of toilet seat covers and it can't hurt to toss a pack into your handbag or backpack to take wherever you go.

, It might be a good idea to invest in some hand sanitizer to keep with you when you use a public restroom.


You are not guaranteed to have safe hand washing facilities in public restrooms so having a back up plan is helpful.
Carry a waterless hand sanitizer with you. You can use it after you've washed your hands and exited the rest room, for an extra precaution.

, Although taking a daily probiotic isn't something you'd think would help with staying germ-free in a public restrooms, health experts actually think this can help.


Studies have shown that the more beneficial and healthy bacteria or microbes you have in your gut, the better ability your body has to fight off foreign pathogens.Taking a daily probiotic might be helpful especially if you have to use a public restroom on a regular basis.
Take a probiotic that has at least 10 billion CFUs (colony forming units) each day. This amount is generally contained in one pill or tablet."

Learn the benefits of ultraviolet sanitization.,
Choose a device for your home.,
Install the purification system.,
Maintain your UV system.",How to Use UV to Sanitize Water2," UV light is a better purification system because it is also effective against chlorine-resistant microorganisms that may not be cleared by the municipal water system. Using UV is easy to use, extremely effective (kills 99.9% of microorganisms), and produces no harmful by-products.UV light is most effective in clear water where the light waves can penetrate into the water, killing all of the microbes.
An at-home UV system is easy to use because it connects directly to the water pipes of your home. It purifies the water as it flows through your faucets.

, The type of purification system you choose to install is dependent upon the needs of your house. The main things to consider when choosing a system are the quality and flow rate of the incoming water. You also need to consider whether you want just one faucet purified or the whole house.If the flow rate of the incoming water is too fast, the water will not be properly sterilized.
The water must be clear for UV to work effectively, so choose a system that combines a filter with the UV purification.
Housing of the device should be made of stainless steel to protect electronics from corrosion.
Choose a system that has an audible alarm to alert you when the light needs changed or if the system is failing.

, Whichever system you choose, install the purification device according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The system will either be attached directly to the pipes near a single faucet in your house or will be attached to the main pipe that brings water into your home. Alternatively, you can have someone come in and install it themselves. If you are unsure about how to do it, ask for help or a demonstration to make sure it is done properly.


Install the system in a location that is close to the water faucet. UV light is only effective for the water that passes through it. If that water then carries on through the contaminated pipes, it will become contaminated again. Installing it close to the source and occasionally cleaning your pipes prevents this from happening.The water flows directly through the purification system, so you don’t need to worry about doing anything once the device is installed.

, The UV lamp is the most essential part of the system. UV lamps do not burn out, but over time they lose intensity. As a general rule, the lamp will need to be replaced about once a year. If you have a system with an alarm, it will alert you when it is time to replace the bulb. It is also recommended to clean the glass around the lamp that may have collected mineral deposits.If the lamp intensity decreases too much, it will no longer be effective against microorganisms and your water will not be sterilized. You can use a UV light intensity meter to determine when your lamp needs to be replaced.
Anything that will obstruct the light from reaching the water will decrease the effectiveness of your system.

Obtain a clear, plastic water bottle.,
Filter the water.,
Lay the bottle in the sun for at least six hours.",How to Use UV to Sanitize Water3," For this to work properly, you must use a clear and clean plastic water bottle. It is recommended that the plastic be “PET” (polyethylene terephthalate). You can identify this type of plastic because it will have a recycle number of 1 on the bottle. The bottle should be no larger than two liters.PET is a very common plastic used in the manufacture of most soft drink and water bottles.
The bottle should not be colored at all.

, In order to sanitize the water with UV from the sun, the water itself must be clear. If there is any sediment in it, the UV will be less effective. Place a cloth over the top of the bottle and pour the water through the cloth. This will capture any sediment and make the water clear.This filtering step will not sterilize or purify your water, it will just remove the solid particles that may be suspended in the water.

, The sun emits UV rays and therefore can be used for sanitization. The absolute minimum amount of time required for sterilization is six hours. This is the minimum for a bright, sunny day. Most microorganisms will be killed in this amount of time with the exception being cryptosporidium (10 hours is recommended). If the sky is partly cloudy or half-filled with clouds it can take up to two days for sterilization to be complete.Make sure the bottle is on its side and not standing upright. This will maximize the UV exposure.
Increase UV exposure by placing the bottles on top of a reflective surface such as foil.
