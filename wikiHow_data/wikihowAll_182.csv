Making a fish pattern on your Rubik’s cube is simple. The end result will have swapped two edge pieces so that the remaining ones look like a fish with fins. If you hold the cube diagonally it will look like a fish swimming away from you., Start with the white surface facing you. Then, turn the front face of the cube by 180 degrees (two clicks). Now, take the right side and twist it 180 degrees as well., Keep the white cube in front of you and again twist the front of it 180 degrees. Turn the right side, then the front face, and the right side one more time. Always keep the white face in front of you by making sure the center cube of the face is white.

, When you are finished, you should see a fish shape that looks as though it is swimming away. The four center pieces are its body and the three remaining are the fins."

",How to Create a Cube Pattern Within a Rubik's Cube," Make sure all faces have the right color, and then hold the cube with the RED side facing you and the GREEN side on top.;
, The front side is the RED side facing you.

, The left side is the YELLOW side with the BLUE vertical line.


The color of the center piece on each side indicates the color of that whole face.

, This step is exactly like step two.


At this point, you should have formed a 2 by 2 by 3 cube in the back right corner of the cube.

, The top side is the GREEN side, with the GREEN center piece.

, The right side is the WHITE side with the white center piece.


Make sure you're still holding the cube with the RED side facing you and the GREEN side on top.

, This motion is the opposite of that done in step 5.

, Make sure you move the front side twice in order to end up with a red, green, and white 2 by 2 by 2 cube in the right corner that's facing you.

,


At this point, you should have created the first cube, and you should have the two vertical green lines on the top and a red vertical line in the left column of the top face.

, Keep the cube in this position throughout Part 2.

, The left side is now the GREEN side because you are holding the cube differently.

, Remember to keep holding the cube with the orange side facing you and the yellow side on top as you perform each step.

,


You might feel like you are messing up the order, but it will all start coming together in the next few steps.

, The motion you perform for the right side is basically the opposite of what you do for the left side.

, Double check your work by comparing your cube's orientation with the one in the images.

, Make sure you perform this motion twice.


At this point, you could see that the 2 by 2 by 2 cube yellow, blue, and orange forming in the front right corner.

, You should now see two 2 by 2 by 2 cubes in two corners.

Before an UNO match, go through the deck and find a wild card draw four.,
Hide it in your pocket.,
Say that the other person can deal, and then grab a card once the person deals it to you.

,
On one of the cards, ""accidentally"" drop it on the floor.,
Bend down to pretend you're picking up, then slip the wild card draw four into your deck.

,
Try to keep it until the end instead of using it right away; you will most likely win if you do it this way.

",How to Cheat at UNO1,";
, If you're not wearing any pockets, hide it in between your legs when you sit down to play UNO. This is easier if you play at a table.

,, Say you dropped one, and instead of picking up the one that you dropped, pick up the wild card draw four.

Start at number 1.,
Note that if two boxes in a block, column or row must be one of two numbers, you can use those numbers to eliminate other possibilities.,
Recognize that hard Sudokus can take time - a lot of time.,
Consider this alternative, surefire way to always solve a puzzle accurately and quickly.",How to Solve a Sudoku2," Use the same logic from an easy puzzle to fill in every empty box with all of the possible numbers for that box. If possible, put in definites. For example, picture three (above) shows that you can't solve for 3.


In a hard Sudoku, you won't be able to solve from the start, so just fill in what you know it could be. This will help later when you have two or three options per box and you can't remember what they are.

, For example, in a block, there are four open boxes. From your analysis, you have determined that:


box A can be 1, 2, 3, or 4;
box B can be 1, 2, 3, or 4;
box C can be 3 or 4; and
box D can be 3 or 4.
From this we know that box A and B cannot be 3 or 4, because they have to be either 1 or 2. Box C and D have to be either 3 or 4. This information might be useful in solving other boxes.



, A hard Sudoku can actually take days to complete, but they are still fun. The harder they are, the more fun it is when you finish. A hard Sudoku can be solved the same as an easy one, it just gives you less to start with. The logic of a hard puzzle is that if you know everything that can go in every box, it is very simple.


For example, say you have two possible 2's for a particular nine-square box, and they are in a row or column and you know that 2's cannot go anywhere else in the nine-square box. This means that you know that the row or column those 2's are in cannot have 2's in it except in this nine-square box. This sounds confusing, but when applied, it is actually very easy and it helps a lot.

, In this method, fill in each block with all the possible numbers that could go there. Write all the numbers small at the top of the block. You can recreate the puzzle on bigger paper to help with this. Write all the numbers that don't appear in that row, column or square. Once you have done this for a whole column or row, start filling in the obvious answers. You will have solved the puzzle by the time you do this for every row.

Be a confident and advanced Sudoku player.,
Keep the connections in sight.,
Look at the lines.,
Solve just as you would a regular puzzle.",How to Solve a Sudoku3," The Samurai Sudoku puzzle is a puzzle only to be attempted by a skilled Sudoku solver. It is basically five Sudokus in one. The corners of each are interconnected with a middle puzzle (see image below). These puzzles can be long and difficult.

, When solving these, you must always remember that the corner connected with the center puzzle must work with both puzzles.

, The lines that are twenty-one boxes long are going to be looked at as if there were three separate nine block lines, one of which is comprised of pieces of the other two.

, Just remember that you can have up to three of the same number in lines that connect to the center puzzle.

Take a look at the killer variant of the samurai Sudoku.,
Look within each of the colored blocks for a small number.,
Notice that within each colored block, a number may be repeated, although this is rare.

,
Note the total.,
Realize that in a Killer Samurai puzzle there are 4 instances where 3 x 3 grids belong to two different nine square blocks.,
Look for colored blocks which contain high or low totals.,
Look for a group of colored blocks which protrude beyond the boundary of the nine square blocks by one square only.,
Don't just think of a single block totaling 45.,
Look for intersecting colored blocks with high or low totals.,
Look to eliminate 'pairs'.,
Look for colored blocks that form 'lines'.,
Be aware of 2 square combinations.,
Be aware of 3 square combinations.,
Try less advanced Sudoku before moving on to Killer Samurai Sudoku.",How to Solve a Sudoku4," The rules are a bit different, and the grid now involves color. The standard Sudoku rules apply to this puzzle as well, i.e. each nine square box has to have the numbers 1-9
, This denotes the total value of the squares within that block. For example, if a colored block comprising 3 squares totals 7, then the individual squares must be 1, 2 and 4, but it is down to the reader to ascertain in which order they must be placed.

,, Each nine square block must total 45, as must every row and column.

, In this situation the same rules of Sudoku apply, i.e. the numbers 1 – 9 must be used once only. It stands to reason that these 4 grids can hold the key to solving the entire puzzle.

, These have fewer combinations of numbers and are, as such, easier to solve.

, This will allow the reader to determine at least one square of a colored block.

, It may sometimes be possible to ascertain a number by adding colored blocks in 2, 3, 4 or more nine square blocks totaling 90, 135, 180 etc to ascertain a single elusive number.

, For example, where a colored block totaling 3 is at 90 degrees to a colored block totaling 4, the values of the blocks should be easy to work out as there is only a choice of 3 numbers; 1, 2 and 3, but don`t forget that each row and column must contain the numbers 1 – 9 once only.

, If a colored block of 2 squares totals 4, 6, 8 etc., logic tells you that the numbers contained within cannot be 2 & 2, 3 & 3 and 4 & 4 etc. thus reducing the permutations.

, For example, if 4 colored blocks of 2 squares form a line, then the missing number can be calculated by deducting the total from 45.

, These include:

, These include:

, Killer Samurai Sudoku is an advanced variant of Sudoku and it is highly recommended that you try to complete a normal and also Samurai Sudoku before undertaking these more complex puzzles. These are extremely hard puzzles. They may take days to complete. Just have patience.

Break tiebreakers when slapping.",How to Play Slap With an Uno Deck," Slap is usually played with a 52 card deck. Uno decks have 108 cards, with different suits and colors. You can pair down the Uno deck to 52 cards with a few simple alterations.


Uno cards have four suits: blue, green, red, and yellow. Each suit has 10 cards with numbers going from 0 to 9. Keep the four suits numbered 0 to 9 as part of your Slap deck.
Get rid of the Wild Draw Four Cards and the Wild Cards. You do not need these to play Slap as they cannot stand in for cards in a traditional deck.
Uno has 8 ""Draw Two"" cards. There are 2 ""Draw 2"" cards for each color suit. You only need 4 ""Draw Two"" cards to play Slap, so remove one ""Draw 2"" card from each color. Add these to your Slap deck and set the rest of the ""Draw 2"" cards aside.
Uno has 8 ""Reverse Cards"" and 8 ""Skip Cards,"" with two cards of each color in the deck. As with the ""Draw Two"" cards, you only need four ""Skip Cards"" and four ""Reverse Cards."" Remove a ""Skip Card"" and a ""Reverse Card"" of each color. Add these to your Slap deck and set the other cards aside.
When you're finished, you should have 52 cards. Your deck should contain 40 numbered colored cards, with 10 cards for each color. You should have four ""Draw Two"" cards in each color, four ""Reverse Cards"" in each color, and four ""Skip Cards"" in each color.;
, In Slap, there are certain rules regarding Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jokers. You'll need to pick a type of card to stand in for an ace, a king, a queen, and a joker from your Uno deck.


In a regular card deck, you have 10 cards per suit. Each suit has one ace, as well as a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. In your Uno deck, it makes sense to count the ""0"" cards as aces.
You can count Draw Two cards as Kings, Reverse Card as Queens, and Skip Cards as Jokers. However, there are no strict rules regarding what Uno cards count as what type of traditional deck cards. If you want to, say, count Reverse Cards as Kings and Draw Two Cards as Queens, you can do this as well. Just make sure all players are on the same page regarding what the non-numbered cards represent in your Uno deck.

, There is no limit to how many people can play Slap. Cards are sometimes uneven when dealt, and players will expect as much going in. There's no need to make sure the number of players is exactly divisible by 52. You can have as many players as can comfortably fit around a table. Once players are assembled, shuffle your altered deck of Uno cards.


There is no set rule for how long to shuffle the deck. However, some folklore dictates shuffling the deck 7 times will yield the most random results.To deal out cards, hand out cards until the deck is gone. Go in a circle, giving one card at a time to each player. Set the card face down in front of each player. Keep circling until there are no more cards in the deck. As stated, the deck may end up uneven and some players may have slightly more cards.

, From here, players should assemble their cards to prepare to start the game. Players do not get to look at their deck in Slap. Each player should form a neat stack with his or her cards, keeping all the cards face down., Slap is a fast-paced game. Essentially, you go in a circle and each player quickly lays down a card. To start, the player to the left of the dealer removes a card from the deck. This player will set this card face up in the center of the circle of players.In Slap, you move to the left. After the first player sets down his or her card, the next player to left sets down a card.
The game continues like this until a non-numbered card, or a 0 card, is played. In the event of a non-numbered card or a 0 card, there are special rules that must be followed that can allow a player to win cards. The object of Slap is to win all the cards in the deck.

, One way to win cards is to slap the pile of cards in the center. If certain sequences of cards are played, you can slap the deck. The player who slaps the deck first gets to keep the cards in the center of the circle. You can slap the deck under the following conditions:If two cards of the same number are laid down consecutively, you can slap the deck. For example, say you play a Green 5. The player to the left of you then plays a Yellow 5. It's appropriate to slap the deck to try and win the cards.
You can also slap in the event of what's called a ""sandwich."" This occurs when two cards of the same number are laid down with one card of a different number between them. For example, say you play a yellow four. The next player plays a blue seven. The following player plays a red four. You can slap the deck, as the two fours are sandwiching the seven.
When two cards played in a row add up to 10, you can slap the deck. For example, if someone plays a 7, and the next player plays a 3, you can slap the deck.
When four numbered cards are played in a row that go in ascending or descending value, you can slap the deck. For example, you could slap the deck in the event the cards 1, 2, 3, and then 4 were played. You can also slap the deck in the event the cards 4, 3, 2, and then 1 were played.

, In a regular deck of cards, aces, Kings, Queens, and Jokers are known as face cards. In Slap, 0 cards, Draw Two's, Reverse Cards, and Skip Cards will be your designated face cards. There are special protocol regarding face cards when playing Slap.When a face card is played, the next player must draw another face card from his or her deck. With 0 cards, you have four chances to lay down another face card. If you do not produce a face card after drawing four cards, the player to your right collects all the cards in the center of the circle.This can be confusing in the abstract, so look at this example. Say the player to your right plays a 0 card. It is now your turn to play a card. You have four chances to draw another face card (meaning a 0 card, a Draw Two card, a Reverse Card, or a Skip Card) from your deck. The first card you draw is a 6. You then draw a 7. Then, you draw a Reverse Card. As you've matched the face card, the game can move on as normal. The player to your left would play another card from his or her deck.
However, say you played a six, a two, a four, and a seven. You've had your four chances to match the face card and failed. The player to your right, who originally drew the 0, will take all the cards from the center of the deck.

, If you're counting Draw Two cards as Kings, you have 3 chances to match them to prevent the player to your right from collecting the cards. Draw Two cards are also face cards and must also be matched with another face card.Let's look at an example. The player to your right draws a Draw Two card. Now, you have three chances to match it and block this player from gaining the cards. Say you play a 3, and then a Skip Card. You've matched the card, and the game can continue as normal.
However, say you draw a 3, then a 4, and then a 5. You have not matched the face card. The player to your right collects the cards in the center.

, Reverse Cards count as Queens. With Reverse Cards, you have 2 chances to match the card before the player to your right can collect the cards in the center.For example, the player to your right lays down a Reverse Card. Now, you have two chances to match. If you play a 2, and then a 0, you have matched the card. The player to your right does not get to collect the cards, and the game continues.
However, say you draw a 2 and then a 7. You have not matched the card with another face card. The player to your right collects the cards.

, With a Skip Card, you only have one chance to match the card with another face card. If the player to your right plays a Skip Card, you will need to immediately play a 0, a Draw Two Card, a Reverse Card, or another Skip Card to block this player from collecting the cards. If you play another face card, the game continues. If you fail to play a face card, the player to your right collects the cards., In the event a face card is not matched, the player who played the face card collects all the cards in the deck. The player who slaps the deck first at an appropriate time also collects the cards. In these cases, you'll need to start a new round. Whoever won the previous round by collecting all the cards will start the new round. This player will take a card from the top of his or her deck and place it in the center of the circle., Slap can take a long time, especially if you're playing with many people. You will have to continue playing until one player gains all 52 cards. Remember, cards can be gained by playing face cards or by slapping the deck at the appropriate moment., Slap is a fast-paced game. Once all the players have the hang of it, slapping may happen fast. Make sure you know how to determine a tie breaker if you cannot tell who slapped the cards first.Award the cards to whoever has the most fingers on top.
If you can't tell who has the most fingers on top, you can have the competing players draw their hands back. Then, count to three, and allow the players to reach for the cards again. Whoever slaps first this time will win the cards.

Divide the small squares into 3x3 grids.,
Trace the pencil lines with marker.,
Copy or scan your blank puzzle.,
Print out a template.",How to Create a Sudoku1," To make a Sudoku puzzle, you’ll need a pencil, a marker, a ruler and a sheet of standard printer paper. You’ll use the pencil for the first few steps so that you can erase any mistakes, while the ruler will help keep your grid even., Using your pencil and ruler, draw a large square. The square should be about 5”x5”, but you can make it larger or smaller if you like. Also, if you have a Sudoku book handy, consider tracing an existing puzzle to get a standard shape and size., Again using your pencil, divide the large outer square into 9 smaller squares. There should be three squares on the top row, three in the middle row and three in the bottom row: three equally spaced lines going across the square, and three equally spaced lines going down the square. Make sure you use a ruler to ensure that your lines are straight., Once you’ve divided the square into 9 smaller squares, you’ll need to divide those squares into even smaller grids. Using your pencil and ruler, draw three equally spaced lines across each square, then three equally spaced lines down each square. Look at an existing Sudoku puzzle if you need a reference.

, It’s easy to rub away pencil, and you don’t want your board to fade away. Trace the lines you drew with a marker or pen, making sure that the lines of the first 3x3 square are thicker and bolder. The lines of the smaller squares should be light and thin, so consider using a ballpoint pen.

, You may want to make more than one Sudoku puzzle, and you can save the hassle of having to redraw the board. Simply scan or photocopy the board and create some duplicates. Use a scanner at home or make a trip to a copy shop or library to use a photocopier.

, If you don’t want to draw your puzzle-grid by hand, find a template online. Many websites provide grids of different sizes, and you can even find one on this page. Print as many copies of your templates as you think you’ll need."

There should be 25 of each color: blue, yellow, red, and green. In addition, there are four Wild cards and four Wild Draw Four cards.Each color ""suit"" contains:


One 0 card
Two 1 cards, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s and 9s
Two ""Draw Two"" cards; two ""Skip"" cards; and two ""Reverse"" cards.
Four blank cards of each color, if you're using a new deck. Do not use these cards except to replace cards that you lose.;
, If you have fewer players, you'll deal more cards apiece; if you have more players, you'll deal fewer cards apiece. For 2-4 players, deal seven or eight cards per person. If you have 5-8 players, deal six or seven cards apiece. No matter how many players you have, make sure everyone has the same number of cards.If you have more than eight players, you may want to split into two games, or play with teams. The game does not work as well when each player only starts with four or five cards.

, Place the shuffled deck face-down on the table. Have each player pull one card from the top of the deck. Whoever pulls the card with the highest number gets to go first. Power-up cards (e.g. Draw Two, Draw For, and Wild) are worth zero at this stage.Once you decide who goes first, put the drawn cards back into the deck. Reshuffle once more before you deal the cards.
You can also roll a die, if you have one handy, or use any other method to do decide who goes first. Try letting the person with the next birthday go first, or the youngest person at the table. The method doesn't terribly matter as long as you all agree.

To win sudoku, the player must fill the grid so that each row contains the number 1-9, each column contains the numbers 1-9 and each 3x3 box contains the numbers 1-9.Start filling in the number 1. Place a number one in each 3x3 box, each row and each column. Make sure that that you don’t place two number ones in any column, row or 3x3 box.
Move on to the number 2. Begin to place the number 2 in each column, row and 3x3 square. As with the number one, make sure you don’t double up your number 2s.
Continue with each number consecutively. Keep adding the number 3, the number 4 and so on to each row, column and 3x3 box. As you fill in more numbers, the boxes will become easier to fill because you’ll have fewer and fewer spaces left.

, Creating your solution might become frustrating. You can easily back yourself into a corner, where you’ll find that you can only fill a row or column with a duplicate number. If you end up stuck, erase a few of the problem digits and start the section over again.

, Make sure that your solution is correct by checking for duplicate numbers. It may take a while to go through each 3x3 block, row and column, but make sure that they each contain the numbers 1-9 with no duplicate digits.

Erase blank squares and ink filled ones.,
Copy and share your puzzle.",How to Create a Sudoku3," With an eraser, begin by erasing one number from each column, row and 3x3 square. The more you erase, the harder the puzzle will be to solve, so think about how difficult you want the puzzle to be. Erase lightly so that if you change your mind, you’ll be able to recover your clues. Also, consider making a copy of your solution to reference., With each digit that you erase, work through the puzzle to make sure it can still be finished. Make sure that your player will still be able to use the clues available to fill in the blanks, and that there aren’t spaces with insufficient clues. If you find that it’s too difficult, replace the clues that you erased and try erasing others.

, Once you’ve finished erasing clues, give each empty square some extra attention with the eraser. If you don’t fully erase the missing squares, your player may be able to see which number was originally there. Then, use your marker to trace the numbers in the filled squares so that they don’t smudge.If you want to, copy your finished puzzle onto a new grid so there's no chance of a player seeing your original answers.

, Make some copies of your finished puzzle at home or in a copy shop. Next, share it with your friends and family members. Get some feedback about the difficulty of your puzzle, then practice making a few more.

List them on eBay or another reputable selling site.",How to Sell Your Pokémon Cards1," The most accurate sellers will learn about the sets their cards belong in, so the buyer knows exactly which ones they're buying.


A set is identified by a small symbol that is either in the bottom right-hand corner of the Pokémon illustration (old sets), or on the bottom right-hand corner of the whole card (new sets).
To learn which symbols stand for which sets, look up the Pokémon on eBay and match the illustrations with ones you see—the set should be listed.;
, Use the numbers at the bottom right-hand corner of the card (all sets).


There should be two numbers: one for the number of the actual card, a slash (/) and then one for the number of cards in the entire set (i.e. a Charizard with 5/102 is number 5 out of 102 cards).
There are a few exceptions to these: Base set cards, which were one of the first three sets released in America, do not have a symbol on the card. They are the only ones like this; and Promos, which only have one number denoting what number the card is (Ivy Pikachu, for example, is number 1 out of the first released series of Black Star Promos).

, This will protect them from UV light.


After you've put them in sleeves, it's a good idea to put them either in ""top loaders"" (hard plastic cases to prevent bending) or in 9-pocket card sleeves that are held in binders.you can also use Ultra Pro deck Protector Sleeves which come in red, blue, green, etc. And both are fairly Cheap. Use plastic Binders and page Sleeves for easy storage.
All of these things can be purchased at a Walmart store or a card collecting store, and the best brands to get are Ultra-Pro or Dragon Shield.

, You'll notice that some cards have stars in the bottom right-hand corners, some have diamonds, and some have circles.


Once your cards are organized by number, you'll see the stars first, the diamonds next, and the circles last. Then you see the trainers, and the cycle repeats, and if there are any Secret Rares, there will be a Pokémon at the end of your set with stars. If not, that's fine too. Stars mean a Pokémon is Rare, diamonds mean it is Uncommon, and circles mean Common. Rare cards sell, of course, for much more than the others.
Note: If your cards are Japanese, and the star/diamond/circle symbol is white instead of black, it denotes an ultra rare card. Also, with Japanese cards, if the symbol is that of three stars, it is an ultra rare premium card—the hardest cards to find!

, Card prices fluctuate all the time, and to save you money buying a guide that may not be accurate, just go on Ebay and look up completed listings of the card(s) you want to sell!


Most of the time cards sell for more than they are listed as they're worth in magazines, though some times they sell for less. The only way to tell is to see what's going on with the actual buyers.

, This is how you will draw people into buying them. Be sure to list what set it belongs to, the number (i.e. ""This card is from Dragon Frontiers and is x/104""), it's rarity (Rare, uncommon, common, secret rare, etc.), and condition (Mint, Near-Mint, Fair, Played with, Poor, etc).


Describe them down to every detail so the buyer knows for sure what they're getting! Of course, make sure to tell them if the card has any bends or scratches—it'll hurt the value if it does, but it's better for the price to go down a few pennies than you to get bad feedback and lose buyers.

, Most only take a very small amount for profit, so it's very cheap to use them! If you'd rather sell them in real life, then you can do that also!

Sit in a circle.,
Deal each player seven cards without looking at them.,
Stack the leftover cards in the center.",How to Deal Cards for Uno2," The game will proceed clockwise (or counterclockwise, if you prefer) around the circle from the person who is going first. It does not matter whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise as long as you all agree on the direction.

, Pass out the cards one at a time. Whoever drew the highest card is the first dealer. If you are going clockwise, start by giving the card at the top of the deck to the person to your left. Continue around the circle in this manner until each person has one face-down card. Then, keep dealing around the circle in the same pattern until everyone has the right amount of cards.


Deal the cards face-down so that each player knows which cards he or she has. If you accidentally reveal a card, slide it back into the dealing pile at random.
If you are the dealer, you still get cards! Don't leave yourself out.
Again: you don't have to deal exactly seven cards to each person as long as everyone has the same amount of cards. Some people play a variation in which the dealer can arbitrarily choose how many—or how few—cards to deal at the beginning of each round.

, Once you deal, you should have an extra stack of cards left. Place these cards face-down in the middle of the floor or table where you're playing. Everyone in the game should be able to easily reach this stack.


Designate a space next to these cards for the Discard pile. This is where you'll put the cards that get knocked out of play."
"
Let everyone look through their cards.,
Place one card face-up on the table.,
Play UNO.",How to Deal Cards for Uno3," Each player now has a ""hand"" of (probably) seven cards. Give the players a few moments to arrange their cards in an effective way. This is when most experienced players begin to make connections between their cards and plan out the beginnings of their strategy.

, Once everyone has the right amount of cards, the dealer picks up the card at the top of the deck places it face-up in the Discard pile. Then, the dealer picks the next card and lays it on the table for everyone to see. This is the starting card. If it is a power-up card (e.g. Draw Two, Draw For, Wild), deal another card on top of it.

, Start from the card that is face-up in the center of the table. The player who is going first puts down a card that of the same number or color from his or her own 7-card hand. Then the person on the left (clockwise) or right (counterclockwise) does the same. The game continues in that direction. The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards – the last person holding cards ""loses"".

Heal your affected Pokémon.",How to Play With Pokémon Cards," Your deck should have more than 25 cards and it should be shuffled well. One-fourth to one-third of the cards in your deck should be energy cards.;
, Take 7 cards from the top of the deck and put them aside, face down.

, These are your prize cards.

, Typically these should be on your right side, opposite to the prize cards. Your Discard Pile will be next to the deck.

, Look for a basic Pokémon in your hand of 7 cards. If there aren't any, shuffle your hand into your deck and draw another 7 cards. Each time you do this, your opponent can draw an extra card.

, If you have at least one basic Pokémon in your hand, put the one you want to use for attack first face down onto the playing area a few inches in front of you. If you have more basic Pokémon cards in your hand, you can put them face down beneath your active Pokémon as your bench. You may have no more than 5 Pokémon on your bench at one time.

, Place these cards in a pile on the side face-down, without looking at them. Each time you knock one of your opponent's Pokémon out, take a prize card. When you run out of prize cards, you win. Fewer prize cards can be used for a faster game.

, Flip a coin to see who starts. The first player cannot attack.

, When you are ready to begin, make sure your active and benched Pokémon cards are all turned face up. The rest of your hand, prizes, and the rest of your deck should all be face down. You can look at your hand, but not your deck or prize cards.

, You win if you take all your prize cards, if your opponent has to draw but can't because they've run out of cards in their deck, or if you knock out all Pokémon on your opponent's field.

,, If you have a basic Pokémon in your hand, you can place that Pokémon in your bench. This can be done as many times as you want. There can be up to five Pokémon on your bench.

, You can attach one Energy card per turn by placing it underneath one of your Pokémon, below all pre-evolved forms.

, These cards are self-explanatory and let you do lots of helpful things. Different types of Item cards are Trainers, Supporters, Tools, and Stadiums. You can activate any number of Trainer cards during your turn, but only one Supporter. After they are used, they go to the discard pile. A Pokémon Tool can be attached to one of your Pokémon that doesn't already have a tool attached to it. They stay there with the Pokémon until the Pokémon gets knocked out, at which point they both get discarded. When you play a stadium, it is placed horizontally between both player's fields. It is discarded when a new stadium comes into play. There are also special energy cards used to provide energy and do something else special that is said on the card.

, If you have evolution cards for a Pokémon that is active or on your bench, you can evolve the Pokémon by placing that card on top of it. A Basic evolves into a Stage 1, and a Stage 1 into a Stage 2. You can't evolve a Pokémon on the first turn it is played, either by benching them or evolving them, unless using an effect. You also can't evolve Pokémon on your first turn.

, Some Pokémon have abilities which can be used for special effects.These are listed on their cards.

, To retreat a Pokémon is to switch it out for another Pokémon on your bench. Usually, you will have to pay a retreat cost by discarding energy attached to that Pokémon. The retreat cost will be listed on the bottom of the card. You can only retreat once per turn.

, The last thing you can do in your turn is to attack your opponent's active Pokémon using yours. After you attack, your turn ends. You cannot attack on your first turn if you go first. This action is expanded upon in the following section.

, You have to have the right amount and type of Energy needed for the attack cost (listed on the card to the left of the attack name) attached to that Pokémon in order to attack.


Some attacks require colorless energy. There are indicated by white stars, and can be any type of energy. Other attacks will require specific energy types.

, Most cards have a Weakness to a particular type. It will receive additional damage if your Pokémon is of the type it has weakness to.

, It will receive less damage if your Pokémon is of the type it has resistance to.

, The damage an attack inflicts will be to the right of the attack name. This damage is placed on the defending Pokémon. In game, damage will be referred to as damage counters, with each one representing 10 damage. You can keep track of these damage counters by using official counters, any sort of small flat objects, or with dice.

, Pokémon with 0 HP are knocked out. Place them in their owner's discard pile, along with any Energies or items that may be attached, and any or all evolutions. Then, you can take a Prize card.

, These include Burned, Poisoned, Asleep, Confused, and Paralyzed. Poisoned, Burned, Asleep, and Paralyzed have effects that occur in-between turns, in that order.

, Put a Poison marker on the Pokémon that is poisoned. It takes 1 damage counter between each turn.

, Place a Burned marker on the Pokémon if it is Burned. Flip a coin in-between turns. If heads, the Pokémon takes no burn damage. If tails, put 2 damage counters on the Burned Pokémon.

, If a Pokémon is Asleep, its card is turned counterclockwise. Flip a coin in-between turns; if heads, the Pokémon wakes up. If tails, stays asleep. Asleep Pokémon cannot retreat or attack.

, Paralyzed Pokémon are turned clockwise, and can't retreat or attack. Paralysis is cured between turns if the Pokémon was Paralyzed since the beginning of your last turn.

, The card of a Confused Pokémon is turned upside down. Flip a coin before you attack with a Confused Pokémon; if tails, put three damage counters on that Pokémon and the attack does nothing. If heads, your Pokémon attacks successfully.


If the attack involves a coin flip, flip for the Confusion first.

, The easiest way to heal an affected Pokémon is by returning it to the bench. It cannot be retreated if it is asleep or paralyzed, but can still be switched by using effects. You can also use trainer cards that heal status conditions. If a Pokémon would be affected by multiple conditions that rotate the card, only the most recent one applies.

, If you’re going for realism, search for an animated image with the same characteristics as real Pokemon, like sharp edges and bold colors. If you want a funny card or something unique, you can use a photo of yourself or scary animal. Once you’ve chosen your image, upload it onto the site.


Choose an image that goes with the type of Pokémon that you’re creating. For example, you might choose a water or fire type, in which case you should make sure the image you choose fits the type. So if you have a photo of a animal shooting water from its mouth, don`t choose fire type.

, The evolution stage is similar to giving your Pokemon’s age. If it's basic then it’s a kid, if it’s stage 1 then it’s a teen, and if it’s stage 2 then it is a adult.

, If choosing a name is difficult, think about what your Pokémon represents. Is it funny? Is it powerful? Is it scary? You can name it after its move like “Firebreather” or “Lightning Strike”, Each Pokémon has a set of special characteristics and a card maker site will prompt you with what to fill out. This is what makes up your Pokémon and should be fun. Think about the type moves and and weaknesses your card should have. Put in its attacks, fill out the author statement, and the weaknesses of the Pokemon., It’s important to come up with a name that represents your Pokémon well. Use the official Pokémon font that can be found using a quick online search., The stronger your Pokémon is, the higher the HP level. You can also be hit more often with a high HP number.How much health your Pokémon will have depends on its type. For example, water types tend to have high health. Additionally, Stage 1 or Stage 2 evolutions will have more health than previous evolutions.

, Below the Pokemon’s image, add 2 or 3 types of attacks. When attacking your opponent, you need to develop a strategy so choose your moves wisely.As with health, the damage your attacks do is based on the Pokémon's type and evolutionary stage. Different types also have different effects (ie. electric types often have coin flips in their attacks, and fire types commonly make you detach energy to attack).
For example, when attacking, you could say, ""Quick Attack, hit!"" If your opponent does not say dodge before you say hit, than your opponent loses however many damage counters the move has.
Sometimes, if a Pokémon is very weak to a type of pokemon, you can retreat. Other times, when your opponent is very weak to a certain type of pokemon, and the move has a boost in attack.
Keep in mind that you can also use potions, trainer cards and supporter cards together with your moves. Those cards count as one turn.

, Directly to the right, create how many damage counters the attack move has. Whenever attacking, make sure to check for special conditions. Next to the attacks will be the damage it produces and under will also be either the status it changes to (ex.sleep poison stunned), or instructions to flip a coin to do more damage, depending on heads or tails. On the left side will be the attacks attribute.Attack attributes often put the defending Pokémon to sleep or continue to deal damage.
Before starting a battle, always make sure to check weakness and resistance.

, The Pokedex number is the order assigned by the International Pokédex. It gives a brief history and characteristics of your Pokemon

, For example, mushroom pokemon, tiny mouse pokemon, or destruction Pokémon are all valid types. Also, include the height and weight below the image to help distinguish your type., When trading and selling cards, you can find out if it is rare, when you look at the bottom right corner. There will be either a circle meaning not rare, a rhombus meaning uncommon, a star meaning rare, and a shining star meaning very rare.

, You will find two numbers that indicate how rare a card is. The higher the number the better. If you find a card that looks something like this, (109\108) that means that you have a rare card.

, Pokémon cards will list something about the pokemon. For example, ""Because it is very proud, it hates accepting food from people. Its thick fur guards it from stuns. The illustrator weakness resistance and retreat cost should also located at the bottom of your card.

, Some cards are rare Holofoil or collectable cards, and usually have a shiny texture. So if you decide to mimic this feature, use glossy material. There are several different types of cards. There are full Art Cards, Holofoils, Reverse Holos, and Old School cards.


Old School cards are older cards. They often have different art styles, or red HP. If you are not sure, check the bottom of the card for the date. You cannot buy these cards in stores.

, Pokemon cards are 2 separate cards glued together, a front and a back. Remove them, and keep the back for later.

, Upload the file to an image editor, preferably one that can support layers, such as Paintshop pro, GIMP 2 or Photoshop.

, There are many image creating software that allow you to both create and edit. Some must be purchased, like Photoshop, and some are free, like GIMP.


There are also websites that specifically cater to creating Pokemon imagery. If you use a website, simply follow the directions given.

, Search keywords like “Pokemon Card Resources” or simply use a real card as your template. Recreate the Pokémon card template using the tools of the image software.


Recreate the border, edit your Pokémon picture, write text for HP, moveset, and any other things that are necessary to get an authentic look.

, When creating your text it is important to choose the right fonts as they appear on official cards. Search for Pokémon fonts online but keep in mind that some sites may require you to purchase their fonts., Choose a file name that’s easy to remember and file type. Go to the top menu and click 'export' to export the card to a pdf and save it as a JPEG or PNG.

, Open the PDF file with a Word Processor (ex. Microsoft Word) and resize it to match that of an authentic card (6.3 in width and 8.8 cm in height). Once you've resized it, remember the pixels of the card that you printed, so you can make a back.

, Make sure to use high quality color ink for best results. You should also consider the cardboard you are going to use. White cardstock works well.


Keep in mind the texture of the card.

, Be careful not to create jagged or slanted edges. Use the back of the card that you saved to ensure that the size matches up. Glue it to the back of an existing card for rigidity. Apply a transparent tape on the cards to give it a glossy feel


Glue it on with a strong glue such as rubber cement.
Use the back of an existing card that you preferably do not care for such as a weak double.

Exchange the Pokémon card(s) for money.",How to Tell if a Pokémon Card Is Rare and How to Sell It," There are many different types of cards in the Pokémon trading card game. These are sold in sets contained in plastic packaging, boxes, promotional packs, tins, and more. Each collection contains a different percentage chance of having a rare card, so knowing how you bought your cards can help locate rare ones.


In many cases, more expensive collections of cards, like boxes and tins, have a higher chance of having rare cards. You may want to start looking for rare cards in your boxed or tinned sets.;
, Cards that are marked in the bottom right corner with a circle (common) or diamond (uncommon) won't likely be worth much. Most of these cards can be safely set off to the side, but over time, even common cards can become rare.


When dealing with common cards that are also old, set these aside with other potentially rare cards, as their rarity and value may have increased.
You might consider giving old Pokémon cards that aren't worth much as presents to friends or relatives.

, Cards with a star (rare), holofoil picture, a star followed by a letter or symbol (which frequently indicates ultra rare, like ☆H), and secret cards have a better chance of being more valuable.


Secret cards are not officially listed as part of the collection. You can find the collection number as a fraction in the bottom right corner of the card. When the number before the slash is larger than the one following it, you have a secret card.
Among rare cards, there are sometimes even rarer cards. For example, nearly all holofoil cards are rare, but there's an even rarer variety, the holofoil rare, which is indicated by a star in the lower right corner of the card.
Some cards contain small printing errors that make the card especially rare. These are often worth huge sums of money. If you notice an error in your card, it might mean you have one that's particularly valuable., Promotional cards are given away as part of a special event or are included as a bonus in some packs. These were originally marked with a black star and the words ""PROMO."" There are also promo cards that have a gold foil star.Older cards will have a promotional symbol beneath the set symbol, which you can find under the right corner of the Pokémon picture. Newer card promo symbols are in the bottom right corner of the card.
Some promo cards are given out at events, included with magazine subscriptions, or sent with similar merchandise, like the Pokémon video games.
Promo cards can range greatly in value. Some are very common, while others are incredibly rare., Generally, first edition cards are rarer and worth more money, so these should be given priority when selling. You'll only find first edition cards among older ones made by Wizards of the Coast. Pokémon International does not currently print first edition cards.


You can find the symbol indicating the edition of your cards below the lower left corner of the Pokémon picture. The symbol will look like a number enclosed in a black circle with the word ""Edition"" above in small letters., In almost all cases, Pokémon cards will belong to a corresponding set. These sets are usually released four times a year, with each card in a set bearing the same symbol in either the bottom right corner of the card or below the bottom right corner of the Pokémon picture. Complete sets can sell for a lot of money, but older sets might be rare enough to split and sell a card at a time.


Some Generation I sets include: Jungle, Fossil, and Team Rocket.
Some Generation II sets include: Neo Genesis, Neo Discover, and Legendary Collection.
Some Generation III sets include: EX Ruby & Sapphire, EX Dragon, EX FireRed & LeafGreen, and EX Unseen Forces.
Some Generation IV sets include: Diamond & Pearl, Majestic Dawn, Legends Awakens, Supreme Victors, Unleashed, and Undaunted.
Some Generation V sets include: Black & White, Noble Victories, Plasma Blast, and Dragon Vault.
Some Generation VI sets include: XY, Flashfire, Primal Clash, Ancient Origins, BREAKthrough, BREAKpoint, and Fates Collide., There are many different ways you might want to organize your Pokemon cards. It might seem tedious, but gathering similar cards together will help you keep track of them better. You might choose to:


Divide you cards according to rarity. This way, all the rare cards you discovered in your deck are grouped together and ready to be sold.
Collect cards in sets. Since sets often sell for more, this might be a good tactic if you have many full sets of cards.
It also might help you to make a list of the rare cards you have. Cards are small and can be lost easily. Having a record can help you recognize when something is missing or misplaced., This is often the best indication of rarity. However, if you have many cards, it might not be worth your time to research every single card you have. You might want to limit your research to rare or old cards, as these stand a better chance of being valuable. To research the value of your cards, you can:


Look up the same card on online sellers or auctions, like Amazon or eBay. The average selling price of your card should help you figure out its base worth.
There are also Pokémon card game sites dedicated to tracking the sales of the cards. One favorite site among collectors is Pokémon Prices, which is updated hourly.Check collector catalogs. You should be able to find these online, but you might also be able to find them in your public library. These usually indicate the rarity of the card and its approximate value.

, Originally, Pokémon cards were produced and sold by the company Wizards of the Coast. Now, cards are made and sold by Pokémon International. If you notice differences between old and new cards, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a fake. These cards may only be produced by different companies.


By knowing the two producers of Pokémon cards, you could save yourself from accidentally throwing away a salable card.

, Cards that are in new condition or original packaging are almost always worth more money than cards with bends, tears, creases, or other disfiguring marks. Mint condition cards will have sharp, crisp edges, little wear along the edges, and its original gloss. Many card collectors categorize cards as:GEM-MT, which stands for ""Gem Mint."" These cards have no staining, blemishes, little to no printing imperfections, sharp corners, and a smooth surface gloss.
MINT, which should have very little or no damage. These cards differ from gem mint cards in that they frequently have only one minor flaw.
NM-MT means near mint to mint, and indicates a very high quality card. At a glance, these might seem perfect, but upon close inspection have one or more slight flaws.
EX, also known as ""Excellent"" cards, will have more obvious damage. There may be rounding at the corners, light scratches, and very light creases.
VG stands for ""Very Good."" These cards may have visible damage, but so long as the damage does not detract from the card's overall appearance, it's considered a VG card.
GOOD cards should still be pleasing to the eye, but will be marred by obvious damage, like rounded corners, staining, scratches, and loss of surface gloss., It might take a while before you're able to sell your card. In the meantime, damage to it can decrease its worth. You may want to use a plastic sleeve or card protector to prevent your rare cards from losing value.Card protectors or sleeves are a must when selling your cards in person. When selling a card face to face, the buyer will likely want to inspect the card before purchasing. A protector or sleeve will prevent accidental damage.
In most cases, a card protector 2.5 by 3.5 in. (64 by 89 mm) will fit your Pokémon cards. Some ""jumbo"" size promotional cards may require larger card protectors.

, If you're too young to sell the cards online, you may find some willing buyers among your friends or fellow Pokémon card game players. You never know when the friend of a friend might be looking for the card you are trying to sell.


Many libraries, hobby shops, and schools hold weekly or monthly tabletop gaming events. This might be the perfect place for you to find someone interested in buying your rare cards., Hobby shops are more than just a place for you to buy games, more Pokémon cards, and play the Pokémon card game with your friends. At most shops, you can also sell your unwanted rare cards to the shop owner.


Common cards will be less desirable and sell for less, so it's not likely that a shop owner will want to buy anything less than a rare card.
Your local hobby shop might have an announcement board on which you can advertise the card you're trying to sell. If your hobby shop has one of these, ask if you can advertise on it.
Be careful when selling your cards at a hobby shop. They'll want to make the biggest profit off their purchase, so they'll try to buy your cards for as little as possible. It may help to prepare yourself to haggle over the sale of the card., Even at smaller, local Pokémon card game meet ups, like those held at hobby shops, you might stumble upon someone interested in buying your card. Larger events, like regional and national tournaments, will have even more Pokémon fans who might be interested.


You can find a complete listing of official Pokémon card game events on the trading card homepage. In the upper right corner, you should find the ""Attend Events"" tab, which will provide you with a list of events.Many Pokémon fans can also be found at comic, video game, and cosplay conventions. If an official Pokémon event is impossible to attend, an unofficial, similar convention could be a good place to sell.

, This is one of the easiest and most visible ways of putting your card up for sale. The more people who see your card, the more likely someone who wants it will see it. However, many online sellers require you to be 18 years of age before you are allowed to use the service.


If you're too young to put your cards up for sale online on your own, you can ask for help from a parent or guardian.
Common online sellers include eBay, Amazon, and several Pokémon oriented sites, like Professor-oak and the Pokémon Card Market., This will depend on your personal situation. If you have a complete set, you may find that you can make the most money by selling it all together. However, in other cases, it may be easiest and/or more profitable to sell your cards one at a time.


You could also group together related rare cards and sell them as a bundle. For example, if you have several rare psychic Pokemon, you might sell these together.
If you have a large amount of common cards, you may still be able to sell these and make back some cash. You might try assembling common cards into ""beginner decks"" to sell.

, This will be the acceptable range for which you're willing to sell the card. Choosing a price range is very useful when selling, as many buyers will want to haggle the price down. Knowing the bottom range you're willing to sell at will help prevent you from being talked into selling too low.


For example, a Lugia EX card can sell for around $26. You might decide that your acceptable selling range for this card is between $23 - $27.
A selling range can also help if your card isn't selling. In this case, you might take your card off the market, then put it on the market with a price lower in your selling range.
Try to keep your selling range to yourself. If buyers find out your lower limit, they may hard ball you for the lowest possible price, even if they're willing to pay your asking price., This will be a specific number in your selling range. In nearly all situations, you'll start negotiating the sale of your card with a specific asking price. This number may increase or decrease during negotiation, but it should never drop below the lower limit of your selling range.


If you find that your cards aren't selling, you may have a selling range that's too high for the current market. To improve your chances at a sale, you may want to adjust your range.
The market for cards can change drastically in a very short time. If cards aren't selling, or if you only get low offers, you might only have to wait until the market picks back up., The fashion you do this will be influence by the place you've chosen to sell your cards. If you're selling cards in person at events, card protectors will keep your cards safe while traveling and handling. Online sales, in most cases, will need a picture to be included when the card is put up for sale.


If you're posting an advertisement at your local hobby shop, you can write your own short description of the card, its price, and your contact information. Print this with a picture of the card and post it.
If you don't have a camera to take a picture of your card, you could use your cell phone camera, instead.

, You should never give or send the cards you are selling to someone else without receiving payment first. Once the payment has been exchanged, you should give or send your card to the buyer to complete the sale. Now you can use the money for whatever you desire.

Organize by deck boxes.,
Use a binder.There are many card collecting games similar to the Pokémon TCG (trading card game).,
File cards away into a card catalog.,
Separate cards into storage boxes.",How to Organize Pokémon Cards1," This system works well if you are still building your collection and most of your cards are collected into decks. Simply place your cards into an empty deck box and place the box somewhere convenient, like on a shelf or in your closet.


Since you've likely started to change your decks to be stronger when playing, you may want to name or label your decks so you know exactly what each box contains. For example, you might put a piece of tape on a box and write on the tape, ""Psychic Pokémon Deck."";
, These have frequently made use of binders, and this method of organization might be right for you. This format will allow a clear view of your cards and easy access. It will also protect your cards from damage, like bending and mold.


These trading card binders are often filled with plastic inserts which have pockets for your cards. You can buy inserts like this from your local board game/hobby store.
You might also make use of tabs to help you easily navigate your binder. Binder tabs can be bought at most office supply stores.
You can make your own simple tab by fastening a piece of tape to the front and back of your plastic insert, allowing some extra tap to stick out from your binder. Then write the heading on your tab, for example, you might write, ""Type: Grass.""

, This method is best for serious collectors who have thousands of cards to keep track of.A card catalog is usually a large, wooden piece of furniture filled with narrow drawers into which you can put cards.You can find card catalogs at flea markets, garage sales, eBay, CraigsList, and antique stores, though antique catalogs may be expensive.


If you purchase your card catalog secondhand, you should inspect it carefully. Many of these are old, and you might have to spend some time or money restoring it to hold your cards safely and securely.

, You can buy narrow box-sleeves that are designed to hold your cards at your local game/hobby store, office supply store, or online. There are also larger boxes intended specifically for storing trading cards that you could easily use for your Pokémon cards.After you organize your cards you can store your collection in these boxes, you can label each box according to your system of organization. For example, you might label one box, ""Fighting Type,"" and another ""High HP Pokémon.""

Spread out all your Pokémon cards on the floor or a table.,
Sort them all into piles by their type.,
Take a binder (2 1/2 or 3 inch.),Use a 3 hole hole puncher and make holes in 9 pieces of plain white paper.,Write the names of every single type of Pokémon (grass, water, lightning, colourless, metal, darkness, psychic, fire, fairy, dragon, and fighting) on a separate piece of paper for each.,
Put all the cards in the cards slot sheets.,
Use the papers and place them in between all of the types depending where the types are in your binder.",How to Sort Your Pokémon Cards," Make sure you can see all of them.
, For example, put all your grass Pokémon in a pile., and put card slot sheets in it. You should start by putting at least 100 card slot sheets in.,,, Make sure you have all the types sorted in the card slots next to each other., That way you can flip to the type of Pokémon you are looking for."
"
Locate the symbol.,
Separate your cards by set symbol and number.,
Look for ""secret rare"" cards.,
Collect promotional cards together.,
Place cards in your storage container.",How to Organize Pokémon Cards2," Most Pokémon cards have a symbol below the bottom right corner of the Pokémon's image.This symbol identifies the set. Some examples of set symbols include a flower (Jungle set, #2), a hollow star (Neo Genesis set, #8), and the letter 'R' (Team Rocket set, #5).Sets are usually released four times a year.


If you have purchased cards from Pokémon International, or possess cards from this series, the set information will be located in lower right hand corner at the bottom of your card. These symbols can be small and easy to miss; look carefully!, It'll be easy for you to group all like symbol cards together, but for further organization you'll need to arrange by set number. Each set has a designated number of cards, and each card is numbered within its set. This will help you organize your cards with even greater precision.


You may need to use an online card directory to determine each cards position in a set. Many online set directories will first require you to choose the set category (like Base, Aquapolis, and Jungle) before linking you to the card number directory.
The base set of the first cards released in English do not have a symbol. You may want to gather these cards together and arrange them according to HP (hit points) or alphabetic order., Within sets, there are sometimes special cards that have a number higher than the set directory lists. These are ""secret rare"" cards. For example, you may see a card that is 63/62. This is not an error; this means that you have a special card., You'll find that some of your cards only have a card number and no set number. This indicates that the card is a promotional card, also referred to as a ""promo."" These are frequently given as a bonus to players when they purchase a deck.


Although promotional cards have no set number, you can still organize these according to card number or release date. You'll have to look up this information online, as there are many promo cards, each with a different number and release date.You should also keep an eye out for ""black star promos."" These are extra special cards that are produced specifically for promotional events., Depending on which method of storage you have chosen, this may be a binder, a box-sleeve, or even a card catalog. Now that your cards are organized by set, you can insert these into your storage container to complete your organization.


If you are using a binder, make sure the card slots are big enough for your Pokémon cards. Some card binders are intended for smaller cards, and trying to fit your Pokémon cards in these might cause your cards to bend or otherwise deform.
When organizing your cards by set, trust the set symbols and number, even if the Pokémon on the card appears to be the same. Charizard from the Dragon Frontiers set and Charizard from the Power Keepers set have different numbers, pictures, and abilities."
"
Gather each evolution in a separate stack.,
Organize your evolutionary groups.,
Insert your cards into your binder, box, or catalog.",How to Organize Pokémon Cards3," Most Pokémon evolve into a stronger form when a certain level is attained or a special item is used.Go through your Pokémon cards and pick out all Pokémon that are in the same evolutionary series. Start with the lowest evolution Pokémon and put all higher evolutions together with it. This will likely create many stacks, depending on the volume of your collection.


While many Pokémon evolve, some do not. All single evolution Pokémon can be grouped together., Now that your cards are separated by evolution, you should think about how you want to organize these groups. You might want to alphabetize your evolutions, or you could group these according to type, keeping all like-type evolutions together.


Even if you divide your evolutions into like-type categories, it can still be difficult to easily find evolutions within the type grouping. To further organize your like-type sets, you might want to alphabetize all evolutions within like-type sets., Place your cards into your binder, box-sleeve, or catalog according to your evolutionary organization. To make sure your cards are easily accessible, you may want to create sections in your binder, use separate boxes, or use different drawers for each category you have organized your evolutions into.


For example, if you are using box-sleeves, you might keep all your fire evolutions together and label the box ""Fire Types."" If you've chosen to use a binder, you can create section dividers to keep types separate with tabs."
"
Find the national Pokédex number.,
Search online for the national number, if necessary.,
Separate cards by national number.,
Store your cards by national number.",How to Organize Pokémon Cards4," Even if you aren't a fan of the animated series or the Pokémon video games, you probably know that in the Pokémon universe trainers have a special device called a Pokédex. The Pokédex is a kind of Pokémon dictionary, and it lists a number for each Pokémon.You can use this number to organize your Pokémon.


In the Pokémon TCG, you can sometimes find the national number in the information below the picture of the Pokémon card or in the bottom left hand corner of the card. Some cards will not have the national Pokédex number written., An online Pokédex exists, as well computer and mobile device apps, and you can use any of these to search for national numbers of the Pokémon you are trying to organize.You might be able to speed the sorting process by writing down each Pokémon card you own, looking up the number, and writing the number next to the name.

, Organizing your cards by Pokedex number is especially useful if you are a card collector. The numbers make referencing your collection simple and straightforward. However, for active Pokémon TCG players, this may not be the best option for deck-building and playing.

, Now that your cards are organized by Pokédex number, all you need to do is put your cards in your container/binder in order. You can group cards you have multiple copies of together, or if using a binder, you may be able to put duplicates into the same card pocket of your plastic insert.


You should be aware that putting several cards in the same plastic pocket in your binder could cause damage to the card. If the condition of the card is important to you, you should never have more than one card per plastic card pocket in your binder.
You may want to leave space in your container for cards that you know you are missing. This will make it easier to add any new cards that you get.

Identify cards by type.,
Arrange your cards within types.,
Archive your cards in a container.You'll have to decide the order you'll store your sorted Pokémon types.",How to Organize Pokémon Cards5," The basic Pokémon types are: bug, dark, dragon, electric, fairy, fighting, fire, flying, ghost, grass, ground, ice, poison, psychic, rock, steel, and water.However, there are also special types and hybrids, flying/ice to give one example. Collect all like-type Pokémon in one section apiece.Organizing by type is one of the more popular ways to organize cards for active players of the Pokémon TCG. This is because you can easily search your collection for useful type combinations.

, Even after separating your cards by type, if you have many cards it will be difficult to navigate your type groupings without a little more organization.You should create a sub-category within your type groups. You can do this by ordering the cards alphabetically or by national number, to name two options.

, You may want to do this alphabetically, with bug coming first, then dark, then dragon, and so on. If you are an active player, you may want to have your most used type first, followed by your second most used type, and so on.

"
"
Group your cards according to rarity.,
Arrange your rare card groupings.,
Pack away your cards.",How to Organize Pokémon Cards6," Organizing cards by rarity is another good method for collectors to use, as it organizes cards by relative financial value. This will make it easier for you to evaluate the worth of your card collection. Gather all cards of similar rarity into groups together.


Symbols in the bottom right corner of the card will indicate its rarity. A circle represents common cards, diamond uncommon, and star rare., You might use an alphabetic, national Pokédex number, or HP (hit point) system to further organize your rare card groups. If you are a player and collector, you may find that separating your rare card groupings into type, then arranging types by number or alphabetic order, works best., You'll probably want to separate binders, boxes, or drawers to keep different rarity groupings separate. An alternative to this would be to store your cards in your container and then use tabs to create sections for the different varieties of rare card.Even if you're using box-sleeves, you may want to keep your rare cards on hand so you can show these off to friends and other collectors. To keep your rare cards visible, you could put your rare cards in a binder that has plastic inserts with pockets for your cards.
To further protect rare cards, you might want to encase each in a special plastic card sleeve intended to keep rare cards pristine. These protectors will be 2.5 in. by 3.5 in. (64mm by 89mm) in size, and can be bought at your local hobby store.

"
Buy individual packs.,
Purchase promo tins.,
Purchase booster boxes.",How to Get Rare Pokémon Cards1," Individual packs of cards have a random assortment of card varieties, and typically include a few rare cards. Every booster pack is guaranteed 1 rare card, but may also include more. This includes particularly rare cards, such as holofoil, and “star” rare.


The rares you get from booster packs are completely random. You may have to open many, many booster packs to find the one particular rare you want.;
, Promo tins typically come with a few booster packs, as well as a selection of specific rare cards. This can be a great way of achieving a particular rare (along with a few random ones), assuming it’s a rare that you want.New Pokémon tins are regularly released as new sets of cards come out. Older tins are not always kept in stock however, so make sure you take advantage of tin releases.

, A booster box contains 36 booster packs, though it does not typically come with a specific rare, like the tins. Buying a box is the most efficient way of obtaining a large amount of cards, and many retailers will offer a small discount for purchasing a box.


Note that you will at least receive 36 rare cards by purchasing a box, and usually more than that. However, like buying individual packs, there is no guarantee of receiving a specific card that you desire.

Think of the kind of deck you want.,
Have a strategy in mind about how to win or get your opponent to lose.,
Remember to keep good balance as you choose.,
Think about the game as a three-role play.,
Balance your cards.,
Choose trainers that best support your Pokémon.,
Test your deck by drawing as if you were playing against an opponent.,
Include plenty of trainer and supporter cards.,
Don't stock too many evolutions.",How to Build a Pokémon Deck," Do you like to play Water and Fire Pokémon, or Psychic and Fighting? Most people only have two different types of Pokémon in their deck. Sometimes certain decks may effectively use more than two, and sometimes decks use only one.


Try to make your types complement each other if possible — for example, Water and Electricity are good companions, as are Fire and Grass.
Take into account the weaknesses of your types, too. If your Psychic-types have weakness to dark, play Fighting types (because most Dark Pokémon have Fighting weakness) to counter Dark-type Pokémon.
Remember that you can use colorless type Pokémon in any kind of deck to bulk it up and fill in gaps, and they often have many helpful effects. They often can use any kind of energy, too, so they can be used in any deck.;
, In the Pokémon TCG, you can win in one of three ways: Collect your opponent's six prize cards, make your opponent run out of Pokémon on the field, or make your opponent run out of cards to draw at the beginning of his/her turn. Ask yourself:

Which condition will your deck focus on to win the game? How will it best achieve that?
What are the ways that your opponent might counter your strategy? Which cards can you use to minimize your weaknesses and maximize your strengths?

, Many decks stick with roughly 20 Pokémon, 25 trainers, and around 15 energies for a good mix, although it often depends on the type of deck you're playing.


For example, a Blastoise/Keldeo-EX Deck from the 2012 City Championships sported 14 Pokémon, 32 trainers, and 14 energy.It all depends on what you're trying to do.

, First of all, you need to run multiple copies of your main attacker, and you'll need more of the Basic Pokémon than of the Stage 2, fully evolved ones, to be sure that you have an Active Pokémon and plenty for your bench.


Basic Pokémon can be knocked out quickly, so be sure you have some stage 1 or 2 cards up your sleeve. Evolve quickly to give your game some substance after the initial wave of weaker Pokémon.
Plan from start to finish. Most decks have a 'start' card like Cleffa or Pichu. cards like these can help you set-up. Have one or two really big 1-hit K.O.ers you can draw for late in play.

, It's good to use cards that help each other. It needs to be a good deck! Strategy is important!


Look for synergies in cards. For example, Hydreigon and Darkrai-EX are a great at moving around Pokémon and energies freely. Look for other great combination to use for your advantage.

, You will need about 5-8 trainers that help you draw cards; if you can't get the cards you need, you can't win.


Remember that you can put up to 4 of any given card in your deck. If your deck relies heavily on a card, you should boost your chances of drawing it by putting several copies of the card in your deck.
You should have around 5 or so cards to support and boost up your Pokémon. Any remaining space can be used to combat against frequently used cards or weaknesses, or to refresh your hand/bench.

, Remember, to begin play, you must draw at least one basic Pokémon, so be sure you have plenty of Basics to insure that you get a good opening draw.

, They can search your deck for any card you happen to need at the moment, Pokémon or energy. Include drawing cards to gain you advantage and replenish your hand. Also, use EXs, since they are vastly more powerful than most other basics, and get Pokémon with useful abilities.

, Nowadays, most decks use EXs for quick board presence and power. Some exceptions to this rule are useful evolutions like Pyroar or Eelektrik. The longer it takes to evolve your Pokémon, the more time your opponent has to attack and set up.

Make new evolved forms of your Pokemon.",How to Draw Your Own Pokémon Card," Before you get started with anything else, you should first figure out what kind of Pokémon you would like to make. Are you making a version of a pre-existing Pokemon? Your own version of Charizard, perhaps? Or maybe you'd prefer to strike out on your own and invent a new Pokémon altogether? Keeping things like this in mind are important before getting into any of the following steps.
, While you might try making a Pokémon card completely by hand, there are several template sites online that offer ample tool to make and print your customized Pokémon cards. In theory, you could use these template sites as a one-stop shop for your card making. However, it's recommended you use them simple as a basic template at first-- part of the enjoyment of making you r own cards is the creative expression involved in creating the artwork.

Pokemoncardmaker.org is arguably your best bet when it comes to online templates. It's by far the most customizable and compatible with all Pokémon trading card game systems. If you're looking for something more basic, Mypokecard.com will suit your purposes with a minimum of hassle.If you're not the DIY type, you can upload a .jpg or .png file to the site and use that has your card artwork.

, Once you have a basic template ready, you should print it out. If you're wanting to hold onto these cards for a while, your best bet i to invest in some high-quality printer paper. After all, you'll still be saving money in comparison to buying official cards from the store!, Once you have your card templates printed out, the next step is to get them glued to a thin cardboard backdrop. This will give them the characteristic sturdiness of real Pokémon cards. , Now that you've got our Pokémon cards glued onto a solid back support, it's time to cut them out. Your best bet is to use an exacto knife or some other variety of precision scalpel. That way, you'll be ensured the cleanest, smoothest cut between cards. Although it may feel boring to be so precise with this step, you'll ideally be spending far more time in the illustration phase, so it's well worth it to give your future work the canvas it deserves by taking as much time here as you need., Before you set a pen to any kind of paper, you should go into illustrating your creation with some kind of idea what you want it to look like. While creating a Pokémon from the ground up requires inspiration and a familiarity with the existing style of Pokemon, visualizing your illustration is important even if you're using a canon species. You'll only get a small rectangular frame to demonstrate the character and power of the Pokemon, so keeping dimensions (as much as style) is important to consider before you get to the applied planning stage.

As a starting exercise, you can try copying an official illustration of one of the Pokemon.
If you're inventing one of your own and are having a difficulty time inventing something you're satisfied with, look at other Pokémon for inspiration. Some of the most memorable-looking Pokémon are based on real-world animals. Look up some different kinds of animals, or go to the zoo. If the look of an animal appeals to you, base your Pokémon around it.

, With your templates now willing and able, it's time for the fun part-- that is, creating your Pokemon! In an ideal situation, you'll have spent roughly two thirds of the illustration stage in planning, leaving the final third to perfect it as best you can on the card itself. Take a few pieces of scrap paper to work with. You'll have more fun planning out your Pokémon if you have an idea what you want to do going into it.

If you're doing a version of an existing Pokemon, keep some examples of that Pokémon on hand to look at when you're in need of inspiration.

, In some cases, the illustration shows the Pokémon in action in a location; in others, it's a coloured background. Think of the backdrop you would like to showcase your Pokémon in. Is it a leaf-based Pokemon? If so, a natural setting like a forest is better suited than an arctic tundra or a sewer, for example.

If you're new to Pokémon card creation, working with a shaded background may be best, as it will help make the illustrating process significantly easier.

, Designing your Pokémon becomes progressively easier the more specific of an idea you have about where you want to go with it. It's recommended you draw two or three drafts of your Pokémon before bringing it to the final card. Each time through, you should experiment with new things and pinpoint the things you liked most about earlier drafts.If you're still having trouble grasping the specific art style of the Pokémon universe, try copying some official Pokémon illustrations first. This will acclimate your hand and eyes to the colourful aesthetic of the franchise., You shouldn't follow through with the final illustration until you have a solid idea of what the illustration's going to look like. Draw it a couple of times on draft paper, then attempt to replicate it on the card. take your time, starting with pencil, and finalizing with pen or ink. Be as slow and cautious as you can! Some errors may be able to be covered up, but you don't want to risk ruining your hard rock over a preventable slip-up.

Begin in pencil, then colour over. This will minimize the risk of mistakes, and lend you a last chance to rethink your design before you make the final cuts.
Although pencil crayons may be your go-to favourite, they usually lack the shiny boldness associated with Pokémon cards. Coloured marker pens may lend the best results.

, If you are designing a Pokémon of your own, you should have a reasonable idea what your Pokemon's role and type are, especially after having illustrated it. An electric-based Pokemon, for example, gravitates towards a much different set of moves than a leaf or psychic-based one. Depending on your experience with the Pokémon franchise, it is almost certainly helpful to look into the different types of Pokémon and the most common attacks for each. If you are making a version of an existing Pokemon, you won't have to worry about stats as much, as you'll already have the existing Pokemon's statistics to fall back on if you're not interested in meddling with them.

, Base stats are defined as the inherent average values for a given species of Pokemon. Using a given set of base stats is generally far more intuitive than striking out from scratch. From here, you can modify the stats to suit your ends. If you have an invented Pokemon, you can use a similar species' stats as your foundation and change them up as best suits you.Base stats include HP (Hit Points), Attack, Defence, Special Attack, Special Defence, and Speed.
For example, a Rattata has 30 base Hit Points and a 56 Attack rating. If you were making a Rattata Pokémon card, you could follow these stats exactly, or you could change them and add your own twist by modifying them slightly or significantly. , If you're intent on using this card in a game, you should include stats such as weakness, resistance and cost. These are generally contingent on the elemental type of Pokémon you are creating. Attacks, on the other hand, require some creativity, and can be a lot of fun to make in the process. Choose existing attacks from similarly powered Pokémon of a common elemental type, or design your own, with considerations given to balance, cost, strategy and power.Lists of all of the known Pokémon attacks may be found online. Take care to note the type (Fighting, Poison, Normal etc.) of attack as well as the power (damage) and power points (cost) of each attack. Use a few of these on your cards before you try making your own. For example, the well-known attack ""Blizzard"" is Ice-based, has a Power rating of 110, a power points cost of 5, and an accuracy of 70.
Of course, if you're using an existing Pokémon for your card creation, you can simply copy the attacks (and stats) from an existing version.

, It's arguably easier (not to mention tempting!) to make your Pokémon as powerful as possible, but that will rob the fun out of putting the card to use. Official Pokémon species are designed with consideration to the way they may be used strategically in-game.If you're just starting out, you may find it's easier to properly balance a common Pokémon as opposed to an uncommon or rare kind. Rarer breeds become more specialized in their abilities, and should only be designed when you have a firm grasp of the way the Pokémon game system functions.

Alternatively, you can make the card purely for its aesthetic value, in which case you can completely do without all notions of balance and restraint, should you wish to do so.

, At last, your card is done! You should make a point of showing it off to your friends. Post pictures of it online. Better still, submit it to an illustration contest. There are card design competitions you can apply to online. If for nothing else, you'll get your artwork showcased and seen by thousands! , If you designed a Pokémon of your own and are interested in designing more, you should try designing more advanced (or regressive) evolved forms of your Pokemon. The Pokémon levelling system is built largely around Pokémon evolving into improved forms. They may look different, but retain certain visible traits that denote a kinship between the forms. If you had fun making a Pokemon, you should visualize what your Pokémon could look like at the next stage and repeat the entire process all over again."

Buy from your local card shop.,
Buy from online retailers.,
Look for cards at yard sales.",How to Get Rare Pokémon Cards2," Independent game and card shops will buy and sell “used” Pokémon cards. This is the perfect way to peruse a library of cards and purchase just the individual cards that you want.Particularly rare cards will be quite expensive due to their high demand. Trade in a few cards that you don’t want to offset the high price.
Check back every week or so – players will always be trading in cards they no longer need.

, There are a variety of online shops that will sell individual cards – sometimes even fresh from the pack. If you don’t have a local shop and have the means to do so, find a reputable website and try building your collection.


Make sure you’re purchasing from a respectable company. If you are buying cards from an individual seller, such as through eBay, check their reviews and make sure you are purchasing exactly what you want.
Online card shops may charge a premium for certain cards, particularly if they open new packs to acquire them. Think of it as a convenience fee, as not everyone is necessarily willing to sell off cards they don’t want.

, Yard sales are a great place to find loads of cards. It's not uncommon for someone to get rid of their entire collection this way, whether it's someone who lost interest in the game, or a parent getting rid of a child’s old things.


Pawn shops are another great place to find a large number of cards. Some people sell their collection to a pawn shop just to get them out of the way. You can find some hidden gems this way, and usually for cheap!

Trade with other players.,
Put some cards on the line.,
Play in local tournaments.",How to Get Rare Pokémon Cards3," Not every player will want the same cards for their deck. Try finding someone who has a card you need (and they don’t want), and see if you can reach a trade agreement. It doesn't have to be card for card. Sometimes trading a few cards for a single rare card is worth the trade.


Game lobbies and shops are great places to meet other players, which can open up your trading opportunities.
Check online to see what rare cards are available, or for resources that can help you design a deck., Challenge your friends to a friendly game and wager one another’s cards! This adds an element of competition to card trading, and can be a good way of amassing additional cards that you can use for further trading.


Make sure you don’t mind parting with the cards you put on the line. You don’t want to wager cards that are important to any of your decks.
Keep things friendly! Such bets can get heated, even among friends, so make sure you are on good terms and agreeable with the person you are challenging.

, The prizes for winning local tournaments includes a large number of cards. This can range from the latest tin, to a box or two of the latest card set. If you’re a particularly good player, this can be a great way of getting the game to “pay for itself.”National tournaments tend to award actual money, rather than cards.
Take care when entering tournaments. The price of a winning deck can be quite steep, and the skill and dedication required are immense!

If you are certain it is a fake try making a small tear in it.,
A quick way to test if your Pokémon card is real or fake is to take a close look at the edge of it.",How to Know If Pokémon Cards Are Fake," Sometimes the pictures on fake cards show things that aren't even Pokémon, like Digimon (or similar imitators) or animals. Be suspicious if what a card displays looks questionable, or if there appears to be a sticker on top of the card.;
, If the HP is anywhere over 250, or the attacks don't exist, then it's a fake for sure. Also, if it says HP 80 instead of 80 HP, it is definitely a fake card because real cards say 80 HP, not HP 80. That's only with old cards; new cards have HP 80 instead of 80HP.


However, a few genuine cards have the variable and the attribute name inverted as a result of a printing mistake. Do not discard the card as fake without making further checks, as if the card is a genuine with a mistake, it may be valuable.

,, Many fakes have energy symbols that are slightly larger, distorted, or offset from each other.

, On fake cards, the text is usually slightly smaller than on real cards and is usually in a different font.

, The weakness/resistance's maximum damage addition/subtraction is +/-40, unless the weakness is x2. The retreat cost is no more than 4.

, With fake cards, the box won't have trademarks and will say something like ""pre-release trading cards"". It will be made from cheap cardboard, without the standard bag.

, Fake cards often have wrong spellings. Common mistakes among them including spelling the Pokémon names incorrectly, having no accent i.e. "" ` "" sign on the 'e' of 'Pokémon' , etc. You may also see the cards spelling the attacks inaccurately, and not having any energy signs under the attack for the attack description.

, Sometimes (particularly for base set cards), people will stamp a card with their own 1st edition stamp. How can you tell the difference? First, a fake stamp is usually more imperfect and there are a few blotches on the stamp. Second, fake stamps come right off if you try to rub/scratch them off, very easily.

, Those rare Pokémon are purposely the wrong color). The chances that it's a factory mistake are very slim; it's much more likely to be fake.

, On fake cards, the blue swirling design often looks purplish. Also, sometimes the Poké Ball is upside down (on a real card, the red half is on the top).

, A fake card usually feels thin and flimsy and you may be able to see through it if you hold it up to the light. Some fake cards, on the other hand, are too hard and look shiny. If it's the wrong size, that's also a telltale sign. Different materials will also wear differently, so on more ""used"" cards look for more damage to corners and unusual wear patterns. Also, fake cards often have no copyright date or the illustrator at the bottom of the card.

, Is the card in question the same size? Is it too pointy? Is it centered right? Is there more yellow on one side of the card than the other?

, If it bends with great ease, it's a fake. The real cards are not flimsy.

, Then take an old Pokémon card you don't use anymore, and make a small rip in that. Then compare the rate at which both ripped. If the fake one ripped faster, then it's without a doubt a fake.

, Real Pokémon cards have a very thin sheet of black between the cardboard. It's very thin, but up close it is easy to see the darkness between the two thin halves of the card. Fake cards won't have this.

Quit while you’re ahead.",How to Win More Scratch Offs," Scratch-off lotto tickets are sold with varying odds, styles, and designs, but the easiest way to compare them is by price. Typically, scratch-off tickets cost between $1 and $20 a piece, depending on the game and the area in which you live. The cheaper tickets have a low percentage of overall winners, lower payouts, and a smaller spread between the top prize and interval prizes. More expensive tickets $5 and up, yield a higher overall percentage of winners, with a more even spread of higher-payouts, and usually a higher jackpot.


In other words, a dollar ticket may win more often, but the top prize may be a few hundred dollars, and the average prize will be much lower, while any given $20 ticket will win less often, but there is a very low probability that you could win several thousand dollars.;
, The odds listed for any particular game are the odds that any given ticket will be a winner. Just because some games present higher odds of winning than others doesn't mean you're more likely to win the jackpot, but it does make it a more valuable ticket for the price, given a large spread of lesser prizes. Buy tickets at your price point with the highest odds of any winner.


For a serious lottery player who wants to buy in bulk, the lower-price cards with higher odds is usually a better choice, while the occasional lottery player might do better to buy a more expensive ticket every now and then., Compare the odds of a few games before making an educated guess as to which card to buy. Typically, the odds are listed as a comparison of numbers: 1: 5, or 1: 20. This means that 1 out of every 5 or 20 tickets will be a winner.


It doesn't mean that every fifth ticket in a row wins, and it doesn't mean that in a random sampling of 20 tickets, one will definitely be a winner. It means that in the total number of tickets allotted, in all the stores across the state, that percentage of tickets are winners.

, There are rarely two winning tickets in a row, but there are at least a few winners in every roll of tickets. Therefore, if you know that a winning card has already been purchased from a given pack, stop playing for a couple days and come back, go to a different store, or buy a different game. This will ensure that you don’t spend money on an almost guaranteed loser.


Scratch-off tickets are sold with a guaranteed number of winners and losers in each pack, which is usually about 30 or 40 tickets. One way to guarantee that you'll win is to buy an entire pack.Now, you might end up not making a profit, but you'll end up winning something.

, Like slot machines and other games of chance, long streaks of losses mean that the odds get much more friendly when you swoop in with a well-timed purchase. Try talking to the cashier at a particular lotto shop to get good tips on which games have paid out and which haven't lately. You won't necessarily be able to know whether or not a particular ticket has a better chance than another, but you can know whether or not a game's already played out.If someone in front of you just bought ten tickets and lost on them all, buy a few. It's not a guarantee of a winner, but there's a better chance the next ticket in the roll will win if the previous ten didn't., Unfortunately, it's perfectly legal to sell tickets for a scratch off game after all of the top prizes have already been claimed. Sometimes the store will post a flyer with that information, but it is sometimes several weeks out of date. Checking with the state lottery homepage is the simplest way to make sure you aren’t wasting money on a loser.


If you have a favorite game at your price point and are considering buying some tickets, check out the top prize first before you head to the store. If it's lower than usual, because the top prizes have been claimed, think about switching to a different game in the same price point.

, Many places will run second-chance lottos, in which you can send in the old tickets from particular games for a drawing. Keep old tickets organized by game in an envelope, and go through it for second-chance opportunities when they're announced. Send them in and hope for the best. That losing ticket might still win you money.


Sometimes, the lottery commission will advertise these second-chance drawings when the top prizes have already been paid out, to try to drive the sales of essentially useless tickets. Buying tickets that will surely be losers just to have the second-chance opportunity isn't a great idea. Only use it for tickets you've already bought. Don't play a game just because it will be collected as a second-chance lotto ticket later.

, After you collect a few winners and want to turn them back in to collect your winnings, bring back your losing tickets too. Always have the computer at the retailer check the winnings to make sure you haven't missed anything. In games where there are several different ways to win prizes, it can be easy to overlook winnings. Having the computer check will ensure you don't accidentally throw away any winnings.


If you want to save tickets for second-chance opportunities, ask for them back and save them somewhere safe until the second-chance lotto is announced.

, Another technique some retailers use to repackage and clear out old stock is discounting ticket packages, made up of games in which the top winners have already been paid out. While it may seem like you're getting a deal, understand that the probabilities of a given ticket being a winner are completely skewed when the top prizes have already been claimed. It's better to focus on active games in which the numbers are more friendly and you actually stand the chance to win some real money.

, One Canadian professor was able to ""plunder"" tic-tac-toe scratch-offs by noticing a recurring pattern printed on winning tickets . If the printing on the outside of a scratch-off varies from card to card, pay attention to it.


The ""singleton method"" involves looking at the grid of printed numbers immediately to the left of a tic-tac-toe style scratch-off game, and analyzing the each matrix for patterns. If a single number appeared once on this game, it indicated a winner around 60% of the time.
Most states in which this manufacturing abnormality occurred have corrected the issue. Since most retailers and machines don't let you examine the tickets before you've purchased them, it's difficult to say there's much practical application of this skill, though it's still worth examining the ticket for any signs of tampering, or any patterns you might pick up on later and find your own manufacturing error.

, Decide how much you can afford to spend on a scratch-offs every week. This absolutely has to be money you can afford to lose, because you will lose money playing the lottery longterm. It's a guarantee.


When you've set a weekly budget, take money for scratch-offs from the leftover cash, not used for rent, groceries, or other necessary expenses. If you've got a fund set aside for fun stuff, you could take it out of there if you enjoy playing scratch-offs.
Never spend more than your budget. Resist the temptation to chase your losses. The statistics won't change in your favor.

, Lotto tickets may award consistency in the long run. Keep playing the game at your price point with the odds you like, until the top prize is paid out, then switch to another game. This helps to manage the psychological impact of winning and losing. Make it a rule: you can't play another game.


Some serious players differ on their philosophy regarding this. Alternatively, you could pick a store to always buy from, and buy different sorts of games from that store. Make one part of your buying routine consistent. Since there's always a higher-percentage chance of losing over winning, regardless of what you do, playing consistent is just one way of staying sane.

, If you win on a ticket, put the money in your wallet and leave the store. Don’t spend it on more scratch-offs beyond the budget you set, no matter how little. This alone will increase your income from scratch off wins, as using the winnings to invest in more money will most likely cause you to just lose them again. The numbers aren't your friend in the long-term.

Play more often.,
Play the odds.,
Remove randomness, or at least some of it.,
Buy in batches.,
Wait out the losers.",How to Win More Scratch Offs Without Doing Any Math1," You’ve surely heard people say “You have to play to win,” or “You can’t win if you don’t play,” and of course this is true. If you only care about winning more often, the best way to do so is to play scratch-offs more often.


Joan Ginther, the American who won roughly $20 million on mega-jackpot scratch-offs between 1993 and 2010, played a lot, buying thousands upon thousands of tickets. She surely beat the odds in some way or another to win so much money, but buying so many scratch-offs automatically meant she had more winning tickets.So, if you don’t care about losing some money, and simply enjoy the “high” of winning, just keep buying more tickets. If you want to improve your odds of winning, that’s another story.;
, Not all scratch-offs are created equal. Generally speaking, the larger the potential prize, the lower your odds are of winning it.


To put lottery odds in perspective, mega-jackpot lottery tickets based on number draws can have odds like 175 million to one, while a basic scratch-off may have 4:1 odds.You should be able to find the odds for any scratch-off game on the ticket itself, in the fine print of its advertising, or on the lottery website.
Scratch-offs with better odds cost less, so you can buy more and win more times, although you’re unlikely to get rich by winning $3 a pop. Focus on the fun of winning, not on making money.

, Unlike number-draw lottery games, which rely on a random series of numbered ping-pong balls, scratch-offs are not technically random. The lottery fixes the number of winning tickets and then tries to distribute the winners widely.Scratch-offs are sent to retailers in large packs with a roughly-equal number of winners in each pack. Winning tickets, especially in high-prize games, are also usually spread out geographically and over the life of the game.
Lotteries usually provide information on their websites regarding where winning tickets have been purchased, at least for scratch-offs with larger prizes. If you see an area within the lottery’s territory where winners seem to be in short supply, you can probably at least slightly improve your odds of winning by buying there., Because scratch-offs are not entirely random, and lottery operators usually try to spread out the winners, buying one kind of ticket in bulk can possibly net you more winners than spreading your purchase over several ticket types.Instead of buying one ticket every day, buy seven once a week or even 30 once a month. Since winners are usually spread out through the pack, you are more likely to end up with a winner this way., Since there are a set number of winners and a set number of tickets for sale for most scratch-off games, you can often improve your odds of picking a winning ticket simply by being patient.


Say, for instance, that a large-jackpot scratch-off promises three grand prize winners out of 120,000 tickets sold. If you wait until half the tickets have been sold, and know that only one grand prize has been won so far, you have already improved your odds of winning the big jackpot from 1:40,000 to 1:30,000. It might not seem like much, but it is an improvement.On a smaller (and somewhat sadder) level, there is another way to use patience to your advantage. You can hang around the store where the scratch-offs are sold and wait for someone who buys several tickets of the same game, scratches them, and fails to find a winner. Because winners are distributed roughly equally through each ticket pack, your odds of winning if you buy several of the same ticket immediately after are much improved. You may not want to gloat in front of the person who just lost $20, however."

Be wise with your winnings.,
Get help if you need it.",How to Win More Scratch Offs Without Doing Any Math2," Unless you crack the scratch-off code or are extraordinarily fortunate, the possibility that you will make money playing lottery tickets is remote at best. By playing less often, you lose less often, meaning that when you occasionally do win you are likely closer to breaking even.


Cautionary tales abound of people who sink thousands of dollars into buying scratch-offs, hoping to strike it rich, instead of saving or investing that money.If you think of scratch-offs as a fun diversion and assume that the money you spend on tickets will be lost, you will almost certainly end up better off in the end.

, Despite the tips provided in this article, there is only so much you can do to even slightly improve your odds of winning on scratch-offs. Simply buying more tickets won't help very much, and will more than likely just lose you more money.


Will buying ten tickets for $10 and getting two, $2 winners be that much less enjoyable than buying fifty tickets and getting ten winners? In one case, you’ve lost $6; in the other, you’ve lost $30. Enjoy the fun of playing in moderation, and you will probably be happier in the end.

, The lure of a winning ticket can be strong, and can overwhelm even the best of intentions to stick to a scratch-off budget.


When you go to buy tickets, try taking only as much cash as you need to buy your predetermined number of scratch-offs.
Also, don’t scratch the tickets until you get home, so you won’t be tempted to immediately cash in your winner for more tickets.

, It is tempting to think of any winnings as “found money” that should be folded back into buying more scratch-offs, but this strategy is most likely simply to turn it into “wasted money.”


The best idea is probably to never reinvest your winnings in new tickets. Stick to your budget for ticket-buying whether you win or lose.
If you can’t help but try to extend the thrill of winning, however, limit yourself to using half of your winnings to buy new tickets. Sock the rest away for another time and another purpose., Playing scratch-offs can be fun, but it can also become an obsession for some people. Lotteries are gambling, and gambling can be an addiction. If you feel like you’ve lost control, or know someone else who has, there many organizations that can help."

First, decide on what type of Pokémon you want to use.,
If you decide to use one type, great!,
Once you have decided on what types you want, find 8-14 energy cards that match the types you choose depending on the deck you build.,
Now it's time to choose your Pokémon!,
Choose Pokémon that have attacks that work well together.,
After you have decided on your Pokémon, it's time to select some of the most important cards of your deck; Trainer and Supporter cards.

,
Any trainer you choose should help your decks strategy for winning.,
Keep in mind, there are always Trainer cards (and Pokemon) in the Pokémon TCG that are useful in many deck.,
Also keep in mind that there are some Pokémon that go against the tips given above.",How to Build a Winning Pokémon Deck," There are eleven types to choose from. You can as many types as you want although it's recommended you use just one energy type (as in the energy of the attack). If you plan to use Pokémon in the deck that are support based and not to attack (one with a useful ability such as Hoopa-EX) then don't count this Pokemon's energy type when deciding on what type you choose;
, Just remember that you might not have much Pokémon to choose from that type. If you decide to use two or more types, you will have more Pokémon to choose from but will risk drawing the wrong energy cards during a game.

, Some may play more and some may play less but this is the average amount you will be using.

, Decks can have any number of Pokémon in them depending on the deck and play style. The only rule for Pokémon in the deck is that you must have at least 1 Basic Pokemon. Usually you will have 7-15 in the deck though you might end up with more if you play a deck with stage 2's. Here is some general advice on how to structure your Pokémon depending on what you choose.

, For example, if you decided to put Hippowdon (Rising Rivals 25) in your deck, consider also putting in Manectric (Platinum 11) in because Manectric can stop Hippowdon from hurting the Pokémon on your bench with its Electric Barrier Poke-body.

,, So, for example, if you have a deck that uses Stage 2's, you will want to use Rare Candy in the deck to skip the Stage 1 and speed up the deck to get right to the powerful attacks of the Stage 2. If you run a Grass deck, you will want to use the Stadium card Forest of Giant Plants because it lets you evolve any grass type immediately which will also speed up your deck (this does not work with Rare Candy so you don't want to use that case even in a stage 2 grass deck).

, These cards are called ""Staple cards"" and are constantly changing because of Pokemon's Rotation format. There are many guides online however that will list out the up to date list of the more useful cards in the game., For example, a BREAKthrough Typhlosion actually tends to run about 30 fire energy in it and a Greninja BREAK, even though it uses stage 2 Pokémon and isn't a grass type deck, does not use Rare Candy. Always consider what your plan is, how the Pokémon you use work and what will make these Pokémon function in the best way when building your deck."

Purchase more than one ticket.,
Join a lottery pool.,
Understand that the other tickets do not affect your tickets in most lotteries.,
Play less often, but buy more.,
Check and double-check your tickets.,
Quit while you're ahead.",How to Increase Your Chances of Winning a Lottery1," The more tickets purchased will increase your odds of winning.


Consider that an average state lottery has jackpot odds of about 100,000,000 to 1 -- it's often even worse: The multi-state ""Powerball"" lottery has jackpot odds of about 185,000,000 to 1. Holding fifty tickets only would improve your odds to 100,000,000 to 50.;
, Get a group together at your office, school, church, activity center or any place where others are willing to share a winning ticket.


The payout that you receive will be less because you will be sharing it, but your chances of winning are slightly increased.

,


Many people erroneously think that they have better chances of winning when fewer people play, but this is not true unless you are entering a raffle wherein a winning ticket is pulled from all the entries.
The odds of the lottery's random numbers matching your ticket's numbers are not affected by the number of people who have tickets. Think of it this way: If only one person bought just one ticket for the lottery is that person guaranteed to win? No.
However, the fewer people who play, the lower the odds of multiple winners are.

, This increases your chances for that specific play.


This strategy does not affect your odds of winning in your lifetime but can affect what jackpot you win, if you win.
Instead of buying a ticket every week save up the money you would spend and use it to buy tickets when the jackpot reaches large amounts. This maximizes the return without increasing your financial risk.
You don't need to use the same numbers every time - it does not increase your odds of winning. Previous draws have no effect on future draws - each draw is a clean slate - so feel free to change your numbers each time.
People who play the same numbers every week can become 'addicted' to the lottery over fears that their usual numbers will come up if they do not buy a ticket. Using different numbers each week can help you stay in control of your gambling, and does not affect your odds of winning.
In lotteries where a winner is drawn from a raffle, you increase your odds of winning by playing the week after a huge jackpot - as typically fewer people play the lottery after a big cash prize has been won.

, Sometimes, there are several ways to win. Make sure not to assume you lost and thoroughly look over your tickets.

, Getting a series of winners will only add up if you cease buying.


Set a budget and stick with it. If possible, use the lottery money you've won to purchase future tickets. That way, you dip less frequently into your main income.

Look up the frequency chart for previous lottery draws.,
Choose your numbers based on the frequency chart.,
Acknowledge that each number still has an equal chance of being drawn.",How to Choose Lottery Numbers1," Most state lottery programs offer charts showing how often each number has been drawn during a given time frame. For instance, it shows how often the number 1 was chosen as a Powerball number between 1997 and 2015. You can view a Powerball frequency chart via the Iowa State Lottery. here).If you can look up the all-time frequencies, that's the best possible data set for you to analyze. It’s more comprehensive, and you should base your numbers on as large a time frame as possible.
There's no clear way to know if you should be looking up frequent winning numbers or numbers that come up less frequently. Look up both types of numbers and play sequences with a combo of both if you wish.
However, winning numbers that come up more frequently are likely to remain frequent winners. If you play a number that doesn't come up as frequently, then you simply may need to wait a while to see if it comes up when its ""due"" to win.
Make sure you're looking up the right frequency chart for the lottery game you plan to play. For instance, Powerball stats will differ from Mega Millions stats.;
, Review the numbers that are the most frequently chosen and the least frequently chosen. Review the odds for those as well as the numbers in between.After you've looked over the odds, you have two options:


Select numbers that are drawn frequently. If you notice that a few numbers stand out for being drawn significantly more often than the others, consider including them in your pick. Be aware, though, that several other people will be trying this tactic; if you win with frequently picked numbers, you might be at a greater risk of having to share the prize with other winners.
Select numbers that are drawn less frequently. Choosing numbers that aren't picked very often might seem counterintuitive, but consider this: If everyone else is busy picking frequently drawn numbers and you win with your “long-shot” picks, you might not have to share the prize with as many other winners.

, Looking at frequency charts might show you which numbers tend to be drawn, but keep in mind that when the actual lottery drawing comes around, each number still has an absolutely equal chance of being picked. It’s all in the luck of the draw."
"
Weigh your odds.",How to Increase Your Chances of Winning a Lottery2," The jury is still out. More people win via quick picks (in Powerball)-- but more people use quick picks. Statistically, the odds are the same that any combination of numbers will be picked. So, it doesn’t matter if you choose lucky numbers or let the machine choose for you.Though it may seem illogical, 1-2-3-4-5-6 is just as likely as a random selection of 6 numbers.
The only drawback of self picks is that humans are all generally programmed the same. That is, your favorite numbers are probably someone else's favorite numbers. So, if you win on 7-14-21-28-35-42, you may have to share.
Richard Lustig, 7-time lottery winner, highly advises against quick picks.He argues that picking your own numbers keeps you from getting combinations of recent winners (so long as you've done your research!), thus increasing your chances..

If you are playing your state's lottery, don't bother checking to see if old winning numbers are available online. Just because a number recently came up, that doesn't alter the odds of it coming up again. Today's randomly selected numbers aren't affected by any other day's randomly selected number.

Invest in smaller payouts.",How to Increase Your Chances of Winning a Lottery3," Smaller reward — more likely to win? Maybe. Mohan Srivastava, a statistician living in Toronto, says he broke the code. His story certainly involves a lot of time for a rather small payout. A typical scratchcard has odds between 1:5 and 1:2.5. Consider this when picking out your scratchers.
Ask the clerk which ones have been bought the most and returned the most winners. Pick a game that has seen mostly losses -- that way, a win should be coming up. If the odds are 1:5, purchasing 5 cards should allot you 1 winner.

Add the first lottery number and the second delta number together.",How to Choose Lottery Numbers2," The Delta Lotto method is way to choose lottery numbers based on a statistical study of numbers that are next to each other. This information has been related back to winning lottery numbers, which has formed the basis for this method. In other words, the delta method is based on research, but keep in mind there’s no guarantee you’re going to win if you choose your numbers this way., The number should be between 1 and 5. For instance, the number 1 is a good number to choose because often, more than 60% of the time, the number 1 is part of the winning delta numbers included in the series. However, feel free to choose another low number that you feel good about such as 3 or 5 There is no exact science. Example: 1

, There are a number of combinations that you could choose from. For instance, you could choose 3 and 5. Or, 2 and 6 could be an option. You could also choose two consecutive numbers like 7 and 8. Example: 3 and 5 Sequence: 1-3-5

, It can be above the number 8 , such as the number 9. Or, it can be below, for instance, 7. For the fourth number, pick something pretty close to 8 ,either above or below it. Example:9 Sequence 1-3-5-9

, Choose two numbers a few numbers away from each other such as 11 and 13. Another option could be 14 and 9 or 10 and 14. Choose the numbers randomly or choose your favorite numbers between the given range. The smaller number doesn’t have to be listed first. Example: 11 and 13 Sequence: 1-3-5-9-11-13.

, Once you have selected 6 numbers in the method described, you have created a six-digit lottery number sequence. Write it down in the order that you selected them. In our example, the numbers are 1-3-5-9-11-13

, Make sure the sum of the numbers is not greater than the highest number allowed in the game you’re playing. For instance, if the highest lottery number you can play is 56, then our numbers are within the range because the total sum equals 42. 1 +3+5+9+11+13 = 42


If your is within about about 15 from the total but not greater than the total, then you have selected some good numbers.
If you need to select different numbers so that you sum is not greater than the highest lottery number, then do so.
It’s okay if numbers repeat themselves where applicable. For instance, you’re number close to 8 could be the number 9, and you could also select 9 for your number between 8 and 15. If you need to do this to make sure that your sum total is not greater, that is fine. Remember numbers sometimes repeat in winning lottery numbers.

, Delta numbers aren’t usually in sequential order. So, change the numbers around a bit. Put the first number last and the last number first. Put the numbers in the middle at the end or beginning. Rearrange them so that they are in a different order. For example, our numbers rearranged could be 1-3-5-9-11-13 or it could be 5-3-11-9-1-13. There are a number of different variations that you could have., For now, our delta series is 5-3-11-9-1-13. This is not your final lottery number. You will use these numbers to create your lottery number sequence.

, The first delta number of the series becomes the first lottery number of your lottery sequence. It remains unchanged. However, the remainder of the numbers will be added together to create the lottery numbers. For example:, the first lottery number is 5. Example: 5

, (5 +3 =8) This sum of these two become your second lottery number, the number 4. Repeat this for the rest of the delta numbers. Adding the sum of the numbers next to each other is how you create each number in the series to create your final lottery number sequence. If our delta numbers are 5-3-11-9-1-13, then our lottery numbers are created in the following way:


The first lottery number is 5. Example: 5-
The second lottery number is created by adding the first lottery number to the second delta number. For our example, we get 8 as the sum of 5 and 3. The number 8 is our second lottery number. For example, the number ares 5,8 so far. Example: 5-8-
Add the second lottery number to the third delta number. For example, the number 8 is our second lottery number. Our third delta number is 11. For instance, the number 8 plus 11 equals 19. ( 8+11 =19) So, nineteen is our third lottery number. For example, the lottery numbers are 5,8,19 so far. Example: 5-8-19-
Add the third lottery number and the fourth delta number. In our case, 19 is our third lottery number and 9 is our fourth delta number. For instance, 19 plus 9 equals 28. (19+9 = 28) Twenty-eight is our fourth lottery number. The numbers are 5,8,19 and 28 thus far. Example 5-8-19-28-
Add the fourth lottery number and the fifth delta number. For our example, 28 is our fourth lottery number and 1 is our fifth delta number. Twenty-eight plus 1 equals 29. (28 +1 = 29) So, Twenty-nine is our fifth lottery number. Thus far, the numbers are 5,8,19, 28 and 29. Example: 5-8-19-28-29-
Add the fifth lottery number and the sixth delta number. In this case, 29 is our fifth lottery number and 13 is our sixth delta number. 29 + 13 =42 . Forty-two is our sixth lottery number. The lottery numbers are 5,8,19,28,29 and 42 so far. Example: 5-8-19-28-29-42
Our final lottery numbers are 5-8-19-28-29-42. Now, your numbers are ready to play. Repeat the process again to create another delta number.

Choose numbers that are significant to you.,
Choose numbers you consider lucky.,
Choose a lucky number and stick with it.",How to Choose Lottery Numbers3," If you believe in lucky numbers, they're probably digits that center around important dates or events in your life. Mix the numbers of significant numbers together. For instance, you might use your grandfather’s birthday month and year,10/1929 and your mother’s birth month and day, 3/21. Together you might come up with something like 10-19-3-21-29. Other examples of significant numbers might include::


Birthdays: Yours, your children's, your spouse's, and so on.
Anniversaries: This could be a wedding anniversary date, or the date of another significant event.
Ages: Using your age or the ages of your loved ones is also a common practice.
Addresses: The address of your childhood or current home is another tactic you can try.
Phone numbers: Try breaking down your phone number into a sequence of single- or double-digit lotto numbers.

, Some folks have a lucky number they use for everything. It isn't connected a birthday or anything like that, they just like the number. If this is the case for you, add your lucky number to your lottery number. You never know. You might get lucky!


If you're playing a lottery game such as Powerball, consider making your lucky number the Powerball pick.
Also if you’re lucky numbers are 7 and 11 lucky, keep in mind that those are really common lottery picks. If you win with these numbers on your ticket, you might end up sharing the prize with a lot of people.

, Some people choose a number sequence that they consider lucky and play it over and over again until it comes up a winner -- if it ever does. For instance, if you’re favorite number sequence is your favorite number, combined with your birthday and your spouse’s lucky number and birthday (3-6-11-9-10-31), then you would play this number religiously every time you play the lottery. Then, you wait for your number to come up a winner. This could be considered making your own luck.

Find a random number generator.,
Use a random number generator for single numbers.,
Use ""lotto pick"" computer generated numbers.",How to Choose Lottery Numbers4," Random.org has a number generator specifically designed for lottery picks. The advantage of using random draws is that winning lottery numbers are chosen randomly as well. So, it might be a lucky draw.


Choose how many tickets you want. Then, choose the country or state in which you’re playing.
Choose the lottery game that you’re playing such as Powerball, Nebraska-Pick 5, etc. You are able to choose specific games for each state.
Choose how many numbers are available in the draw. For instance, a five sequence number such as 5-10-14-2-6-7. Or, is it a six sequence number like 11-5-3-9-15-24.
Chose the highest number in the sequence. For instance, if any number up to 59 is available to play, the sequence 6-59-30-15-5 is a viable lottery number. The number 60-3-67-3-10-5-1 is not.Then, click pick tickets. The settings and the site will calculate a number for you., If you still want to have a little control over your numbers, you could use a random number generator to choose individual numbers. For instance, you could choose the parameters such as a number between 1 and 30. Then, let the random number choose. Do that for each number.


You also could follow the steps of the delta method except instead of picking the numbers yourself, you could allow the random number generator to do it. You simply set the parameters for each step of the process., Allow the lottery to choose randomly for you. You can request random picks when you purchase your lottery ticket. When the attendant asked you for the numbers, tell him or her that you want the system to choose the numbers for you. With the click of a few buttons, you’ll have your lottery numbers. If you're buying several tickets at one time, this is probably the way to go.

Examine the card.,
Do a card excavation.,
Decide on the type of the deck.,
Set aside 20-25 spaces for energy cards, balancing out the two different types of energy.,
Set aside 20-25 spaces for trainer, supporter, stadium, and special energy cards.,Separate your loose Pokémon into basic, stage 1, and stage 2.,Look through the stage 1 cards and choose a few (not too many or you risk not getting a basic in the first hand) that you think would help your deck.,
Look through the basics and find a basic for each evolution card you chose.,
Look through the stage 2 cards and look for any of them that evolve from the stage 1 cards you have.,
Figure out if any of your Level X cards level up if you have some in your loose cards or deck.,
Look through the basics again and pick out a mix of a bunch of strong and average basics.,

Check your cards, make sure that powerful cards like ACE SPEC.",How to Build a Deck Around a Pokémon," Look at its HP, weakness, resistance, attacks, retreat cost, and any other serious downfall that you can't handle. Many very powerful cards are balanced by retreat cost, weakness and extra effects of its attacks, including discarding energy, coin flips and even damaging itself. If these effects are too much for your deck to handle even with the proper techniques, you should not build a deck around it. It is also a bad idea to base a deck around weaker Pokémon. Including a few may be a good idea, but going out of your way to support them in a deck is not.
, Look through all of your loose Pokémon cards, trade with other people for the cards you want, and steal cards that you need in your new deck out of your other decks (if you have any). Look through the cards you find to see if any could be useful in your deck., If one of the key Pokémon's attacks require 2 different kinds of energy, then that should be the type of your deck. If it only requires 1 type of energy, that has to be one of the types, and the other can be one of your choice, preferably one that covers its weakness or has Pokémon that can benefit the key Pokémon. If the key Pokémon requires no energy types (all colorless energy) to use its attacks, you can choose the 2 types that would work best with the deck, whichever ones they may be.,

Special energy cards. These are optional, but they can be helpful if you can find any. Most have negative effects or conditions in order to use them to their full extent, so they are another risk.

, Do not add them yet, but leave the spaces open. Keep in mind you don't have to add as many trainer cards as you made space for, you can add fewer if necessary, and fill it in with energy or Pokémon.,,, Add as many of the basics as you can find, and if necessary, trade for more., There should be even less stage 2 cards in your deck, and if a Pokémon can't hold its own in battle without evolving all the way to stage 2, don't put it in your deck, because you never know when you'll draw the cards you need., Remember not to overdo it on Level X cards, and only add them if they fit well into your deck. Never put a Pokémon into your deck just to get to the level X card, because you might not get it in battle. Again, your cards should be powerful or at least able to hold up in battle without evolving or leveling up., Remember that they have to fit into your deck., If there is anything to do, do it and look over it again until you are satisfied. Remember, if you can trade for something that would fit well with your deck, do it as soon as you can, because it is hard to maintain the balance of 60 cards., You should add a lot of trainer cards that fit in your deck. Some great staples for your deck that are relatively common include: rare candies (a varying range depending on how many evolution cards are in your deck), Potions (as many as you can find), Switch (as many as you can find), Life Herbs (as many as you can find), Energy Search (as many as you can find), PlusPower (as many as you can find), and cards that reuses discarded ones. Don't forget to add varying other trainer cards depending on your deck. Remember that with trainer cards, more is better, especially if they require coin flips, so put as many of the same trainer card as you can find into your deck, but you can't have more than four of any card except basic energy., You don't really need Pokémon tools, but if you find ones that fit with your deck, you should add them., Supporters are necessities, and what kind you add should be based on your deck. Target the main things you need in your deck (like drawing power, energy searching, and many other things). You should add Supporters that help you find and increase the power of your key Pokémon, but that shouldn't be the only Pokémon it benefits., These are optional, but if you find ones that benefit you greatly, you should add them. But remember, they can benefit your opponent too, so be wary.,,, and Pokémon can be managed right."

Gather the following information:


T = How many lottery tickets will be sold
W = How many tickets sold will be winners
P = How many tickets you are planning to buy

,
Write down your first fraction: (T-W)/T.,
Simplify the fraction (punch 22999000 divided by 23000000 into a calculator to get a decimal, in this case 0.99995652173913043478260869565217) and jump to the Subtract step if you only bought one ticket.,
Write more fractions by reducing the previous numerators and denominators by one, until the total number of fractions is equal to P, the number of tickets you are planning to buy.,
Multiply all of the fractions together.,
Subtract the result from 1 to get the probability of having AT LEAST ONE winner among the tickets you purchased.,
Invert the fraction.,
Convert the decimal into a fraction.,
Calculate your chances.,
Use this equation: Chance of Win = * 100, which for P = 1 would reduce to: Chance of Win = W/T * 100.,
Convert to a fraction as above.",How to Figure Your Odds of Holding a Winning Lottery Ticket,", For the moment, don't simplify the fraction by reducing it to lowest terms.


For example, suppose the lottery will sell 23,000,000 tickets, there will be 1,000 winning tickets, and you are planning to buy 6 tickets. Then T = 23000000, W = 1000, and P = 6. The first fraction will be (23000000-1000)/23000000 = 22999000/23000000.

, If you bought more than one ticket, skip this step.

, If you bought 6 tickets in the above example, these are the fractions you should come up with:


22999000/23000000

This is your first fraction, from an earlier step.


22998999/22999999

This is the result of subtracting one from each of the numbers in your first fraction; the following fractions continue this pattern.


22998998/22999998
22998997/22999997
22998996/22999996
22998995/22999995

, There are two ways to do this. You can multiply all of the numerators, then multiply all the denominators, and then divide the numerator product by the denominator product. Or, if you have a calculator that can generate long decimals (such as the standard calculator in your computer), simplify all of the fractions (numerator divided by denominator to generate a decimal) and then multiply all of the decimals together. The resulting number is the probability of having NO winners among the tickets you purchased.


The 5 fractions in this example generate these decimals, respectively:

0.99995652173913043478260869565217
0.99995652173724007553217719705118
0.99995652173534971611736661890145
0.99995652173345935653817693976221
0.99995652173156899679460813819272
0.99995652172967863688666019275222


Since you have 5 fractions, you must multiply the resulting decimals together, which in this case results in 0.99973915876017716698091198324496

,


1 - 0.99973915876017716698091198324496 = 0.000260841239822833019088016756
For ease of calculation, let's cut it down to .0002608412

, Press the ""1/x"" or ""x -1"" button on your calculator to invert the fraction you calculated in the previous step. 1 / .0002608412 ~= 3834, meaning that you have about a 1 in 3834 chance of holding at least one winning ticket. If your calculator doesn't have this function, skip this step and move on to the next.

, Count the number of characters after the decimal point, as that will be the number of zeros following 1 in your denominator; to get the numerator, take the decimal point and any preceding zeros away.


.0002608412 has 10 characters after the decimal point, so your denominator is 10,000,000,000 (1 followed by 10 zeros)
Without the decimal and the preceding zeros, .0002608412 = 2608412
Your fraction is 2,608,412/10,000,000,000

, Divide the denominator by the numerator. In this case, 10,000,000,000 divided by 2,608,412 equals 3,834 (when rounded). This corresponds to about 1 chance in 3,834 of holding at least one winning ticket.

, The resulting number is your percentage of winning. Using the numbers from the example above, this equation tells us that we have a 0.026084% (less than three one-hundredths of a percent) chance of winning.;
, Before multiplying by 100 to obtain the percentage, you will have calculated ~0.00026084. Create a fraction as from this as in the last steps of the first method above, so that you have 26084/100,000,000 (8 zeros after the one in this case because there are only 8 digits after the decimal point). Divide the denominator by the numerator, and your answer, when rounded, is 3,834--the same number you would have arrived at by use of the longer method.

Enter as many times as possible.,

Follow the requirements to claim your prize.",How to Win Sweepstakes," It's not too hard to find sweepstakes. You can enter them at the grocery store, at the bank, at fundraisers, or on the internet. You might even get invitations to enter sweepstakes in the mail! You probably want to enter most of these sweepstakes of course, but if you're really serious about winning, you need to actively seek out sweepstakes.


Start reading the newspaper and going through your mail more carefully.
Carry a notepad and pen with you to jot down the details of any sweepstakes you might see on TV or hear on the radio.
Search the Internet. There are even online databases, some free and some by subscription only, that can clue you in to hundreds or thousands of sweepstakes.;
, Not all sweepstakes are created equal. For one thing, if you have to buy something to have a chance to win, don't enter. If you have to complete some sort of program (which usually entails buying things) to enter—–those annoying pop-ups for free iPods come to mind—–don't enter (unless it's realistic to complete and free); remember that a lot of these opportunities are about gathering personal information to bug you with advertising down the track. There are plenty of chances to win without jumping through hoops or wasting your money. Beyond that, your decision to enter should be based on your own preferences. Here are a few things to consider.


What can you win? Sweepstakes with a large sum of prize money are almost always worth entering, just because it's so much money. Sweepstakes with smaller prizes can be great because you generally have a more realistic chance of winning. However, don't waste your time entering a sweepstakes for a prize you don't want or couldn't easily sell for a good profit.
Will your privacy be protected? Unfortunately, the answer to this question is almost certainly ""no"". Ask yourself: is a lifetime of junk mail, spam, or even sales calls worth the small chance of winning the prize? Probably not. Different sweepstakes offer different degrees of privacy, and they should disclose what they will do with your personal information. Read the fine print, and if you're not comfortable with their use of your information, don't enter. Keep in mind that even companies who claim to respect your privacy will probably sell it anyway; this type of fraud, though illegal, is very common and very difficult to enforce against. This is an especially pervasive problem with online sweepstakes, as they'll often sell your email address to spammers who will bombard you with unwanted emails. That said, keep in mind that you can't really expect something for nothing, and sometimes you may decide that giving away some information is worth the chance of winning the prize.

, You usually don't know what the exact odds of winning are because it will depend on the number of entries. You can, however, estimate the odds. If you get an entry form in the mail for a sweepstakes with a huge prize, you can be assured of a ridiculous number of entries. If you see a jar at a local restaurant for a free lunch, however, you know your odds of winning will be much greater––you may even be able to see how many entries are in the jar.


The number of entries will generally depend on the size of the prize, the range of the target audience (local contests usually have better odds than national contests), the duration of the sweepstakes (a weekly drawing is better than a monthly drawing), and how well publicized the sweepstakes is.
You'll also want to consider how many prizes will be given away. A contest that receives hundreds of thousands of entries but offers a thousand prizes has odds of hundreds-to-one. That means you would likely need to enter hundreds of times in order to win even a single prize.
Does this all mean that you shouldn't bother with big contests? Maybe not, unless they're offering big prizes or plentiful prizes.

, You can't expect to win if you don't play by the rules. Go through the contest rules with a fine-tooth comb. Some are very simple, but others are not. If you don't follow the rules exactly, your entry will be disqualified. The good news is that many people don't follow the rules, a fact which increases your chances of winning. One rule that almost all sweepstakes have is an entry deadline. You've got to beat the deadline or you won't win.

, Make sure that other people can read everything you write on your sweepstakes entries, particularly your contact information. If you have atrocious handwriting, consider typing your entries if the rules allow it. If not, ask someone with neat handwriting to write it out for you.

, Some sweepstakes require that you answer a question correctly. There's no point in entering these if you don't have the right answer, so check and double-check the accuracy of your answer before sending in your entry.

, The more times you enter, the better your odds. It's as simple as that. Before you send in a million entries, however, make sure you know how many entries the rules allow you. If you send in one too many, you'll be disqualified. Additionally, rules may stipulate ""one entry per day"" or ""one entry per envelope."" If you're having to pay postage for each entry, consider your budget, and don't get carried away, especially if the prize isn't worth much.


Bring entry forms home. If you can just drop your entries into a box, take some entry forms home with you so that you can fill out as many as the rules permit without feeling crunched for time.
Space out your entries. Assuming that the number of times you can enter is constrained, either by the rules or by your budget, don't send in or drop in all your entries at one time. Wait a few days or weeks (depending on the contest) between entries so that when the entries get mixed together you've got a better chance of one of your entries landing on top.

, There isn't much you can do to distinguish your entry online, but for paper entries it doesn't hurt to give yourself a little competitive edge.


Use a large envelope. Many mail-in sweepstakes simply drop the envelopes into a big bin and have someone pull one out. A bigger envelope has a better chance of being pulled. Many sweepstakes, however, have rules regarding the size of envelope or postcard you can use, so you can't always use this trick.
Decorate your entry. Sometimes the person picking the entry will be blindfolded, but many times they will not be. Set your entry apart by using a brightly colored envelope, applying stickers, or otherwise decorating the entry (within the rules, of course) so that it catches the eye.
Fold your entry in a unique way. For drop-your-entry-in-the-box sweepstakes, fold each entry so that it's attractive and bulky. An accordion-style folding job or some simple origami may make your entry more likely to be picked over all those entries that are simply folded down the middle.

, Once you've won, you've still got to make sure you get your prize, and that usually requires you filling out some affidavits, possibly notarized, or completing some kind of paperwork in a timely fashion. Follow through on claiming your prize, and make sure you meet any deadlines. Watch out for scams, though (see Warnings section below).


You may need to agree to being photographed and having your photo displayed online or in a newspaper article. If this isn't something you want to happen, read the fine print before entering.

Remember that ""the house always wins!""",How to Buy a Lottery Ticket," When it comes to buying lottery tickets, it's generally best to budget out the money you intend to spend before you even see your ticket. Doing this allows you to be a smart gambler by limiting your spending — this way, there's less of a chance that you' ll feel tempted to bet more money than you can stand to lose.


In addition, if you're not 100% sure about whether the lottery is legal in your state or country, you may want to check online. In the United States, 43 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have lotteries.You can check whether your state has a lottery here.;
, If lottery tickets are legal in your state, you'll generally be able to buy them at grocery stores (especially large chains), convenience stores, and gas stations. Though not every single one of these locations will carry and sell lottery tickets, many will. A good general rule is, ""if you can buy cigarettes at this place, there's a good chance you can buy lottery tickets"".


Many lotteries have online tools that can help you locate licensed retailers. For instance, the California State Lottery's online retailer locator allows you to search for vendors near any given address in the state., Like smoking, drinking, and other forms of gambling, playing the lottery is usually something that isn't legal until someone reaches a certain age. This can vary from state to state and country to country. In the United States, the most common minimum age for playing the lottery is 18, though exceptions exist.When you attempt to buy a lottery ticket, you may be asked to present identification in order to prove that you're old enough to legally play.


For a list of lottery-playing ages in every U.S. state and territory, click here.

, All lotteries are different, but most share certain qualities when it comes to how you make your bet. Generally, if you want to buy a lotto ticket, when you get to the store, you'll ask for your desired ticket (many states and countries have more than one lottery game for you to choose from), then pick the numbers you want to bet on. This is usually done by marking the numbers in a grid on an official lottery playslip. When you've picked the numbers you want, give your playslip back.


As an example, let's look at the Powerball Lottery, a lottery played in most U.S. states that often has a very high jackpot amount. To bet on this lottery, you'll need to pick five numbers from 1-59 (without repeating) and one number from 1-35. On the playslip, you'll see a grid with the number 1-59 and another section with the numbers 1-35. Mark five numbers in the first section and one in the second as directed, then turn your playslip in.

, If you're in a hurry or you simply don't care which numbers you pick, most modern lotteries allow you to let a computer randomly pick a number for you. Usually, in this case, there will be a box or section on the playslip for you to mark to indicate that you accept whatever set of numbers the computer picks for you. If you pick this option, you don't have to indicate any numbers on the playslip.


For example, the Powerball Lottery gives you the option to select ""Quick Pick"" on your ticket, which will assign you five random numbers from 1-59 and one from 1-35. You can also limit the Quick Pick to just the first set of five numbers or the final 1-35 number., When you buy a lottery ticket, you don't find out if you've won right away. Instead, you have to wait for the official lottery drawing, in which a set of winning numbers are chosen at random. If you pay only the base price for your ticket, it will expire after one draw and you'll have to buy a new one if you want to play again. However, many lotteries allow you to pay for more than one draw at once. In other words, if you buy a set of ten draws at ten times the price of a normal ticket, you'll be able to use your set of numbers for ten drawings in a row.


Most lotteries that allow you to do this will have a space on the playslip for you to mark to indicate how many draws you want to pay for. For instance, in the Powerball Lottery, this section is labeled ""Advanced Play"" and contains the option to indicate two through eight or ten consecutive draws., When you've finished filling out your playslip, give it a quick review to ensure that everything is filled out exactly how you'd like it. Then, turn it in and pay for your bets — keep in mind that, for multiple draws, each draw will be the price of an additional ticket. You'll be handed a ticket (which serves as your receipt) in return. You may need to sign the back of this ticket to validate it.


Don't lose this ticket — it's proof that you purchased your specific set of lottery numbers.
If you notice any mistakes on your ticket, don't attempt to erase and rewrite them, as this can interfere with the computer's ability to read the ticket. Instead, most tickets will have a space for you to mark ""Void"" or ""Cancel"". Mark this box, then carefully re-make your selections on another section of the playslip.

, When you've purchased your set of numbers and have your ticket with you, you can leave. Now, all you need to do is wait for the next official drawing. Different lotteries have their drawing at different dates and times — you can find the next drawing for your lottery by asking the clerk at your preferred retailer or checking your lottery's official website. Drawing results are displayed on official lottery websites and, for small local lotteries, sometimes on public access television.


For instance, for the Powerball, drawings occur every Wednesday and Saturday at about 7:59 PM Pacific Time.The cutoff for each draw is at 7:00 PM on the day of the draw. Tickets purchased after this point count towards the next draw.
If your numbers match the numbers drawn perfectly, you've won! If they match partially, you may have won — check your lottery's official payout rules for more information.
If you miss a draw, don't forget to look up the results online! Lottery tickets (including Powerball tickets) usually do expire.If you have a winning ticket, especially for the jackpot prize, it is best to consult a financial adviser before claiming your prize.

, If you don't live somewhere where the lottery is legal but you still want to play, consider buying tickets online. Many online lottery vendors offer a service where you pay the site to buy a ticket for you. If you win, the site sends you your winnings. Using this system, it's relatively simple to play in lotteries in places you don't live. However, before exchanging any money, you'll want to ensure that the site you're using is reputable and professionally-run. Online lottery sites aren't well-regulated, so it's smart to use a website review repository like Sitejabber to find good sites or try one of the reputable sites below:


Lotteryuniverse.com
Congalotto.com
Lottogopher.com (California only but with plans to expand)

, The legal situation surrounding the process of buying and selling lottery tickets online is a murky, nebulous one, especially in the United States. Technically, state lotteries only have the legal right to sell their tickets within the state's borders. Online lottery vendors get around this hurdle by acting only as ""service agencies"" — you give them your money, they buy the ticket for you legally, then send you your money if you win. It's not hard to guess that this practice is the subject of some legal controversy, so double-check the local laws where you live before spending any money on online lotto tickets.


At the very least, you'll want to ensure that you're old enough to legally play the lottery. Minimum lottery-playing ages in the U.S. are available here.
Note that some U.S. states, like Illinois, have recently allowed online lotto ticket sales.However, at presents, these states can only sell to residents online.

, Because most online lottery ticket services allow you to buy tickets at face value, they sometimes try to make money by requiring their users to register an account with the site and pay a subscription fee. This fee is usually fairly cheap — often on the order of $10 per month — and is often reduced if the user pays for an extended membership. Some sites offer the ability to buy tickets for free but offer extra features to paying members.


For instance, Lottogopher.com offers a free service, but also offers an enhanced service with extra features to customers who opt to pay either $12 per month or $99 per year., All online lottery ticket vendors should give you the ability to pick precisely the numbers and options you want on your ticket as you normally would. First, pick your numbers, then choose the number of draws you'd like, then choose any additional options and proceed to the checkout phase.

, Like almost all online retailers, online lottery vendors allow you to review your order on a ""checkout"" screen before confirming your payment information. Make sure everything is in order, then proceed to input your payment information, address, and personal information as required.


Most online lottery vendors will require a valid email address so that they can notify you when you win prizes. Additionally, in the U.S., state lotteries will require you to provide an in-state address.

, After you make your order, your payment account will be debited the cost of your purchase and you'll be sent a confirmation of your order via email. At this point, all that's left to do is wait. If your ticket wins a prize, you will be notified and you'll have the option to cash out your winnings.

, One extremely common, easy-to-play alternative to the traditional lottery ticket is the scratch-off. Though these types of tickets are often not technically part of a state or country's official lottery, they are still frequently referred to as ""lottery tickets"", ""scratch-off lottery tickets"", and so on. These tickets, which usually are sold in vending machines, take the form of small, brightly decorated cards with portions that can be scratched off to reveal whether or not you've won a prize underneath. The payouts for these types of tickets are usually fairly small, especially compared to large lotteries like Powerball and Mega Millions, but, at around $1-$5 per ticket, they do offer a quick, fun way to play for cash that virtually anyone can afford.


All scratch-off tickets are different, so consult the directions on your scratch off to learn how to play. Most involve scratching off some (or all) of the scratch-able surfaces to reveal numbers which can win you a prize if they match a designated ""winning number""
While scratch-offs may not always be run or sanctioned by your state or country's official lottery, in most cases, you do still have to be 18 years or older to play.

, Another quick, easy way to play the lottery is to buy a pull-tab ticket. Pull tab tickets are played by matching the numbers on the back of the ticket to one of the winning combinations on the front. Usually, the numbers on the back of the ticket are hidden behind a perforated paper tab which must be broken open to view them. If the back of your ticket contains any of the winning combinations on the front, you win. Like scratch-offs, pull-tabs are fairly cheap (as low as $1 or less) and have fairly small payouts.


As with scratch-offs, these types of tickets are often sold out of vending machines. Unlike scratch-offs, the vending machines that sell these tickets often (but not always) appear old-fashioned, featuring metal construction and a simple coin-operated mechanism for getting your ticket.

, Keno is a type of game that resembles traditional lottery-style gambling. Some states offer Keno games as part of their official lottery, while, elsewhere, Keno can be played in casinos and gambling houses. Though there are many different regional varieties of Keno, the most common version involves picking from 1-20 numbers between 1 and 80. Each additional number you pick costs you more money. At the end of the betting period, 20 random numbers are drawn from the pool of 80. The more numbers you chose that match the ones picked, the more you win (though there are often special prizes for hitting zero numbers as well).


Keno can have especially ""long odds"" — in other words, it can be extra-unlikely that you'll win with this game. Depending on the rules of a given Keno game, the casino's mathematical advantage can be as high as 25-35%.The official odds for picking all 20 numbers perfectly in a standard Keno game lie somewhere around 1 in 3.5 quintillion! Generally, guessing between 2 and 8 numbers correctly offers the greatest chance of a payout.

, Many lotteries in the US and Canada offer the option to play a quick variant on traditional lotto games called ""Pick Three"" (or, in Canada, often ""Pick Four""). The rules are simple — simply pick three numbers from 0-9, then choose whether you want to play your numbers in the exact order you picked them, or in any order. The former option is cheaper, but offers slimmer odds of winning. Finally, pick your bet, choose your number of draws, and turn your ticket in, as you would with an ordinary lottery ticket. Check the next drawing — if your numbers match in the order you chose, you win!


Pick Four plays identically, but with four numbers instead of three.
Note that Pick Three/Four drawings often occur multiple times per day., It's important to remember that, no matter which lottery game you choose, your odds of winning money in the long-term are practically non-existent. Like the games in a casino, lottery games are mathematically designed to make money for the person or agency running the lottery at the expense of the people playing the game. While someone will occasionally get lucky and become fabulously rich from a lucky jackpot win, this is obviously very, very rare. Never spend money on the lottery that you can't afford to lose — odds are that you'll end up losing it. Below are just a few additional things to keep in mind when playing any lottery game:


No set of numbers is luckier than any other. The lottery is completely random. Any single set of numbers is just as likely to win as any other, no matter whether it's just come up or has never come up before in the history of the lottery. In other words, ""1,2,3,4,5,6"" is just as likely to win as six random numbers.
Your odds don't get better the longer you play. If you've been playing the lottery for a long time, you're not ""due"" to win. You're just as likely to win the next time you play as the very first time you played (which is to say, not very).
Remember that, in the United States, lottery jackpots are subject to a high amount of tax. For example, a $600 million Powerball jackpot, when taken as a lump sum, will net you about $377 million after taxes. Don't let outrageously high payout amounts trick you into spending lots of money on the lottery.

Use the singleton method.,
Buy the correct tickets.,
Chart the ""random"" outside numbers that repeat.,
Mark the ones.,
Look for groupings.,
Develop this technique.",How to Win on Lottery Tickets1," A few years ago, a statistician discovered a statistical quirk in the production of scratch-off tickets, which can double your chances of winning if exploited correctly.Basically, scratch off games operate under the assumption of ""randomness,"" but can't be produced in a truly random way, because the lottery board needs to keep track of how many winning tickets are in circulation.






;
, Some ""match style"" or ""tic-tac-toe"" scratch off tickets are marked with a kind of code you can learn to recognize. Look for the kind of ticket on which you must match ""3 in a row"" from a given group of amounts. Typically, the outside of the aluminum coating will be marked with seemingly ""random"" numbers you scratch off to reveal amounts on the inside. If, on a given ticket, game space, you get three $100 amounts, you win the amount listed.









These are the games that can be deciphered using the singleton method. They're also typically among the cheapest lottery tickets, and have the lowest payouts, so you can buy several to practice., Look at the numbers that mark the playing space and, for each, count how many times each number repeats on the ticket. Pay close attention to ""singletons."" These are the ""random"" numbers that appear only once on the ticket.









The digits you're looking for won't be the same--that would mean they would appear more than once. Remember, you're looking for numbers that appear only once.

, On a separate sheet of paper, draw a mock-up of the ticket, filling in ""1"" in place of the random digit in each space you find a singleton. A group of singletons will signal a winning card 60-90% of the time.








, Depending on the rules of the game you're playing, you might need to look for three in a given space, or three in a row, but typically cards that display this abnormality are statistically more likely to be winners.









60% may not sound like a lot, but the average scratch-off card has a 30% chance of winning, so you've doubled your chances. Over a large group of tickets, this can yield a significant profit.

, Experiment with other scratch off tickets looking for repetitions in the ""random"" numbers. All of them work on the same principle, and you might be able to discover an anomaly that you can exploit in a particular game. Buy cheap tickets and study them to see what you can come up with.

Practice with fake money first.",How to Win at Video Poker," There are dozens of different video-poker games in casinos. Different games will have different rate of returns, meaning some games, if you win, will give you a higher percentage of your money back and others will give you a lower percentage. A ""9/6 Jacks or Better"" paytable is the best because the rate of return is 99.54%, meaning the casino only keeps .46% of your money.You can find these tables by their names, or look at the pay for the full house and flush. The other categories pay similarly, but the full house and flush will pay more on a ""Jacks or Better"" game.
If you are unsure how to locate these games, you can visit a website where they have scouted out the best video poker games and their locations in a number of different casinos.When you find a payable that you like, you don't need to jump around to different tables. The odds will be the same on each table if they have the same pay table, so stick with the one you are on. If your pay table does not have a high rate or return, move around to different games until you find one with an acceptable rate of return.;
, Video poker is simple and similar to regular poker in that you are aiming for a hand that will give you the most return. To play video poker you will tap on the cards you wish to keep or on a button on the console, and then draw cards you wish to replace. You win by having a traditional poker hand, and the amount you win is determined by the machine you are playing on.


In video poker, just like regular poker, you will be given five cards. With those five cards you'll want to achieve a winning poker hand (royal flush, straight, full house, flush, four of a kind, three of a kind, two pair, jacks or better). To do this, you'll have the opportunity to keep certain cards in your hand and exchange others to gain new cards that may help you gain a winning poker hand.

, Each video poker machine gives you the option to insert five coins, and to best optimize your chances of winning more, you should play five coins, or max bet. On each play table you should see a chart that shows how many coins you will receive when winning a certain hand of poker. If you play five coins on a Jacks or Better table you can get 45 coins for a full house instead of nine coins. You also will receive a bonus for Royal Flush with a max bet.If you can't afford to play five coins at once, then switch to a lower-denomination machine. This means that the total amount for five coins is less -- a typical five coin game would be a dollar game, which you don't want to play a quarter at a time. A lower-denomination machine would be a quarter game, where you are playing a few cents at a time.

, On and around the screen of a video poker game you will see a few different things that are important to understand before playing a game.


Paytable: This is the table on the poker screen that shows you how much each hand in a poker game is worth. As previously stated, you'll want to choose a table that has the best paytable, meaning the highest payout for a win. Each paytable will show you how many coins you'll get in return for winning a hand from one coin played to up to five coins played.
Display area: Under the paytable is the display area, where you receive cards.
Credit total: This is under the card area and shows how many credits, based on the denomination of the machine, you have remaining.
Money insert/return slots: Cash-insert, voucher and club-card slots are positioned around the screen area of the machine. When you finish playing, the machine will return your balance in the form of a voucher. This slot is at the top left. Insert your player's club card in its slot before you start playing so you can earn reward points. Make sure that the card has been accepted.
Deal/draw button: On the right side of the keyboard is the deal-draw button. After each hand, hit the button to get the next hand dealt to you. After selecting the cards you want to hold, hit the button again to draw replacement cards. If you have a winning hand, the machine will add the appropriate number of credits to your balance.
Hold buttons: Directly below the screen are the hold buttons. After each new deal, press the buttons that correspond to the cards you wish to keep in your final hand.
Cash-out button: Press this button when you're done playing. The machine will provide a voucher with your balance.

, This is a vital component of extending your gambling dollar. Casinos will want you to come back if you're racking up rewards points. Many will provide cash back or give you coupons for meals. Some will comp your room for your entire stay.You can usually sign up for these clubs online or by visiting a club booth at the specific casino. Then, when you visit your casino make sure you bring your card and you can usually place them into a card reader slot. Depending on the casino you can rack up points for different things. For example, at one casino you may earn points for the hours you play, or the amount of money that you bet while playing. Then, a certain number of points will give you an amount of money. At one casino, 100 points may give you $1.00. As you gain more points you may be able to pay for things like meals.Usually casinos have different status levels for their player's clubs. The more you play the higher status you will achieve, which will eventually earn you more points and compensation for things like hotels.

, Some people will go into video poker without being familiar with the strategy behind the game. If you guess while playing, you may win money, but you'll have a better chance at winning the game if you understand the rules and components of the game.

, Different video poker games have different strategies, and it can be difficult to memorize all of the strategies. The best thing to do is pick a game you like and learn that strategy well.


If you get bored with that game or don't like it then move onto another game, but try to stick to one or two types of games instead of learning strategies for all the games. Trying to learn all of the games will make it difficult when playing one game because you may confuse some of the strategies.

, A strategy list is like a cheat sheet, that has all of the different ways you can win in a poker game in a list ranked from best hands to worse hands. Using a cheat sheet will help you determine which cards to keep and which cards to exchange for new cards. For example, if you have the opportunity to go for a straight with an outside straight, or you have the opportunity to go for three to four of a kind with a pair, a low pair is ranked higher on the list so that is what you should choose.


If you choose not to play 9/6 Jacks or Better, strategy cards for virtually every game are available online.
This strategy list is specifically for a 9/6 Jacks or Better game, which is one of the better games to play:

1. Full house or better
2. 4 to a royal flush (you have four cards and just need one more for a royal flush)
3. Straight, three of a kind, or flush
4. 4 to a straight flush (you have four cards and just need one more for a straight flush)
5. Two pair
6. High pair
7. 3 to a royal flush
8. 4 to a flush
9. Low pair
10. 4 to an outside straight (you have five--cards 6, 7, 8, 9, 2--and need one more on the outside--either a 5 or 10, to complete the straight)
11. 2 suited high cards (face cards)
12. 3 to a straight flush
13. 2 unsuited high cards (if more than 2 pick then pick lowest 2)
14. Suited 10/J, 10/Q, or 10/K
15. One high card
16. Discard everything



, When playing poker it is a good idea to have in mind the possibilities of winning. Some things to keep in mind when playing the game are:


The odds of hitting a royal flush are about 1 in 40,000.
A four of a kind happens about once an hour. The probability of getting a four of a kind is .24%
When you hold four cards and throw away one, there is a good chance you will receive a card with the same value.

, As well as understanding possibilities in a game of poker, it's good to keep in mind what your average loss during a session of video poker will be, so you go in with realistic expectations. To determine your average loss multiply the house end(the return the casino makes) by the bet size by the number of rounds per hour.In a 9/6 Jacks or Better game you would multiply .5% by $1.25 (this is a five coin, max bet game) by 400 (hands per hour). This would bring you to $2.50 an hour on a long term game. If you are playing a short term game, you are more likely to lose $6.50 an hour, because the house end for the casino will be higher (you'll have less chance of hitting the royal).
An average slot machine brings you to a loss of about $40 an hour, so playing video poker is a much better way to earn money with limited loss.

, Before you begin playing video poker with your own money, try practicing it on your computer with fake money so you can become familiar with the format of the game and better your chances of doing well at an actual casino. There are several websites you can visit to play video poker online to practice.Practicing online with fake money is the best way to familiarize yourself with the strategy for a specific game and give you practice in using the strategy sheet. It could be helpful to watch a few tutorials on video poker so you have a better grasp of how the game works.
There are also software programs available online that warn you when you're making a strategic error.

See how many numbers match.,
Know the benefits of the Mega Ball.,
Multiply your winnings with the Megaplier.",How to Check Mega Millions Numbers4," The first five numbers range from 1 to 75, and the last number is called the Mega Ball, which can be anywhere from 1 to 15. The Mega Ball can be the same number as the first five, but those numbers will be different. Your winnings are based on how many of your numbers are the same as the numbers listed each week. You win more for having more numbers matched, but you can still win smaller amounts by having just a couple matching numbers.

, This number is added to boost how much money players can win from their numbers. You could have four matching numbers and win only $500. However, if the Mega Ball matches correctly, then that prize is boosted to $5,000. In order to get a jackpot, you need to match all five numbers and have the correct Mega Ball. , Players have the option to purchase a Megaplier, which will randomly choose a number between 2 and 5. If you win a prize, then your winnings will be multiplied by this number, except for a jackpot. For example, if you won $50 and had a 3x Megaplier, then you would win $150. Note that the Megaplier is not available in all states, but it is available for purchase online."

Know what your position at the table means.,
Use your position to narrow the field.,
Let other players battle it out.,
Know when to fold based on your position.",How to Use Strategy to Win a Texas Hold’ Em Game1," In Texas Hold’em the dealer and/or the button-position will be passed to the next player toward the left after each hand. But, if one person deals all the time, then the button-position will rotate the table over time, otherwise the dealer job passes around. Understanding where you are in relation to the dealer/button will help you develop a strategy to win Texas Hold’em.The button has the strongest position because he/she will always wait to bet last on the current hand. The player who bets last will have the most information to work with as they’ve seen all other players bets/actions before making a move.
But, the player immediately to the right of the dealer, sometimes known as the “cutoff,” can potentially be in a strong position over the button as he has the ability to bet big enough to force the button into action/to bet-big or fold.
Players in early betting positions are the weakest as they have the least amount of information to go on. However, there is a bit of a balancing out for the first round if you are either the big or small blind, as you have a bet already on the table.;
, Narrowing the field means eliminating the other players for the hand. Some players will use a bet-big-early strategy to win Texas Hold’em, and while this may work, it also means you’re more likely to lose-big. Instead, try a strategy where you make smaller early bets to see some action before you try to over bet for other players to fold on the flop or turn (to tell them you drew something).


If you’re positioned at the top of the betting round you can make smaller bets (slow-play) and wait to see how other players react to the flop.
Regardless of where you are positioned, your hand will indicate how you should proceed. Pairs are often your option and the higher the pair the better off you are. Also look to see if your cards are of the same suit because suited cards give you a hopeful chance by allowing for drawing a flush.If you do have a good hand, you can make a larger bet to force other players out, especially if you have the position to wait to see how the other players bet. For example, if other players (act weak) aren’t betting very high, you can raise the pot and force some or all to fold.

, If you are in an earlier position you do have the benefit of being able to call the minimum and then waiting to see how other players handle the betting around the table. If a player bets big after you’ve called, you now know that he is either bluffing, or has a good hand. Chances are other players will make moves that indicate where the competition is going.


When you are later to act in a round of betting you are at a great advantage. This is helpful against predictable/tight players who you expect to ""tell"" you a lot by always checking weak hands and raising better hands. You can play marginal hands by betting when they check before you act. You can also re-raise players who bluff too often so that you don't believe they are betting good hands.

, Sometimes you just get a weak hand in an early position. This is a long game so sometimes your strategy for winning Texas Hold’em is folding-weak and waiting until you’re in a strong, later position.


If you’ve already bet but see other players raising the pot but you don’t have a good hand -- it might be best to fold your hand/not to call. This way when you’re in a better position in a later hand, you’ll still have those chips to work with.
Try not to fold before the flop unless a player is betting extremely large and you have a bad hand like a two and six. Even though this hand doesn’t look promising on its own it could create a straight, two pairs, three of a kind, or even a full house. But, if you’re in an early position and have to raise your bet to stay in with an unlikely winning hand, it might be best to fold.

Find the expected value.,
Determine the probability of each possible ""win."",
Multiple the probability by the payout for that win.,
Buy tickets that increase the expected value.,
Look for progressive jackpots.,
Consider the tax implications.",How to Win on Lottery Tickets2," This is a good idea for any lottery game you are considering playing. The expected value refers to the probability of any one outcome, assuming all outcomes are equally probable. Here, the expected value calculates the value of the ticket, if the game was set up fairly so that the revenue gained from the losing tickets would match the winners' profits.









In other words, this assumes the powerball lottery works like a fantasy football pool: five people throw in five bucks, the winner gets $25.

, This will depend upon the specific powerball or number game you're playing. If it's a six-digit number that you pick, there are nine possibilities for each position and six different positions. Since each outcome is equally likely, you'll need to calculate a permutation. Alternatively, the odds should be listed in the game's rules.







, The probability will be a very small number that you'll add together to determine the expected value. Doing this will result in a negative value. In general, for each $2 you invest in powerball tickets, you can expect $.93 back.









Account for any non-cash prizes by taking their cash value into account, and convert any annuities (annual distributions of prize money) into a lump sum for the purposes of this calculation.

, Specifically, a promotion that adds any percentage chance to the prize pool will make tickets a worthwhile purchase.









One example of this was the Missouri Lottery's promotion in the daily Pick 3. Normally a player has a 1/1000 chance of winning a $600 prize, making a $1 ticket worth only $0.60. The promotion was to draw a second winning combination on one randomly selected day of the week. Originally, the drawing to determine whether the bonus would occur that day held six white balls and one orange, but on the last day of the week, all six white balls had been removed, leaving only the orange ball and ensuring a double drawing on the last day. This doubled the value of tickets for that drawing and converted them from an expected 40 percent loss to a 20 percent gain. See table 1 below for how the expected value varied that week.

, Larger jackpots increase the payouts and therefore the value of a ticket. The value of a large progressive jackpot is very sensitive to the exact rules of the game, so be sure to understand them.









The Massachusetts lottery imposed purchase limits after it was discovered that their Cash Win-fail game had a positive expected value after a jackpot was rolled down to increase the payouts for lower level prizes.In the Mega Millions multi-state lottery, jackpots are split equally among all winners who match all numbers. If a player could ensure that he wouldn't have to split the jackpot, Mega Millions becomes a smart bet whenever the jackpot exceeds about $420 million, but this calculation doesn't account for the possibility of a split jackpot. It has been theorized that the ticket buying frenzies as the jackpot rises increases the likelihood of multiple winners sufficiently that the jackpot can never get large enough to give a ticket a positive expected value., In the United States, gambling winnings are taxable, but gambling losses are only deductible to offset winnings. This legal asymmetry may affect the math. The double draw promotion that resulted in a 20 percent player advantage before tax considerations is only profitable after taxes, provided the player can purchase the hundreds of tickets required to cover a significant fraction of the 1000 outcomes."

Read the table and the players.,
Look for tells.,
Play the player.,
Slow-play especially on your monster hands.,
Intimidate as a big part of your strategies.,
Get into the mind of your immediate opponent, heated to distraction.,
Bluff.",How to Use Strategy to Win a Texas Hold’ Em Game2," Reads are a very important part of poker. Practice putting your opponent on hands, meaning making educated guesses as to what his cards are, and profiling what type of player he is based on the hands he plays and how he plays them.With enough practice you’ll soon see that you can narrow your opponent's hand down to a few possibilities.


This involves paying attention to players’ tendencies. Note which players like to bet big, who plays a tight game, etc.

, Everyone, even the best poker players in the world will have a tell. Some players are just much better at disguising them. This doesn’t exactly mean seeing if a player itches his nose every time he has a good hand. It’s more about finding a pattern in a player’s betting and folding habits. After all, any strategy to win Texas Hold’em involves playing all the cards, not just your own.


Pay attention to see if a player folds early when he has a bad hand. If he is suddenly betting in several rounds then chances are he has a good hand.
Take note on the size of bets and look for patterns. If a player usually just calls or makes the minimum bet and is suddenly acting out of character that could be a tell.
More obvious tells are head scratching, sighing, and even how the player is sitting. A relaxed player might have a good hand while a player with a bad hand might be slumping. Read body language to inform you.

, If your opponent is a tight player, meaning he’s careful with his bets, you can loosen up and play weaker starting hands like K-J unsuited, “bad aces” like A-3, or or a lower pair. If he comes at you with a raise, you might be beat and should throw away marginal hands.


Perhaps you’re up against a player who is looser with his bets. You can play him against himself by baiting him into raising his bets. If you have a good hand and you know your opponent likes to bet, then go ahead and see if you can draw him out. Just be mindful that he might have a good hand as well.

, If you flop a monster/""the nuts"" (the best possible flop with your hold cards) or at least trips, just check and call any bets to induce a bluff since you seem weak, or on the bad side, you may let your opponents catch a card on the turn or river. Slow-playing works best with loose aggressive players that you hope will try to bluff when no one has bet/as if they have nothing. If you flop a full house and bet out, everyone folds and you only win a small pot. So just check and let others lead out, as you try to catch a card on 4th or 5th street. Be careful, though, that you don't slow-play and get many opponents checking to see draws. For example, if you hold T(♥) - T(♠), and the flop comes T(♣) - 9(♦) - 3(♣) for ""trips T's"", and you now have three or more opponents in the pot. Do not slow play your set/trips, especially if you raised pre-flop and are known to make continuation bets. Bet ""a third of the pot"" to make the flush draws and straight draws fold or pay to see the next card.

, Win by intimidation -- not Most Popular. Psyche (tilt) the other players, within the rules of a tournament. Keep quizzing earlier position players face up and theorizing about their hand while betting against them, without violating rules. Bragging about hitting the nuts, coconuts, monkey nuts is silly but boggles their minds. Over-talk, over-analyze how you might bet; say how they may be ""strategizing"", about what they hold: ""So, do you think you are ahead. Do you? So what do you have, like something good. Oh, so is it suited? Are they connectors? Well, suited connectors, no? So, you have small pair, or do you?"" -- while watching the reactions of each of the betters who are in the pot ahead of you.


Remark without delaying play when one loses to you on a showdown, ""How could you bet on Jack, ten?"" and stuff like, ""Why would you waste your time and money on Queen-high, awe, oh man..."" Don't expect answers, but don't interfere with actual play. Ask about any sort of legitimate issue. Ask about every aspect of their game only as you face each person, on each and every round, as you are apparently deciding how much to bet or whether to fold. Especially against shorter stacks, ask never-ending but seemingly sensible questions while you decide. ""You want me to bet? Or, do you want me to fold?"" so then ""If you want we to bet, I might have to fold. Honestly, what do you want -- me to do, fold? Yeah, fold? Fold right..."" Then if your opponent folds with a much better hand than you -- you only show your low card. Steam will come out of the folder's ears. You put your opponent on tilt.
Take ""forever"" to fold, being careful, then say, ""I think you got the nuts, right? So, you have queen or better, okay, I fold."" If that feels right, and you are not already all-in... ""Every time you play your hand the way you would, if you could see your opponents' cards, you gain, and every time your opponents play their cards differently from the way they would play them, if they could see your cards, you gain."" , per David Sklansky author, considered an expert on gambling. Which is like ""Play to 'what the opponent most likely holds from their time/position/size of bet and based on past pattern of play,' and get the other to play to 'whatever you suggest that you have and know what they have by your chatter and leading questions while you were deciding how to bet.' "" -- then the opponent quite often folds the better hand because you've put so many confusing/spinning thoughts in his/her mind (tilt!).

, Don't expect many answers. Ask for various counts: ""So, how much is your stack?"" ""I may just put you all in!"" ""I'll show you my hand at the end, okay."", then quickly say ""if you show me yours, I'll show you mine""... ""Do want me to count my stack; well, (taking some time) I have about ___."" Be serious, ""I need to know ____"" asking ""how much is in the pot?"", ""how much is the current bet"""", etc. -- anything theoretically worth knowing. As if you don't know. ""Hey, so you have a bottom pair. No, it's top pair."" ""Now, I think you're on a queen... Yeah, yeah, you do have a face card. You do, right?"" You can say such guesses, and ask about your guess, about their hold; now, change your mind; guess again, etc. Get the table hot, angry or exasperated, so they may over-bet on weak hands to try to get back at you. But they end up folding or losing hands, stuttering, muttering and confused.


Tone it down to be less hated. Don't talk while they are deciding what to bet or to fold. Be, ""Mr. Nice Guy"" in words. Say, ""Nice hand!"" even if you win it. Say, ""good play, nice round"", but not letting up on the quiz.

, Bluffing is an art learned over time. If you are new to bluffing, then try doing it on smaller bets that won’t impact you too much if you lose. Focus on staying consistent with your actions, and try not to let your voice or face give you away.


Betting with a hand that is not out rightly a probable winner is a good way to get used to bluffing. If you have an decent hand but you think the odds are good that it may improve with more cards coming down the river, this can be a great way to practice bluffing and end up being a very profitable play.
You basically have two ways to win through a bluff. Your opponents think that they can’t beat you based on your bets and fold right away, or you keep bluffing in the hopes that you can make the best hand (usually flush or straight). This tactic works best in later position if everyone checks to you.

Play fewer hands.,
Get rid of small pockets as soon as they don’t serve you.,
Play the pot odds.,
Be assertive when the odds are in your favor.",How to Use Strategy to Win a Texas Hold’ Em Game3," As long as you have chips on the table you’re in the game. Playing fewer hands is a strategy to win Hold’em that involves you waiting for the right cards.


In Hold’em, there are a 169 combinations of hands of you can be dealt, not including hands of the same suit. suits.Only five of those hands are premium hands that will give you the best chance at winning.

AA
KK
QQ
JJ
AK - if they’re the same suit.


There are fifteen hands that are considered top hands including the five above. Other combos include the Ace and face cards, along with high numbered pairs like two (2) tens.
That means that you should focus on playing hands that are most likely going to reward you instead of trying to constantly bluff or out bet other players with a weaker hand.

, This doesn’t mean immediately folding if you get dealt one of these hands, especially if you’re either big or small blind and have already bet.


Hands like 2-2 ,5-5 or 7-7 lose most of their value after the flop unless you make a set (three of a kind) so it’s better not to hold out for something down the river and just cut your losses.
You don’t always have to fold on a small pocket as they could lead to a winning hand, but don’t let yourself get carried away just because you start with a pair.

, If there is a large pot, say $100 and your opponent has raised another $100 then it’s usually a mistake to chase the pot hoping that you can end up with something like a flush or straight. This strategy typically has you losing more than winning.


Don’t always chase straight and flush draws even though it’s tempting. A skilled opponent won’t let you see the next card without first paying up unless he’s confident he has your draw beat and is trying to win the pot as quickly as possible.
While making large bets is a tactic to forcing other players to fold, sometimes a bet that’s very large can be an indication that your opponent has the winning hand.

, Remember that these strategies for winning Texas Hold’em rely largely on you being patient and taking in as many small or medium pots as you can instead of a couple larger ones. If you’ve employed the other strategies here and have waited for quality hands, you can use what you know to beat your opponents.


For example. The odds of getting two cards that you need on the turn or the river is less than 1%. So as soon as you have a hand you’re confident you can win with, bet like you’re going to win.
Raise before the flop and if you hit your hand keep betting, but don’t overdo it, one pair won’t often win big pots, but a high pair can lead to a solid win if you can force other players out quickly. When you play aggressively, you can put your opponents onto the defensive and can force them out making it less likely for someone to make a better hand than you.

Don't look at their eyes.,
Look for intimidation.,
Watch their shoulders.,
Observe their breathing.",How to Tell if Someone Is Lying in Poker1," The common advice is to look someone in the eye to see if they are lying. This is not a tested strategy, however. Skilled players have no problems looking someone in the eye while bluffing.A new or unskilled player might glance away or dilate their pupils some when bluffing, but these are often stress responses. When a player learns to control the stress that comes with bluffing, these signals become easy to control.;
, When a player is trying to bluff you, their natural instinct is to try to look intimidating to encourage you to fold your hand away. Intimidation tactics may include slamming down chips, talking loud, and staring you down.


Staring at you directly in the eyes is often an indicator of a bluff. While there are a number of reasons another play may look you directly in the eyes, someone holding eye contact is often trying to keep focus on them and intimidate you., Stress causes our shoulders to tense up. If you are observant, you may be able to see some of your opponents slightly crunch their shoulders upward and inward. If you see this, it usually means your opponent is scared or has a weak hand.One the other hand, when your opponent drops their shoulders, it usually means they missed their hand. An opponent in this situation will likely not bluff and is no longer a threat to you during that hand.

, When an opponent starts breathing heavily in a deep up and down motion, that is a good sign that something is deeply stressing them out. If your opponent has just made a huge bet and their breathing becomes deeper, chances are they are bluffing.Hyperventilation may also indicate a stressful situation. Shallow breaths and frequent inhalation may indicate that your opponent does not know what to do next or is nervous during a hand.

The dealer should assert control and perform the split himself.,
Color up the chips into stacks of each denomination.,
Take the highest denomination stack of chips and divide it into a stack for each of the winners.

,
If a winner stack is unequal, use the next highest denomination chip to even out the short stack values.

,
Repeat these steps for each of the stacks, proceeding from highest value to lowest value until indivisible chips remain.

,
Break the indivisible chips into the lowest denomination chip that is currently in play.,
Starting with the winner stack closest to the dealer's left, distribute one of each of the remainder to each stack until none are left.",How to Split a Pot in Poker," Tell the other players hands off while you begin dividing the chips.;
, Once you have completed the coloring up, move on to the next step.

,,,,


For example, if the lowest chip in play is $100, a left-over $500 chip should be broken into five $100 chips.

,


After breaking down to five $100 chips as above, if there were three winners, the two closest to the left of the dealer would receive two $100 chips and the third would receive a single $100 chip.
If $25 was the smallest chip in play, the $500 chip would be broken into twenty $25 chips (or just as easily three $100 and eight $25) and divided $175/$175/$150 from left to right.

Learn and play Texas hold' em.,Do a simulation with aces because many beginners play any ace.,
This simulation is useful because hold' em is played high and not high/low, there are no wild cards, the ace is the highest card.,
Initially use a deck of cards to do simulations.,
Use a deck of cards to recognize ratios (odds) in later studies.,
For the first simulation, do a statistical study of the distribution of aces in a game for 8 players.,
Think of all possible outcomes of a simulation before starting.,
List the outcomes in the order, that you think, the results will be from large to small.,

After shuffling, dealing out, and recording the results of a couple hundred deals, stop.,
Make a summary of the simulation results.,
After spending hours doing simulations, think about the essence of what you are doing and how you could do it faster.,

Start using an online random number integer generator to do this simulation.,
Later, do this simulation for 6, 4, and 2 players.,
After much thought and study on this method and randomness, improve your way of using data from the random number generator.,Look beyond the name of a game, and use the games that comes with Windows like hearts to take statistics.",How to Use an Online Random Number Generator to Do Poker Simulations," For real money, play on the lowest limit. When using play money, remember that in a real game, a rake of about five percent is taken from each pot. # After playing the game, do simulations, to improve your game. There many ways to improve your game, simulations can be done for free online or with a deck of cards.
,, The results of this simulation can be applied to other cards like kings or queens, because there are four kings and queens., Although this is a slow way to do simulations, many old-time players used this method., Cards are superior to poker software for this., There are many distributions of aces studies that can be done, so choose one that you think will be useful. For example, if you normally play in a game with about 8 players, choose 8 players as your first study. In this example, you have an ace and another card as your hole cards and the flop has an ace, tabulate what the other 7 players at the table have in term of aces., In this example the outcomes are:

No one has an ace,
One person has an ace,
Two people have an ace, and
On person has 2 aces.

, By doing this, not only will you have good use of your paper, but you will realize that the results will be different from what you thought they would be. From the results, you will have an advantage over players who only play and guess., Add the totals and assign percentages to the outcomes. Repeat this for 6 players, because very often the number of players in an eight player game fluctuates., For this simulation, a conclusion is that your kicker is important since there is a 52% chance that a player(s) has an ace(s). This is mostly true, since poker is a complex game, the outcome depends on other factors as position, how many players are left in the hand, split pot rules etc. A broader conclusion is that you should do many more simulations, The essence is that you are concerned with either aces or non-aces. In a deck of cards there are 4 aces and 48 non-aces., Assign the numbers from 1 and 4 as aces and 5 to 52 as non-aces. Already accounted for are: 2 aces and 3 non-aces. Set the random number generator to produce numbers, from 3 to 49, in separate groups of 14, since you want to see the 2 hole cards of the other seven players. The first and second numbers are the hole cards of player 1, the third and fourth numbers are the hole cards of player 2, the fifth and sixth cards are the hole cards or player 3, etc. This is faster than using cards. There are other creative ways to use a random number generator., Do simulations for other distributions like straights, flushes, pocket pairs, pre flop, fourth street etc., Buy a good poker software, one that you can create conditions like from Wilson Software. Learn how to write programs to do these simulations.,"

Understand that each bet and each card that comes up on the board is a piece of information.,
Evaluate the flop.,
Evaluate your pocket hand.,
Evaluate the turn and the river.,
Gather information about the other players' hands.,
Slow-play especially on your monster hands.,
Intimidate as a big part of your strategies.,
Get into the mind of your immediate opponent, heated to distraction.,
Know when to bluff.,
Know when to slow-play (conservative approach).",How to Strategize in Texas Holdem," You must learn which pieces of information are useful and which ones are useless.;
, As far as your hand is concerned, the flop is the most valuable piece of information you will get. This is hinted at with the phrases, ""I'll pay to see the flop"" or ""that was a cheap flop.""

, Your pocket hand is the second most useful piece of information you get and best of all, unless you are in the blind, it is free. You could say that on average it costs one-seventh of a bet in a ten-handed game. Regardless of what the odds dictate, it's a good choice to pay one-seventh to see the two-sevenths of your hand. On the other hand, the flop is quite expensive relative to the cost of your pocket hand. The math says that it is best to play your pocket cards very tight because of the relative cost per card of seeing the flop.


Imagine you are playing a parlor game that involves seven boxes containing between $0 and $5. You only get to keep the money if you have all seven boxes in front of you. You get two boxes for free and you open them up. You got two $1 bills. The man will let you see three more boxes for $8. This may seem like a good deal because the average box contains $2.50 and you already have $2, but why would you pay $8 to see three more boxes when you can just play the game again and again until your first two boxes contain $8, $9 or $10?
This concept is even stronger in poker because there are more risk factors involved--for example, straights often lose to flushes, two pairs often lose to trips, and sometimes even if you have a full house the board will create a better one for the guy who you thought you had beat.

, It is often said that if you don't have a hand by the flop, you need to get out. In information theory, this could not be more true. You will probably pay substantially more for each of the final cards than you just paid to see the three previous cards. Again, the math says that paying just to see a turn or a river card is a sucker bet. Your money is much better spent paying for blinds and flops. You will be better off putting your money in a slot machine. Yes, people have beaten you on the turn and river cards, but that's the tagline. Remember that Texas Holdem was once a kind of parlor game that hucksters used to swindle draw and stud poker players. Don't get swindled.

, There is one piece of information that is always 100% accurate. The more people see the flop, the better the winning hand will be. It may seem illogical from a pot odds perspective, but think of it this way, the more people call the blind, the less of an informational edge you will have.


You get information on how good players' hands are from their bets. Be very cautious before assuming what another player has. You have to be one step ahead of your opponents and here's how: if a good player bets high with very little information on the table, he probably has a good hand.

, If you flop a monster/""the nuts"" (the best possible flop with your hold cards) or at least trips, just check and call any bets to induce a bluff since you seem weak, or on the bad side, you may let your opponents catch a card on the turn or river. Slow-playing works best with loose aggressive players that you hope will try to bluff when no one has bet/as if they have nothing. If you flop a full house and bet out, everyone folds and you only win a small pot. So just check and let others lead out, as you try to catch a card on 4th or 5th street. Be careful, though, that you don't slow-play and get many opponents checking to see draws. For example, if you hold T(♥) - T(♠), and the flop comes T(♣) - 9(♦) - 3(♣) for ""trips T's"", and you now have three or more opponents in the pot. Do not slow play your set/trips, especially if you raised pre-flop and are known to make continuation bets. Bet ""a third of the pot"" to make the flush draws and straight draws fold or pay to see the next card., Win by intimidation -- not Most Popular. Psyche (tilt) the other players, within the rules of a tournament. Keep quizzing earlier position players face up and theorizing about their hand while betting against them, without violating rules. Bragging about hitting the nuts, coconuts, monkey nuts is silly but boggles their minds.

, A bluff coming from early position is an all-around bad move. You should only bluff when you expect to get a return on your money in the long run (with some exceptions - see Tips). Based only on the cards and bets, you don't know what you are up against. Your raise may look intimidating, but only the tightest of players will throw away a pocket pair or two high cards in the face of an early position raise. Anyone who routinely bluffs from early position will lose in the long run.


Similarly, bluffing and semi-bluffing from late position is a more appropriate strategy as it will confuse the early position player... if you have been playing well on a regular basis.

, You typically slow-play to hide the value of your hand. There is no point to slow-playing if you are in late position. Your hand's value is already obscured by the fact that you have position. People are already unsure of how good your hand is, so why let them see another card that might save them.


Slow-playing from early position is a good move. An early position call on the flop followed by a check on the flop completely disguises your hand.

Take note of their betting patterns.,
Monitor their speaking patterns.,
Shaking hands.",How to Tell if Someone Is Lying in Poker2," One of the biggest indicators your opponent is bluffing is how your opponent bets. An opponent who normally raises pre-flop to five multiples of the blinds suddenly and makes it 2x the blind instead. This is a major tell that they want you to call. If they make it 10x the blind, they wants you to fold.Take note of how aggressive your opponent bets when they have a good hand. If they are generally a more aggressive better overall, there’s a chance that they will try to intimidate you out of your hand with strong betting patterns.

, When a quiet person at the game suddenly starts talking, it's time to pay attention. Introverted people often talk less because social interaction may stress them out. This means that if a quiet opponent is talking, they are likely relaxed.A relaxed opponent is likely not bluffing and may even have a strong hand.
On the other hand, if a more social player suddenly gets quiet, they may be devoting most of their attention to their hand. Chances are that they have something good and need to think about how to play it.

, This is a tell for a player holding a major hand. Often, players nervous enough to shake know that they are not in any condition to bluff. It would be too noticeable. Instead, this tell typically indicates newer players who have trouble holding in their emotions. Expect aces, sets, or other huge hands when someone bets with shaking hands.When you see shaking stop, that is a potential tell that your opponent is bluffing. This may be seen right after your opponent bets against you. Look for any signs that they are trying to control themselves.
For people who shake or bob their legs unconsciously, a bluff may cause them to stop their movement in an attempt to control themselves and make it appear as though they have no tells.

"
"
Look for a passive player.,
See if they are reluctant to bet.,
Look around their eyes.",How to Tell if Someone Is Lying in Poker3," When someone has a good hand, they tend to try to look as calm and passive as possible. This may come naturally due to lack of stress to bluff, or a player may try to put on a show to demonstrate their feigned lack of interest in their hand.Some intentionally passive gestures may include big sighs, slumping in their chairs, saying things like ""I guess I'll bet."" or shaking their head.
Often, if a player is making a point to show lack of interest in their hand, it is because they have something they want you to be into.

, A player who bets conservatively or seems unhappy to have to bet is likely holding a strong hand. In order to make their hand seem weaker, they will try to seem unsure about whether they should bet.This is a particularly good tell for someone who is generally an aggressive better. A sudden change to a more reserved betting pattern likely indicates a strong hand.

, While stress indicators in the eyes are easy for an experienced player to control, smiling from the eyes often is not. An experienced player knows better than to smile when they get a good hand, but their eyes will often narrow somewhat. The best indicator of this is seeing crows feet suddenly appear around their eyes.Even if your opponent has their eyes covered, watch how the skin folds in the area around their eyes. The sudden emergence of fine lines may indicate that they are sincerely excited for their hand.

Play according to your position.,
Get a feel for the other players at the table.,
If everyone is folding when you get a big hand, you will need to mix up your game.,

Instead of becoming desperate, steal some pots.,
Pay attention to the player stack amounts.,
The $5 and $50 Sit n go's are much different.,
If you're going to play in the $50 Sit and Go's make sure your game is sharp.,
Some players find the higher stakes games to be easier than the lower stakes ones because the players are more predictable.

,Play tight against loose players and loose against tight players

",How to Win a Sit N Go Poker Tournament," You should play tighter (play fewer but stronger hands) in early position. In late position you can loosen up and play more hands, because you are last to act. Seeing what the other players have done gives you an advantage. And you'll keep this advantage in later betting rounds.;
, Watch the cards the other players play. Weak tight players will give away chips in the face of raises. Aggressive players will force you to make hard decisions, so stick to premium starting hands against them.

, Change your style and limp (just call the bet) in. Or show a bluff once in a while to confuse your opponents.

, Players tighten up on the bubble, so be aggressive and steal some of the blinds.

, Especially if everyone is folding to you. Stolen pots will build momentum and carry you into the money finishes.

, If there is a player who is short stacked, expect 2 things. First they will go all-in when they have ACE anything or 2 high cards. Second there will be good chance they will be taken out shortly. So play accordingly. Don't take chances against the big stack while there is a short stack soon to be blinded out.

, Beginners usually play the smaller buy-in tournaments. More experienced players will play the bigger buy-in tournaments. Be careful not to blow your bankroll when you move up to the higher stakes.

Start out with six chips.,

Guide the chips with your middle finger.,
Split the stack and do everything again.,
Look at the chip pattern for clues.,
Experiment with finger placement.,
Ask someone to watch or record your shuffle.,
Add more chips.,
Practice with the maximum number of chips you can handle.,
Try adding a third stack.",How to Shuffle Poker Chips," Shuffling is easier with a smaller number of chips, and six is the minimum amount needed.It will be helpful if you pick three chips of one color and three chips of another.


If you don't own any poker chips, you can practice with six coins of equal size instead. While the shuffling method will be the same, coins are a little more difficult to work with.;
, Separate the chips by color. The different colors will help you to distinguish between the two different stacks. If you shuffle correctly, you will end with one stack of alternating colors.

, Position them parallel to you. Shuffling will be easier to do on a soft surface. Consider practicing on a bed, pillow, couch, or some felt at first. As your shuffling skills improve, you can switch to a hard surface., Your hand should be roughly parallel with the flat surface, while your fingers should point face down, touching it at their tips. Your thumb and index finger should be up against opposite sides of one stack with your thumb closer to your body. Your pinky and ring fingers should be up against the other stack. Place your middle finger between the two stacks at the side further from your body., Apply slight pressure to the two stacks with your thumb, index finger, ring finger, and pinky. Hook your middle finger so that its tip is slightly under the two stacks at the center. Pull up with your middle finger and then let the two stacks fall back down. Squeeze your fingers while doing this so that the stacks come together., Run your middle finger along the two stacks as they fall back down. Use your middle finger to control how the chips fall, alternating the two stacks perfectly. Once they have been laced together, complete the shuffle by squeezing your hand completely, creating a single stack with six chips., Lift the top three chips off of the tall stack between your thumb and middle finger. Place these chips next to the bottom three, creating two stacks of three like you started with. Shuffle again, split, and repeat until you are able to do everything in one fluid motion.

, One reason why it's a good idea to practice with different colored chips is that it makes it easier to tell when something is going wrong with your shuffle. When done properly, your shuffled chips should alternate between the two colors. If you see two or more of the same color next to each other in the stack, you should reevaluate your technique. If there is a general lack of interlacing, you can try working on couple aspects of your shuffle:


Make sure you aren't shoving the two stacks together. You should only exert a minimal amount of force when pushing from the sides while the chips are falling.
You may not be lifting the two columns correctly. The bottom chips should form 45 degree angles with the table.A slightly wider angle will also work, but a more acute one will not give the chips room enough to fall.

, While the standard shuffle grip works for both right- and left-handed people, it may not work best for everyone.You can place your fingers however you like, as long as the position fulfills two major requirements: You must have at least one digit on the far outside edge of each stack so that they can be pushed together. Additionally, one digit must be able to hook underneath where the two stacks meet.


It's normal to experience some discomfort in your hand when you first start to shuffle since you may be using muscles in ways you're not used to.However, if you continue to feel uncomfortable after practicing, consider modifying your finger placement.

, When you're shuffling poker chips, it can be difficult to see what's going on since your hand will be blocking your view. Someone else closely watching you shuffle can help you figure out the exact step you're having trouble with.


Even better, ask him or her to make a close-up video of you shuffling. Watch the video for yourself in slow motion, paying close attention to the position of the chips and your hand motions. Observing your actions from the outside can give you a better perspective.

, Once you can confidently shuffle six poker chips, add two more chips and practice shuffling eight together. Once you get comfortable with eight, try ten. Keep adding chips in increments of two.The only limiting factor to the number of chips you can shuffle will be the size of your hands.

, Shuffling a large stack of chips is more difficult than working with a small one. However, you will use the same muscles and movements shuffling both. By practicing with a larger number of chips, you will be sure to shuffle a slightly smaller number with ease during an actual game.

, Shuffling three stacks is fundamentally similar to shuffling two stacks but is much more difficult to accomplish. Even people with a lot of poker chip trick experience have difficulty with the triple stack shuffle. If you'd like to give it a try, the method itself is deceptively simple:


Make a triangle out of three equal stacks of at least three chips.
Press the fingers of your dominant hand vertically against the three stacks. Your thumb will hold one stack, your index and middle fingers a second, and your ring finger and pinky the final third.
Push the three stacks into each other.
While pushing, lift your hand up.
While pushing and lifting your hand, try to tilt all three stacks upwards at the center of the triangle.
Squeeze the three stacks together with your fingers."

Use a strategy to play video poker.,
Press “deal” to start gambling.,
Keep pairs when you see them.,
Increase your chances of getting high winning combinations.",How to Play Video Poker2," Each kind of poker has a winning strategy associated with it. By following these guidelines, you increase your chances of winning. The most popular poker game, “Jacks or Better,” has an easy-to-follow game strategy and a large variety of winning combinations.Different poker games require different strategies. If you choose to play a game such as “Deuces Wild” or “Joker Poker,” learn those strategies before playing.

, If you’re playing “Jacks or Better” the machine will deal you five cards from a deck of 52 cards. However, other kinds of poker games such as “Deuces Wild” and “Joker Poker” have jokers in the deck.This could lower your chances of getting the cards you want. Therefore, most people prefer to play “Jacks or Better.”

, Unless you have a high winning combination, choose combinations that are simple: a pair, two pairs, or three of a kind. These hands have smaller payouts but a higher chance of occuring.The payouts for pairs and three of a kinds will be listed on the payout table.


A pair refers to two cards that have the same numerical value, regardless of suit. A low pair can easily convert to a full house or three of a kind if you hold them. Similarly, the term “three of a kind” refers to three cards that have the same numerical value, regardless of suit. This hand will usually pay out slightly more than a pair would.

, If you don’t have any pairs, keep any high face cards to increase your chances of getting a royal flush. If you don’t have any high cards or any pairs, discard your entire hand. Your second deal may give you pairs or a straight.Know when to discard cards. Don’t hang on to high cards over pairs. Getting a lot of pairs will help you break even as you gamble.

Keep an eye out for cards that may form a Straight.,
Try to get a Flush.,
Look for a Full House.,
Try to get a Straight Flush.,
Keep an eye out for a Royal Flush.",How to Play Video Poker3," These combinations include pairs, three of a kind, and four of a kind. These hands have cards that are the same numerical rank. To get these hands, hold two or three cards that are in the same rank. The more matching cards you have, the higher your payout will be.


Don’t hold an unpaired card in the hope that you’ll get a pair on the second deal. The chances of you getting the exact card you would need are slim.

, A Straight consists of four cards in numerical sequence, regardless of suit. You have the best chance of getting this hand if you’re dealt three cards in sequence on the first deal. However, only attempt to get an outside card, not an inside card. An inside card would complete the Straight by filling an inside spot. For example, if you had a 3, 4, and 6, you would be looking for an inside card. The chances of getting this card are low.
An outside card would complete the Straight by filling an outside spot. For example, if you have a 4, 5, and 6, you could get a 3 or a 7 to complete the straight.

, A Flush occurs when you have five cards in the same suit. These cards can have any numerical value. You have the best chance of getting this hand if you’re dealt four cards of the same suit on the first deal. Hold these cards and hope for the fifth card of the ​same suit.

, A Full House has three cards of same numerical rank and two cards of a different but matching numerical rank. If you have two pairs on the first deal, hold these and try to get a Full House. Similarly, if you have three of a kind on the first deal, hold these for an even better chance to get a Full House.


For example, if you had three jacks, hold these for a chance to get another pair and make a Full House.

, A Straight Flush has five cards in numerical order from the same suit. This excludes a straight using of all the face cards (a Royal Flush.) If you have three or more cards in the same suit and in numerical sequence, hold them to try to get a straight flush.It’s easier to get an “outside” card than an “inside” card. For example, if you had a 3, 4, and 5, of hearts, you could get a 2 or 6 of hearts. If you had a 3, 4, and 6 of hearts, you would HAVE to get a 5 of hearts.

, A Royal Flush happens when you have a ten, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace in the same suit. This is the highest payout hand in the game. Your chances of getting this hand are best if you get three or more relevant cards in the first deal.For example, if you’re dealt a two of hearts, a three of diamonds, and a ten, jack, and king of hearts, hold the last three cards to try to get a Royal Flush.

, Before any cards are dealt, each player decides on an Ante bet, or whether their hand will be better than the dealer's.


If you're at a casino, place the amount of poker chips you wish to bet on the space labeled Ante.
At home, you'll need a way to designate each player's Ante, Play, and Pair Plus® bets without getting them confused.
Some casinos require that each player places an Ante bet, while others allow the player to bet solely on Pair Plus® (see below).
Casinos often have a ""table minimum"", requiring each bet to be at least the posted amount.

, In addition to the Ante bet, you can optionally place a Pair Plus® bet, which gives payoffs according to the quality of your hand.This also occurs before cards are dealt.
This bet is named ""pair plus"" due to its payout on any hand with at least a pair or better.

, The deck of cards is shuffled and dealt out face down.


Each player looks at his own hand. There is no need for the dealer to do so.

, Now that you've seen the quality of your 3-card hand, you decide whether to Play (or Raise) your Ante bet, or whether to Fold:


In order to have the Ante bet stand, you must place an equal amount of money on the space designated Play.
If you decide to Fold instead, the dealer takes your Ante bet and you cannot win that wager.
In some casinos, folding will forfeit your Pair Plus® bet as well, if you made one., Once all players who made an Ante bet have Played or Folded, all hands are turned face up.


If a player Folded and did not place a Pair Plus® bet, the dealer usually takes his cards before hands are turned face up, since that player has no wager left standing.

, Any player who Played (Raised) their Ante bet compares his hand to the dealer and has a chance to win a payout according to the casino rules. If playing at home, use the following typical rules:If the dealer's hand is High Card Jack or lower (""Jack High""), the dealer pays each player equal to that player's Ante bet (""even money"") and returns each player's Ante and Play bets.
If the dealer's hand is High Card Queen or better (""Queen High""), but worse than a player's hand, the dealer pays that player an amount equal to the player's Ante and Play bets combined and returns those bets.
If the dealer has Queen High or a better hand, and exactly equal to a player's hand, the dealer returns that player's Ante and Play bets but pays no money.
If the dealer has Queen High or better and beats a player's hand, the dealer keeps that player's Ante and Play bets.

, Separate from the Ante Payout, each player who made a Pair Plus bet gets a reward based on their hand quality. The dealer's hand does not matter for this prize. If playing at home, use the following popular payout system(a 3:1 reward means the player wins 3 times their pair plus bet):

In theory, this benefits each player equally, though players with a greater knowledge of card hierarchy will often be able to benefit more from a greater number of cards.


The most common numbers of cards called are 5-card and 7-card stud poker, but some tables might play with 3 cards or other numbers of cards.;
, Another complexity that is part of many stud poker games is wild cards. A wild card is a card that can be used to represent any number and any suit. Most often, the dealer of the hand is given the right to call wild cards before dealing. Any cards can be wild, though it's not normal to call more than 4 wild cards in a hand, since it can make the game much more chaotic.

, You need between two and eight players to play Stud Poker. Any number in between two and eight will work, but you definitely can’t play alone. Grab some friends and get started.

, There are ten potential hands, or combinations of cards, in Stud Poker. The best hand is the royal flush, then the straight flush, then four of a kind, then the full house, then a flush, then a three of a kind, then two pair, then one pair, then high card.A flush is any five cards of the same suit. They don’t need to be consecutive.
A straight is five consecutive cards. They don’t need to be the same suit. For example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 would be a straight
A straight flush is a straight where all five cards have the same suit.
A royal flush is 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King with each card sharing the same suit.
A straight flush is a straight where all five cards have the same suit.
A four of a kind is any four of the same number.
A three of a kind is three of the same number.
A one pair is any two of the same number.
A two pair is any two one pairs.
A full house is a three of a kind and a one pair.
A high card is if you have none of the other combinations. Then your highest card is automatically your hand. Ace is the highest card, two is the lowest card.

, Everyone at your table needs some chips. Each player will use their chips to bet during the course of the game. Once everyone has chips, everyone needs to ‘ante up’. This means that everyone puts one chip into the pot before the hand begins. You can decide how many or how few chips you want the ante to be. Any bets you make will be in addition to the ante., The dealer starts with the person immediately to their left and then moves clockwise around the table or circle.


In 5 card stud the dealer deals the first card to each player face down. The rest of the cards are dealt face-up so that all players at the table can see them. Unlike Texas hold-em poker there are no community cards. Each person is dealt their own set of cards.In 7 card stud the dealer deals two cards face down to every player and then one card face up before the first betting round. After that betting round the dealer lays down three more cards face up and then the last card for each person is given face down. There is a betting round after each card.
The face down cards are referred to as the hole cards and the face up card is called the door card.

, In 7-card stud it is typical to bet after the first 3 cards are dealt, and then again after each subsequent card is dealt for a total of 5 bets. Although some games leave betting until the end, for a higher stakes stud poker game, players bet after receiving each card.In 5-card stud games the person who bets first is the person who has the best card showing. In 7-card stud the person with the lowest card showing bets first.You could also choose to play a limit game. As opposed to no limit games where you can bet as much as you want during each round of betting, bets in a limit game are set at fixed amounts. Generally a limit game features a big bet and a small bet. For example, the bets for a limit game might be $ 5 small bet and $ 10 big bet.
Some variations of limit games designate when each bet is placed. For the first two rounds of betting you can only bet using the small bet. In the last three rounds you can only bet using the big bet.The ante is set at 10 % of the big bet in a limit game. In our example, that would mean a $ 1 ante., After the first three cards have been dealt, players engage in another round of betting, bidding up the price of staying in the game. For example, if you like the cards that you have gotten you can bet additional chips on that hand. The other players have to choose to match your bet or fold their hand.In no-limit games you can bet as much as you want, whereas in limit games you're only able to bet in set increments.
Establish limits for bidding or betting. Bidding on a card hand is one of the most confusing and complex elements of stud poker. It's important for each player to know their options in the process. As the bidding goes around in a circular fashion, players always have the right to fold. This means they lose any further stake in the game. Without folding, they must either match the current total bid, or raise it by putting in even more money.
When the table has gone around with no raises, the players are said to have ""called"" the hand. It can be helpful to double check at the end of a round to make sure it has been effectively called and thus closed for further bidding., Once one round of betting has finished the dealer lays down another face up card for everyone. Based on how you feel about you card you can decide to raise, check, or fold.


If you don’t want to leave the game yet but you don’t want to bet more money you can check. However, you’re only allowed to check if everyone else checks too.If even one person raises and puts in another chip, you have to decide between matching their bet or folding. Folding takes you out of the game but you lose all the chips you have bet already.

, The dealer will deal another card face up card to every person and everyone will bet. Then the dealer will deal another card face up and everyone will bet. After this final bet it is time to evaluate your hands., This is where the players look at everyone's cards who is still in the game and determine who has the winning hand.

, Refer to the hand rankings to see who has the best combination of cards. Whoever has the best combination wins that particular hand.

, The winner of the hand gets all the chips that you have put in the pot. All the chips from the ante and any subsequent bets go to the winner. You can no longer win the chips once you fold.

, Once the winner has all their chips, you can ante up again and continue playing the game.

Play rounds until the players decide to stop.",How to Play Three Card Poker2," The hand ranking system is the same as in the casino game. If you know ordinary poker hand rankings, the only difference is that a straight is worth more than a flush. Here are the full rankings from highest to lowest:


3 of a Kind. All 3 cards have the same point value or the same face printed on the card.
Straight Flush. The 3 cards are in sequential point value and of the same suit.
Flush. The 3 cards are all of the same suit.
Straight. The 3 cards are in sequential point value.
Pair. Any 2 of the 3 cards have the same face point value.
High Card. The 3 cards do not match any of the groupings above. The highest value card is the value of the hand.

, Decide whether the Ace will only be used as the highest card in the deck, or whether it may be alternately be used as a 1 when forming a straight.


In order to play with any other additional ""house rules"", every player must agree to them before the game begins.

, You can decide who deals first randomly or through mutual agreement.


Deal these cards face down and clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's left.
Players may look only at their own card.

, Play moves clockwise from that player. Before the first bet has been made, each player has three options:



Open the betting. The player places any amount of money (or other wagered items) in the center of the table (in the pot).

Check. The player does not bet at this time but is still in this round.

Fold. The player withdraws from the current round. She takes no more actions until the next hand is dealt.
Note: If every player checks, skip straight to dealing the next card.
You may wish to agree on a minimum or maximum bet.

, The players now have three options:



Call. The player matches the amount of the previously made bet, placing that amount in the pot.

Raise. The player matches the amount of a previously announced bet, and adds an additional amount of money to it (their choice).

Fold. As before, the player withdraws from this round.

, Deal the cards face down to each player, starting with the player to the dealer's left.


Each player should add the new card to their (now 2-card) hand and keep them secret from other players.

, Repeat the wagering process until all of the remaining players have called or checked.

, This final card is added to each player's hand.

, Each remaining player has the option to Call, Raise, or Fold until a full circuit of the table has Called.


If all but one player decides to Fold, the remaining player wins the pot.

, Players lay their cards face up on the table. The winner is determined by the hand ranking. (See hand rankings listed earlier).

, The player with the highest hand is be the winner. If two players have the same type of hand, whoever has the highest ranked card wins.


The one exception comes up when comparing two hands of pairs. In this case the highest pair wins, not the highest cards. (For example, a 4-4-6 beats 2-2-10).

, The player to the previous dealer's left shuffles together all the cards and begins the next round.

, A player may walk away at any time or the players may mutually decide to stop. There is no required number of hands that must be played.

Calculate the number of players remaining in the tourney.,
Determine the capacity of your tables (most poker tables seat eight to ten players).,
Divide the number of players by the number of tables, integer only, remember the remainder.,
The resultant integer is the minimum number of players that should be at any table.,
The director should approach the short table, and determine the open spots, and where they relate to the dealer button.,After choosing the seat to fill, the director should approach the heavy table and alert the player in the same position to gather his or her chips to move.,Escort the player to the new table, carrying chips to assist, if necessary.,
Seat the player in the correct seat, and so long as the player did not split the blinds or move into the dealer button, he may participate in the next hand.,The tables are now as balanced as they can be; the next imbalance may only be a hand away.",How to Reseat Players in Poker Tournaments,"

For this example, 35 remain of 40 starting players. Table 1 - 10 players, T2 - 9p, T3 - 9p, T4 - 7p.;
,

For this example, there are four 10-seat tables

,

35 players divided by 4 tables is 8 with 3 remainder.

, The maximum at any table should be that number +1.

Based on the numbers, no table should have no more than 9, and should have at least 8 players. Thus, one player must be moved from T1 to T4.

, The best choice is to choose to fill a space immediately behind the dealer button - the seat currently occupied by the dealer button or one of the two immediately to the right.,,, If the player split the blinds (moved into the small), he must wait for the button to pass before entering a hand.,"

Move the match card (if unclaimed) and all cards that didn't match it to the discard pile.

,
Deal new active cards to each player.,
Deal a new card to the center and repeat the matching process.,
Have each player assemble the best poker hand possible using the cards in his or her stockpile.",How to Play Poker Roulette," Poker roulette requires a minimum of 3 players and a maximum of 5 if you're playing the game with a single deck. For each additional 5 players, you'll need another deck of cards.


Each deck of cards used should include both jokers.;
, Unlike most other poker games, poker roulette requires ties to be broken by suit. Cards are ranked numerically as in most poker games, with aces high and deuces low.

, This card is the ""stock"" card, the first card in the players' card stockpiles. Players can look at their stock cards but are not permitted to show them to their opponents.

, These cards are the ""active"" or ""pocket"" cards.

, This is the match card, to be matched by the players' active cards.

, Players can add matching active cards to their stockpiles according to these rules:


If either active card's suit or number matches that of the match card, the player adds that card to his or her stockpile.
If both cards match the active card numerically, the player adds both cards and the match card to the stockpile.
If both active cards match by suit, the player adds both active cards to the stockpile, but not the match card.
If 1 active card is a joker and the other active card matches the match card, the player adds both active cards to his or her stockpile.
If the match card is a joker and neither of the player's active cards is a joker, the player adds both active cards to his or her stockpile.
If both of a player's active cards are jokers, or if the match card is a joker and 1 of the active cards is a joker, both active cards are discarded.

,, Players who matched at least 1 of their active cards get 2 active cards, while players who could not match either active card to the match card get only 1.

, Continue this until the draw deck has been exhausted. Players may bet, raise, call, or fold during the card-matching phase.

, Poker hands contain a maximum of 5 cards, but players with stockpiles of 4 cards or fewer must make the best possible hand with the cards they have. Highest hand takes the pot, with ties broken by the agreed-upon suit ranking. Hand rank is as in normal poker: a royal flush beats a straight flush (both can only be made with 5 cards), which beats 4 of a kind (may be made with a 4-card stockpile), which beats a full house (requires 5 cards), which beats a flush (requires 5 cards), which beats a straight (requires 5 cards), which beats 3 of a kind (may be made with a 3- or 4-card stockpile), which beats 2 pair (requires at least a 4-card stockpile), which beats a pair (may be made with a 2-card stockpile), which beats high-card single.

Know the order of how the cards go.,
Dealing out the cards.,
Know which cards to put down.,
Start the game.,
Along with ranks, (3, 4, 5, … K, A, 2), suits are also important.,
2's are the highest card but you cannot use them in a combo, only a double (2, 2), triple (2, 2, 2) or quads (2, 2, 2, 2).,The player with a quad of 2's automatically wins (not many play with this rule, especially if you play for money)

,
Tien Len can only be played with the maximum of 4 players and a minimum of 2.,
Understand ""rotation"".,
Tien Len takes skills, practice, and remembering the cards that have been thrown down so you can guess the cards your opponents still have.",How to Play Tienlen," In Tienlen, the card goes from lowest to highest in this order: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A, and 2.

, Typically Tienlen is four players each with thirteen cards, but if you have more people or less people, you can try to make adjustments.

,


Whatever the person put down before, you usually put the same amount of cards going ahead in order of the last card.
For example: The person ahead of you puts out 4, 5, 6; You would put down 5, 6, 7 or something higher.
For pairs, if they went a pair of 4, you could go a pair of 4

, The winner goes first, but if this is the first round, who ever has the 3 of spade goes first. The 3 of spade can be used in a double, triple, combo, or by itself.

, The suit order from lowest to highest is: Spades, Club, Diamonds, Hearts.


For example, if a player puts down a 4 of Clubs, you can beat it with a 4 of Diamonds, 4 of Hearts, or any higher card such as 5, 6, 7…
Another example: if a player puts down a combo such as 3, 4, 5, 6, you can beat it with a 3, 4, 5, 6 but your 6's suit must be higher than the other player's 6.

, The only hands that can beat a single 2 is a quad of any card (3, 3, 3, 3 or K, K, K, K) or three consecutive pairs (4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6). Of course higher quads or higher three consecutive pairs can beat those. These are called bombs.

,, Each player can only have 13 cards. Jokers are not used.

, Let's say the game begins with a player putting down a pair of three (must include the 3 of spade), the next player must put down a higher pair, or a pair of three with a higher suit, and it continues until no one else is able to put down a pair. That is considered a single rotation. If a player skips within a rotation (because he or she does not or can not throw down the hand for that turn) that player can not play again for that rotation. The winner of a rotation gets to put down whatever he or she wants to for the next rotation.

, You do not have to put down the required cards within a rotation, sometimes it's best to save your good cards for other rotations. It is a game of strategy and luck. It's a great game to play when you're drinking with friends and to gamble with. Each player puts in a dollar per game, winner takes all. If a player throws down a 2 and you bomb him, he loses a dollar to you, but if your bomb is defeated by a higher one from another player, that player keeps your dollar and the dollar from the guy who threw down the 2. The money from bombs are separate from the initial money to start the game.

The player to the clockwise gets a turn now

, He/she can take the top card on the deck, the top card on the pile of thrown out card(s), or take more than one card form the dropped pile. If the player chooses to take more than one card, which only happens when grabbing form the drop pile, then the player must be able to play the last card, the furthest down in the grabbed cards at that time and must do so. If this is not possible the player may not grab these.

(The card dropped may play, but that is OK the player does not have to play it.)

, Cards on table in a set are added to a score and cards in your hand are subtracted. Number cards form 2 to 9 are each worth 5 points, 10's, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are 10 points, and Aces are 15 points.

Give the players the option of serving as banker.",How to Play Pai Gow Poker1," In pai gow poker, as in some other poker games, the joker is a limited wild card, or ""bug."" It may be treated as an ace, or used to fill out a straight, flush or straight flush.


Some casinos allow the joker to be completely wild.;
, Unlike other poker games, there are no calls or raises, although there may be side bets.

, The remaining cards are discarded.

, Starting with himself or herself, the dealer counts clockwise around the table up to the number rolled on the dice. That player gets first choice of the stacks; then the remaining players get to choose, going counterclockwise.


If there are fewer than 7 players, some casinos assign the leftover stacks to ""dragon"" hands, particularly when there is only a single empty seat.

, The banker is the person whose hands must be beaten to win the round. If none of the players wish to be the banker, that role falls to the house (dealer).


The advantage in serving as the banker is that the banker wins all ""copies"" or ties. The disadvantage is that the banker has to arrange his or her cards according to the rules the house uses for its dealer's hand. Many casinos also require a player who serves as banker to have enough money to cover the other players' bets.
Some casinos allow a player to share banking duties with the house, sharing half of the proceeds or losses, provided the player builds his or her hands the house way.
Some casinos also require a player to have played against the house once before being allowed to serve as banker.
If one of the players serves as banker, the dealer makes a bet for the house equal to the amount that player last bet when the house served as banker.

Congratulate the player next to you.",How to Play Pocket Aces in Texas Hold'em Poker," Don't do a double-take, or laugh, or smile, or play a smokescreen by frowning. All you need to do is remain neutral. Look at your chips, or even think about what you had for breakfast yesterday. This way no one will guess you have pocket rockets (A-A).;
, If you are big/small blind, you might like to just call if someone raised before you. If you are the first to bet, just call the big blind, or if you want, you can raise by a small portion (eg. If it is 4 to call, bet 6 or 8). Don't push all in, or bet something like 5 times the blind. Put in as many raises as possible, especially if you are out of position. Never re-raise pre-flop.

, If someone goes all in preflop, you should call them. Let some people get out, and then win that money back over time. That's how pros play.

, Play accordingly to the following situations (play the style that is most like the flop):


High cards: K - 10 - J = Raise to about 10, or call a bet of a similar value (up to 30). Be wary of all in because it is possible to have a straight.






The triple: A - 6 - 10 = Do a small raise on most anything.






Quick straight: 5 - 7 - 6 = Be wary, but call for now.






Nothing: 4 - 8 - 2 = Small raise on anything.






Dangerous: K - K - Q = Call for now, but later on, fold to a raise from a conservative player.

, If the river shows there are 4 cards in a row, be wary of the small raise. Play likewise for suited cards (of which you have none). Play a small raise here., If this doesn't give you 3 aces, be wary of a large raise. If you are looking good though, raise the raise. If they then raise, just call., If you win the hand, allow yourself a small smile, but don't gloat. If you lose, keep thinking about yesterday's breakfast.

, If you decide to play No Limit, it's suggested buying in for the minimum amount. If you are going to play Limit, then 20-25x the big blind is a good amount.


Once you've been seated and begin playing, you will soon win your first pot in live poker. As you are stacking your chips, always remember to tip the dealer. This is common courtesy, and at low limits a tip anywhere from $0.50 to $2.00 is plenty, although the amount is completely up to you.

Divide your stack into poker hands.,
Make the best possible high hand you can.,
Make the best possible low hand you can.",How to Play Pai Gow Poker2," Divide the cards into a group of 5 cards, which forms a regular 5-card poker hand, and a group of 2 cards, which either makes a pair or doesn't. The 5-card hand is the high hand, and the 2-card hand is the low hand. The goal is to have both hands beat those held by the banker.

, High hands of 5 cards are ranked from high to low as in most poker games, allowing for the joker serving as a bug. The hands are as follows:


Five aces (using the joker as the fifth ace).
Royal flush (ace, king, queen, jack, and 10 of the same suit).
Straight flush (5 cards in sequence of the same suit) � Deviates from regular poker in that A-2-3-4-5 beats a king-high straight flush.
Four of a kind (4 cards of the same rank).
Full house (3 cards of the same rank and a pair of a different rank).
Flush (5 cards of the same suit).
Straight (5 cards in sequence) � Ranks A-2-3-4-5 above a king-high straight but below an ace straight with face cards.
Three of a kind (3 cards of the same rank).
Two pair.
One pair.

, Low hands of 2 cards rank pairs over unpaired cards, and rank high cards over low cards. Pairs rank aces high, deuces low and unpaired cards rank ace-king high to 3-2 low.


A low hand cannot be higher than a low hand. If it is, the hand is declared ""foul"" and the player forfeits the bet. A player with only a single pair out of the 7 cards dealt, and no straights or flushes, must play it in the high hand. A player with 2 pairs may choose to play both pairs in the high hand or the higher pair in the high hand and the lower pair in the low hand. A player with 3 pairs may assign the pairs to the high and low hand however he or she wishes, as two pair beat a single pair.
As noted previously, the banker's hand is formed according to house rules, as is the dealer's hand. Any players playing dragon hands in addition to their own must play from the dragon hand according to the house way.

Reveal all players' hands.

,
Compare the players' high hands against the banker's high hand and their low hands against the banker's low hand.",How to Play Pai Gow Poker3,", Both a player's high hand and low hand must beat the banker's corresponding hands for a player to win the bet. If a player wins one hand, but loses the other, neither side wins (a ""push""). If the banker wins both hands, the banker wins the bet from the player.


If one of the banker's hands is identical to the player's hand, the player is considered to have a ""copy"" hand and the banker wins that hand. If both hands are tied, or if the banker wins either the high or low hand and the other is tied, the banker wins the player's bet. If the player wins one hand and ties the other, the game is a push where neither side wins money.

First, you need at least five people who know how to play poker.,
Set the rules.,
Spread the word.,
Once everybody has registered and submitted their buy-in money, divide people up into groups.,
When people arrive on the day of the tournament, give them their chips and start the games.,
Eventually, there will be one table left with the best (or luckiest) players at it.,
The last person standing gets the prize pot, but you might want to award some money to second and third-place finishers, too.,
Clean up, thank the dealers, send off the money to the charitable organization, and you're done.",How to Organize a Charity Poker Tournament," At least ten or twenty people is even better. You'll also need several decks of cards, sets of chips, and people who are willing to be dealers.;
, Decide which type of poker will be played (Texas Hold'Em is a popular one), what the buy-in will be, what the prize pot will be worth, and whether people who lose can buy themselves back in (and for how much).

, Let everybody know what's going on and invite everyone you can. The more people enter, the more money the charity will make.

, This will depend on how many people you have, but separating people into tables of six to ten players will work. Do not lock the tourney line-up in advance of game day; take seat reservations in advance, but a tourney will see a lot of walk up players on game day if it is well-publicized.

, Everybody should begin with the same amount of chips.


People will play until they run out of chips, and then they can either buy back in (paying more money for a fresh stack of chips) or quit.
As play continues, players will bust out and choose to leave. When you are playing multiple tables, it is unfair to have a large disparity in the number of players at each table. During play, the tournament director should re-seat players at different tables to keep a reasonable balance. If at a three table tourney where 10 players start on each, a particular table experiences a rash of bust outs and is left with 7 players while the other two lose only one between them. Players at the table of 7 are playing 30% more hands in the blinds, which causes irritation to the players. Refer to Reseat Players in Poker Tournements.

, Keep going until one person has won.

, Whatever money doesn't go to the winners is for charity.

Examine the present situation of no-limit poker.,
Adopt a loose playing style but with starting hands that have a higher winning percentage.,
When playing loose, be aware of your position, play speculative hands with pot odds and implied odds from the middle or later positions.,
To specifically deal with loose players examine how they play.,
Deal with loose player beyond the flop with continuation bets or C Bets - do not let them see the later streets for free if you think they did not connect with the flop.,
Raise when you have a good hand preflop.,
Be prepared for the possibility of facing an all-in or a big raise.,
Consider folding top pair when facing a big raise.,
Postflop, extract as much money as you can from the loose player.

,
Categorize the loose players as aggressive or passive and adjust your bet size.",How to Play Against Any Two Cards Players," A lot of players are: 1) young and young people tend to play loose. 2) many players, of any age group, play too loose. Regardless if a tighter style is better, a conclusion that a loose style is superior can determined just on tournament results. The results of a tournament will tend to favor the dominant make up of players. But these are tournament results and not individual results, so a statement that most tournaments are won by loose players thus a loose playing style is advocated does not hold water.;
, When the blinds are low, play more hands without high cards that can develop into flushes and straights. A hand's qualities are based on high card strength, suitedness and connectedness.. Play speculative hands when the blinds are bigger with position, when you have a big stack and passive table conditions.

, Do not play these hands if the table conditions are temporarily aggressive or if the player(s) after you are loose and aggressive.

, These players will want to see the flop cheaply and will want to see many flops. They will fold on the flop if they did not connect with the flop. If they connect with the flop, even with a long shot draw such as a gut shot, they might continue despite having inadequate implied odds.

, Even if you or your opponent did not connect with the flop, bet, you will tend to be favored because of your higher standards. Beware to traps set my loose players and bluffs. Think about the bet size, pot size, betting patterns. Categorize your opponents and factor in the tilt factor.

, Loose players want to see the flop cheaply and raising prevents them from doing so. The standard raise is 3x of the big blind and this amount should be adjusted to the blind size, the present table conditions and for the players on the table. When the blind are smaller, raise more than 3x and when the blinds are bigger raise less than 3x. Raise more than 3x if that is what is necessary to knock out a player.

, By thwarting the style of loose players, they may retaliate by throwing in a big raise or go all-in. Preflop, you must usually fold

, A pair is the lowest of all made hands and the average winning hand is two pair. When making a decision, factor in all possibilities, for example when you have a top pair with A-J and a flop of A-T-3, your opponent could also have top pair, a middle or low pair, two pair, a set, a straight draw or nothing. Check the pot size, your opponent's stack size, how this player has played this hand and previous hands and what this player's motivation could be.

,, The four categories of players would be: loose aggressive, loose passive, tight aggressive, and tight passive. Additionally, notice how players play preflop and postflop.

Understand the nature of the game.,
Acknowledge the strength of your starting hand.,
Examine the table.,
Adopt the proper strategy based on your starting hand.",How to Play 7 Card Stud2," 7 Card Stud is a high-card game. Standard poker rules apply (e.g., full house beats flush, etc.), but big hands are difficult to come by. High pairs and 2 pairs often take pots in 7 Card Stud.

, In order to continue playing the hand, you should have a stronger starting hand than just a straight or flush draw. View a split low pair, where one of the cards is face down and the other is showing, skeptically. Low pairs usually have to be improved upon to win pots.

, The cards that are showing help determine the viability of your hand. This is crucial if you're playing a flush or straight draw, or have a low pair.


Flush draw: You should have 2 or more high cards to continue. If you don't get a suited card or a high pair on 4th Street, check or fold. Fold if 3 or more cards of the suit you are pursuing are showing on the table. Such cards are called dead cards.
Straight draw: Employ similar tactics to the flush draw. You need at least 2 high cards. Fold if you don't continue the straight draw or get a high pair on 4th Street.
Low pair: Proceed cautiously to 4th Street. Fold if 1 or both of the key cards are dead, or if the 4th Street card doesn't provide you with a 2 pair.

, Use 1 of 3 basic approaches to maximize your chances of taking the pot.


Fast play: Use this strategy when you want to force other players out of the game early. The tactic involves aggressive betting, including raising and re-raising at maximums. Fast play when you have a high pair or high trips (3 of a kind) in your starting hand.
Slow play: This tactic is more nuanced and keeps you in the game without taxing your bankroll. In slow play, you check and call bets in the hope of moving into the next round of betting, where you might get a card that transforms your hand into a formidable one. Slow play most hands, including low trips. The strategy here is to draw other players into the betting against your strong hand.
Check/fold: Use this strategy when you have a low pair and are searching for a card to make a 3 of a kind. Check when you can, but fold when another player bets.

The main part of constructing a poker table involves making the tabletop. If you want it to have legs, choose a folding table or another table to attach the tabletop to it with drywall screws before you cover it with foam and fabric.
By building a separate tabletop, you will have a portable poker table, that can slide on a table each time you play. It can also be stored on its side or moved to another location.;

Allow it to dry according to the directions on the adhesive package.,, (If you decide to use felt, ensure the felt is of a high-quality and is not very fuzzy. If it is, it will start to pill with use or catch on the edges of the cards.) Cut the fabric so that it is about 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) larger than the foam all around, or 2 inches (50 mm) larger than the plywood on all ends.

Again, ask a friend to help you center your fabric over the top of the foam and the new coat of glue. Lay it gently upon the glue. Pull the cloth and smooth it with your hands, to ensure there are not any wrinkles or air bubbles. Allow the glue to dry according to package directions. You will have a table top with a stiff skirt of foam and fabric hanging over the edge.

, Repeat on each of the corners and at the middle point on each side of the table. You want the fabric to be pulled tightly., This will give you a clean surface to work on. Get a few people to help you gather the ends and flip the table onto the ground so that the fabric top is laying on the towels.

Staple parallel to the table's edge every 1 inch (25.4 mm). Ensure that you are stapling both the fabric and the foam to the plywood. This ring of staples will secure your tabletop.

If you don't, you could have a winning hand and not even realize it! So before we tackle anything specific to 5-card, let's establish the hierarchy of hands, starting with the lowest:


High card (aka a big fat nothing)
One pair
Two pair
Three of a kind
Straight
Flush
Full house
Four of a Kind
Straight Flush
Royal Flush
Five of a kind (if playing with a wild card);
, So now that you know the hands, how do you play the actual game? Well, for starters, you're trying to make the highest-ranked hand. Here are the basics, and we'll get to specifics in the next section (Setting Up the Game):


The dealer deals everyone 5 cards
Initial bets are placed
Players request new cards, throwing away a portion of their old cards, forming the best hand possible
Another round of bets takes place
Players still standing show their cards
The player with the best hand takes the pot

, 5-card has two possible variants when it comes to beginning any round: blind or ante. It's all a matter of personal preference -- or how your friends feel!


In blind games, the person to the left of the dealer is the ""small blind."" They put up a bet (usually incredibly small and always half of the big blind) before any hands are dealt. The person to left of the small blind is the ""big blind"" -- they, too, put in a bet before any hands are dealt, though their bet is twice the small blind. Anyone who wants to play the round (after the hands are dealt) has to match the big blind to play.
In ante games, everyone has to put a predetermined amount into the pot in order to be dealt any cards. It discourages folding, at least initially.

, After the dealer has dealt you your five cards and the betting rolls around to you, you have three options: to call, raise, or fold. Everyone has their own strategy as to how to go about this, but here's what they are:



Checking is basically betting 0. If no bets have been placed, you can check. But the second someone places a bet, you then must call, raise, or fold.

Calling is when you match the bet that's on the table. If everyone has put 10 cents into the pot to play, you put 10 cents into the pot to play.
""Raising"" is when you increase the amount of money in the pot. If the player to your left put in 10 cents and you put in 15, you have raised the bet 5. Players must then match your bet (call) to stay in play.

Folding is when you want out. You throw your cards face down on the table and you're finished for that round, no money won, some lost.

, 5-card is a very fun game, but an extra element of surprise and strategy comes into play when you introduce wild cards. Just make sure everyone agrees on this (and what it is) beforehand. This makes the ""5 of a kind"" a potential hand -- and the best one at that.


Some play deuces wild (2s), while others will take the first card off the deck (after the deal) and play with the remaining three as wild. Still others play with the one-eyed Jack or or a joker inserted into the deck (playing with 53 cards).
If you do play with a wild card, decide if there are any restrictions on it; this is known as a ""bug."" A joker inserted into the deck may only be able to represent an Ace or to finish a straight or flush; it cannot be any random number a player picks.

, More variations! If you want to exercise some control over the amount of money flowing over the table, you'll incorporate some kind of limit into your game. But you don't have to! It can prevent players from running out of (and thus losing) money, a big spender bullying the others, and things getting out of hand. Again, three options:



No limit. Pretty self-explanatory.

Limit. You decide what the minimum and maximum bets are -- and these can be different in the initial and second betting rounds.

Pot limit. No bet may be greater than what's already in the pot.

, Sometimes everyone's hands suck. In that situation, playing lowball is an option -- where you try to get the lowest hand possible. So if and when everyone's gone around the table and no one wants in or everyone is checking, switching to lowball is an option.


In this variation, generally Aces switch to low (normally, they're high) and straights and flushes don't count. So the worst possible hand you could have would be A-2-3-4-5.You have no pairs and 5 is your highest card. Womp womp.

, 5-card is best played with around 6 people, though 4-8 is good, too, and you could fudge 3 if you absolutely had to. Clear off your dining room table, grab a bowl of chips, and set everyone down. They all know how to play, right?


If they don't, show them this page and put them in the corner for 5 minutes. Or let them play cluelessly and take their money before they even realize it!

, If you don't have actual poker chips laying around, you'll need things to bet with and to assign them a correlating value. Anything small that you have a lot of will do just fine. Paperclips? Those are worth 5. And the peanuts? 10. Just make sure you don't eat them absent-mindedly.


It's a good idea to have denominations of 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1, though ultimately it's up to you. Do you wanna bet $1000 at a time? Go ahead -- just make sure everyone has the chump change to back it up. And if you are making sure everyone fulfills their bets, state explicitly that 1 is 1 cent or 1 dollar! That makes a bit of a difference.

, You read that first section, right? Well, do you want to start your game with a blind or an ante? It's all just about the same amount of money in the end. It's just easier to cop out in a blind!


If you do choose blind, be sure to rotate it with each round. The dealer, small blind, and big blind should move one space to the left with each deal. So the small blind becomes the dealer, the big blind becomes the small blind, and the next guy to the left becomes the big blind. Capsize?

, Shuffle that deck up well! No stacking it. And then have the dealer hand the deck to the player on their right to cut it. They then deal the deck, 5 to a player, starting with the player on the left.


Who's the dealer? Good question. You could either do it voluntarily, by age, or by a simple, quick who's-got-the-highest-card before play begins.

, Alright, so either your blinds or your antes are established, the first round of cards is dealt, and betting commences. If you're playing blind, begin with the player to the left of the blinds. If you're playing ante, begin with the player to the left of the dealer.


Let's say there's players A, B, C, and D. Player A (the one to the left of the dealer) checks. B could check (betting 0), but he bets 5. C then has to either bet 5 (or more), or fold; he folds. D then calls, also betting 5. It comes back to A -- he never put any money in -- who has to call, raise, or fold. He calls.

, Now that everyone has either bet or folded, the draw round starts. The players give the dealer the cards they don't want in exchange for the same amount of new cards in return; the hand is still (and always) comprised of 5 cards. The dealer starts with the player to his left, as usual.


In some variations, only 3 cards can be tossed away. In some 4, if you have an ace. And in others, all 5 can be thrown in. It's up to you and your friends which variant you want to play.

, Now that everyone has their semi-new hands, betting begins again, starting with the same person as last time. It's the same protocol, only generally the stakes are higher. Let's take our same example from before:


If you recall, C has folded and everyone else is in. A puts in 5, B puts in 5, and D puts in 10. A folds, and B ""sees"" his 10 (putting in 5 more) and raises 15 (20 in total). D calls, putting in 15 more.

, When it's down to two players, it's showdown time. The player who played the last big move (in this case, B) generally exposes his hand first. The second player lays his cards down, too, and the winner sweeps up the pot.


The second player can choose to never turn his face cards up if he admits defeat verbally. This can add an element of mystery and strategy -- was he just bluffing the entire time? No one will know.

, This is just general poker guideline #1 -- don't do it. If you do reveal your cards, the other players can start to deduce when you fold (and thus when you don't) and what other cards are likely on the table. It can be distracting, too! So just don't do it. It's in your best interest, after all.


Really, just don't reveal anything you don't have to. This game is just as much about psychology as it is about luck and strategy! Which brings up the next point.

, Those guys aren't wearing their sunglasses inside just to channel Corey Hart.Keep your face and body unreadable if you can help it. Or fake 'em out, whichever. The people across from you are probably trying to figure out your playing style -- so make it as difficult for them as possible.


It's best to just not be ruffled by anything. If you have a good hand, so be it. If you have a bad hand, so be it. If you have an incredibly mediocre hand, so be it. There's no room for feelings in poker, kid.

, It's not uncommon for a newbie poker player to win, partly based on the fact that they don't know what they're doing and haven't developed a tried-and-true strategy; they kind of just go by the seat of their pants. Because of this, their opponents have no idea what to expect. So switch up how you attack the game in two ways: how you bet and how you draw.


The betting is pretty straight-foward. Sometimes bet when you have a terrible hand, sometimes don't. Sometimes do outrageous raises, sometimes fold all too easily. Sometimes raise when you can call, sometimes call when you probably should've raised, etc. There's infinite possibilities.
The number of cards you draw is actually pretty telling. If you draw one, your opponents probably think you have two pair or you're gunning for a flush or a straight. So even if you'd think about drawing two, this could be a strategy. Or vice versa!

, You can hem and haw a little when placing your bets -- everyone needs a minute once in a while to wrap their brain around the game -- but don't waste everyone's time with each round. The game is a lot more exciting when it keeps going. If you don't have a goldfish's clue as to what to do after a minute, just go for it. It's called the learning process.

, Poker players take their game very seriously. Have you ever walked into a poker tournament and started making noise? You'll be escorted out faster than you can fold 'em. So be polite. Don't cause a stir, be purposefully distracting or obnoxious, and keep to yourself. People are trying to make money here.


In general, be quiet when you're out. If you've folded, you have no business getting in on the mix. Just watch, have fun observing, and let the hand play out. You'll learn more from watching than you will any other way.
Don't splash into the pot. If you're making a big bet, don't throw your money into the pot; it becomes much, much harder to count that way. Instead, put it in in stacks of 5 or 10. It keeps things clean and simple.
Be a gracious winner and loser. Attitudes can easily ruin this game, so don't do it. If you mopped the floor with them, don't rub it in their faces. And if you were the mop, kindly demand a rematch. Same time next week?

Learn the percentages of your favorite poker game.,
Consider all cogent variables before calculating hand odds.,
Determine the number of outs available to you.,
Calculate the percentage of the time you will hit your hand with a single card.,
Find the flop-to-river percentage: This is a more difficult calculation because it involves 2 cards in separate draws, the turn and river.,
Turn your hand percentage into an odds ratio.,
Determine the pot odds.",How to Learn Poker Percentages," Determining poker odds depends in large part on the game you're playing. For example, the formula for getting a particular hand in 7-card stud is different from that of Texas Hold 'em, arguably the most popular poker game in the world.;
, Hand odds represent the chances of the turn and/or river cards helping you make a good hand.


Make your calculations after the flop. In Texas Hold'em, you'll be dealt 2 cards. The dealer will then unveil 3 cards, called the flop, which all players can use to build the strongest hand possible.
Base your calculations only on the facts available to you. Resist the inclination to make projections on what cards other players may be holding. For the purpose of accurately determining your chance of building a strong hand, only concern yourself with the cards you're holding and the flop.

, Outs are cards that directly contribute to the hand you're trying to build. In some cases, you may have only 2 outs, meaning your chances of attaining a desirable hand is remote. Under ideal circumstances, 1 of 15 different outs can complete a strong hand. To tally your outs, you'll need to carefully assess your hand after the flop and then decide what hand you can attain. For example:


Nothing: If your hold cards are unsuited and lower than at least 1 of the cards in the flop, you have 6 outs to achieve a pair. For example, say you drew a 5 and a 9. Any of the 3 remaining 5's or 9's in the deck would give you at least a pair. Therefore, you'd have 6 outs for the turn and river.
Pocket pair: If your hold cards are a low pair (meaning at least 1 of the flop cards is higher, possibly giving another player a higher pair than yours), you have only 2 outs to make 3 of a kind or better.
2 overcards: If you're holding 2 cards, say an ace and a queen, that are higher than any of the 3 flop cards, you have 6 outs: the remaining 3 aces and queens.
Flush draw: A flush draw occurs when your hold cards are suited and the flop contains 2 cards of that same suit. With 4 suited cards in your hand, and 13 cards per suit, you'll have 9 outs to achieve a flush.
Flush and open-straight draw: To illustrate this scenario, say you've drawn the jack and 10 of diamonds, and the flop is the 9 of spades, and the 8 and 4 of diamonds. You're in a very advantageous position with 15 outs. Any diamond (9 outs for a flush) or any queen or 7, (6 outs total to complete the straight).

,


To determine the chances of the river card being the one you need to complete your hand, subtract your outs from the number of cards remaining. Only consider the cards you have in determining the number remaining. So for the river, there are 46 cards left: 52 -6 (2 hold cards, 3 flops and 1 turn).
Divide the result by the number of cards remaining to find your hand percentage.

,


To find the hand percentage for a flush draw, subtract the number of outs from the number of cards remaining for the turn (47-9) and divide by 47. The quotient is 0.81.
For the river, subtract the outs (9) from the cards remaining (46) and divide the result by 46. This quotient is 0.80.
Multiply the 2 quotients. The result is 0.65.
Subtract 0.65 from 1 to find the hand percentage. The result is 0.35, meaning you have a 35 percent chance of getting a flush off a flush draw.

, This is an important step in becoming an effective Texas Hold'em player. The hand odds will need to be compared to the pot odds to determine whether to stay in the game. To find hand odds, follow this procedure.


Express your hand percentage as a whole number. For example, 24 percent becomes 24.
Divide 100 by this number. The result is 4.17.
Round the result to the nearest whole number, which in this example is 4.
Subtract 1 to find the ratio. The hand odds in this example are 3-1.

, The pot odds represent the number of times out of 100 you need to achieve a hand to break even. Professional poker players compare the pot odds to the hand odds before calling bets on the turn and river. When pot odds exceed hand odds, a solid betting situation exists.


After the flop, there is $50 in the pot. The first player raises $10.
To stay in the game, you must match the raise, or ""call"" the bet.
A $10 bet into a $50 pot represents pot odds of 5-1.
Bet into the game if your hand odds are better (lower) than the pot odds. Otherwise, fold.

Recognize the cards that make up a royal flush.,
Recognize which poker games are better for making a royal flush.,
Know when to hold ‘em.,
Know when to fold ‘em.",How to Make a Royal Flush," A royal flush is an ace-high straight flush, a set of five cards in the sequence ace-king-queen-jack-ten of the same suit.


In poker games that allow wild cards, wild cards may substitute for any of the cards in the royal flush. A royal flush made without wild cards is called a “natural” royal flush.;
, Poker hands are ranked according to their respective rarity. The royal flush is rankest highest because it is harder to make than any other straight flush, while a straight flush is harder to make than four of a kind, which is harder to make than a full house, which is harder to make than a flush, which is harder to make than a straight, which is harder to make than three of a kind, which is harder to make than two pair, which is harder to make than a single pair.How hard it is to make a royal flush depends on the poker game you’re playing.


The hardest poker games to make a royal flush in are those where you are dealt only five cards. In five-card draw or stud poker, your chances, in general, of getting a royal flush are 1 in 649,740. (There are 2,598,960 possible five-card poker hands, only four of which can be royal flushes. The royal flushes are four of 40 possible straight flushes; the chances of getting any straight flush are 1 in 64,974.)Your chances of getting a royal flush are better in draw poker games where you can throw away bad cards and draw new ones than in stud games where you have to play the cards you’re dealt.
Your chances also improve if you have been dealt some of the cards that make up a royal flush; if you’ve been dealt four of the five cards, you have a 1 in 47 chance of getting the fifth.Poker games where you are dealt more than five cards improve your chances of getting a royal flush. In seven-card stud or Texas hold’ em, your overall chances improve to 1 in 30,940. (In Texas hold ‘em, getting a royal flush on the “flop” or first three community cards, your chances are still 1 in 649,740, but they improve to 1 in 108,290 when the fourth or “turn” card comes out, and then to 1 in 30,940 when the river or appears.)They are still better in Omaha hold ‘em, in which you have nine cards (four hole and five community) from which to make your poker hand.Poker games where you play with fewer than 52 cards also improve your chances of getting a royal flush. Your chances of getting a royal flush increase significantly in the Texas hold ‘em variant Royal hold ‘em, where the only cards are the aces, kings, queens, jacks, and tens stripped from a regulation deck, or 20 cards in all.In this game, there are only 4,845 possible hands, raising your chances of making a royal flush to 1 in 1211.25.
The use of wild cards also increases your chances of getting a royal flush, as the wild card can substitute for any of the natural cards in the royal flush. Cards from the regulation 52-card deck made wild improve your chances slightly more than jokers, which add to the number of cards in the deck.

, As noted, you stand a better chance of making a royal flush if you’ve been dealt at least some of the cards that make up a royal flush.


If you’ve been dealt four of the cards that make up a royal flush, your chances of getting the fifth card are 1 in 47.
If you’ve been dealt three of the cards that make up a royal flush, your chances of getting a fourth card to make up the royal flush are 2 in 47. Your chances of getting both of the cards you need, however, is 1 in 1081.
If you’ve been dealt two of the cards that make up a royal flush, your chances of getting the other three drop to 1 in 16,215.
If you’ve been dealt only one of the cards that make up a royal flush, your chances of getting the other four drop to 1 in 178,365.

, The more cards that make up a royal flush you’re dealt, the better your chances of making it. Which cards of the flush you’re dealt also have an impact on whether you should try to play for the royal flush or settle for a lesser hand.


If you’ve been dealt four cards of the royal flush, you have a better chance of getting a winning hand if you have the king, queen, jack, and ten instead of the ace, king, queen, and jack. With an ace-high hand, you have to hope to draw the ten of the same suit (a 1 in 47 proposition); otherwise, the best hand you can get, by drawing a lower card of the same suit, is an ace-high flush, which can be beaten by any straight flush, four of a kind, or full house. With a king-high hand, you have a 2 in 47 chance of getting either a royal flush or king-high straight flush (by drawing a nine of the same suit), which is the second-best poker hand you can get.
You should also try to play for the royal only if you have consecutive cards and can try to draw the cards outside those you already have instead of those between those you have. If you have non-consecutive cards, such as the ace, king, jack, and ten, while you have the same 1 in 47 chance of drawing the queen of the same suit that you would of drawing an ace of the suit when you have the king through the ten, if you don’t get the queen, your best possible hand would again be an ace-high straight with a queen of a different suit. (This rule is often expressed as “Don’t draw to an inside straight.”)"

Remember the lowest-ranking poker hands with the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3.,
Divide the hands with the straight.,
Memorize the order the highest-ranking poker hands by counting the number of letters in the name of the hand.",How to Learn Poker Hands,"


0: High card. You have 0 pairs, and the value of your hand is dependent on the value of your highest card. Remember that a 2 is the lowest card and an ace is the highest.
1: One Pair. You have 2 cards of the same value in different suits such as the 2 of clubs and the 2 of hearts.
2: Two Pairs. You have two pairs of cards of the same value in different suits such as a 2 of clubs and a 2 of hearts as well as a 3 of spades and a 3 of diamonds.
3: Three of a Kind. You have 3 cards of the same value in different suits such as a 4 of clubs, 4 of spades, and 4 of diamonds.;
, This hand falls in the middle of the poker hand rankings. A straight is 5 cards of consecutive values in any suit. For example, a straight might consist of a 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in any combination of suits or it might be a 10, jack, queen, king and ace of any combination of suits.

,


5: Flush. This consists of 5 cards of any value the same suit such as a 2, 6, 7, 9 and jack of diamonds.
9: Full House. This is a combination of one pair and three of a kind.
11: Four of a Kind. This is 4 cards of the same value in all 4 suits such as a 9 of clubs, 9 of diamonds, 9 of spades and 9 of hearts.
13: Straight Flush. This consists of 5 cards of consecutive values in a single suit such as a 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of diamonds.
18: Royal Straight Flush. This is a straight flush with an ace as a high card such as a 10, jack, queen, king and ace of spades. This is an unbeatable hand.

Relax your face.,

Blink occasionally to avoid staring.,
Keep your lips together and jaw relaxed.,
Look straight ahead.,
Wear sunglasses to conceal where you are looking.,
Relax your posture.,
Avoid fidgeting or adjusting your body or clothes.,
Divert any tension to something else.,
Speak with an even and balanced tone.,
Keep your words few and simple.,
Nod your head if you aren’t comfortable speaking.,
Confuse your opponents by talking constantly.",How to Have a Good Poker Face," Your face is the first giveaway that could cost you a game of poker. Keeping your emotions and reactions in check regarding hands dealt to you is a key part of poker. Any type of expression sacrifices your power in situations with your opponents. Clear your mind, wiggle your face to loosen the muscles, take a deep breath, and relax.You want to be in control of the situation and if you’re too stressed, you can lose that control.
Hiding your reactions is power, because no one knows what you’re thinking or what you’re about to do.;
, You can win the upper hand by showing people you are confident and intimidating by locking eyes with them. Meeting people’s eyes also shows that you have nothing to hide so they don’t know what to expect from you. Look at the bridge of their nose to stare them down and keep your focus., Staring into space or focusing too hard on your cards is also how your poker face can be compromised. It either shows that you aren’t paying attention, or that you’re concerned for your hand and chances. Remind yourself to blink so that your eyes don’t dry out while you concentrate.Excessive blinking can also show nervousness, so don’t go overboard. There’s a balance between blinking enough to keep from staring and keeping your eyes focused so they don’t flit around.
Staring too hard can also cause your shoulders to bunch up and posture to suffer.
Focusing too hard on one thing visually can also distract you and you may miss an important play.

, Your mouth is the main support for your face muscles and any tension, smile, frown, or smirk will influence the rest of your face. Relax your jaw first by letting it go slack, creating space between your back teeth.Open and close your mouth a few times to help relax as well.


Avoid showing your teeth. Whether it’s for a small grin or grimace, visible teeth means your mouth is moving and movement can give you away.
Don’t grind your teeth. Your jaw will show the pressure your teeth are under.

, Don’t look up or to the left or right out of the corners of your eyes. These are all tells which are little clues to your opponents that you have something to hide, whether it’s a good hand of cards or bad. It’s hard to do, but minimize your eye movements. Even squinting or excessive eye brow raises can give away your reaction.

, In order to protect yourself, wear sunglasses so you don’t have to worry about giving anything away with your eyes. Sunglasses won’t be a problem indoors if you have enough lighting., Take a deep breath, raise your shoulders up to your ears, and let them drop down. Arch your back and then let it settle into a natural, upright position. Shake out any tense limbs and roll your head around on your neck. All of these will help you get back to a proper posture and break up any tension you have built up that will reveal your anxiety., Whether you’re excited or nervous, small twitches are a big giveaway to your emotions.Take a mental note to see if you’re exhibiting any little movements that come from nervous energy. Pay attention to yourself to make sure you’re not demonstrating any of these tics:


Knuckle cracking
Fingernail biting
Tapping fingers
Pulling on your collar or tie or shirt sleeves
Rubbing your face, hands together, or arms, Hold a stress ball or curl your hand into a fist to take any tension your body is storing. It can be hard to make yourself relax your entire body, so if you have to tense up, try allowing only one part of your body to hold that stress.


Conceal any movement or tension that you have. For example, hold your fist under the table or press your knees together to redirect any tension to where no one can notice it.
Don’t grip your cards too tightly or you’ll have white knuckles which will show.

, Your voice is also capable of revealing your emotions. A quiver in your voice or jumping to another octave while speaking is an easy tell for your opponents. Clear your throat or take a full breath before speaking so that you have enough air to talk in a neutral register., Stick to the facts of what’s happening and you won’t need too many words. Stumbling over your sentences, stuttering, or saying “um” too many times shows that you are nervous or unsure of yourself. Short, sweet, and to the point is how you should talk when in high-stress situations.


One word answers are acceptable, especially in high-stakes games like poker. You need to concentrate more on the game anyways rather than shooting the breeze with your opponents.
If you're playing a game with friends and there isn't a real money at stake, the atmosphere may be a little more relaxed so talking may more appropriate. Just watch yourself when examining your hand.

, When asked a question by the dealer or someone else, it’s acceptable to simply answer “yes” or “no” by nodding or shaking your head. If you don’t feel comfortable opening your mouth because you’re afraid that your voice will give you away, simply use relaxed body language to convey your answer.To distract yourself and keep from speaking, chew gum or keep snacks at the table.
It helps to think about what you want to say before you speak. That way you can keep yourself from sounding excited or disappointed.

, To be completely counter-intuitive, instead of staying silent you can comment on every hand dealt or result. You can pepper in false reactions too to throw your opponents off. Constantly talking can also distract your opponents by diverting their attention from the game to whatever you're saying.


Bluffing is an important part of poker. For example, you can receive a bad hand and pretend like you just got a winning hand.
If you're consistently inconsistent with your reactions, no one will be able to guess your true reactions. This is much harder to do but can work in your favor.

,, Put simply your outs are the total number of cards that will make your hand a winner; multiply this number by 4 on the turn to give you an idea of the percentage chance to win. Or times 2 on the river. Example you are open ended after the flop. So there are 8 cards that make your hand so 8X4 tells us that before the turn your chances are about 32% within about 2 percent or about 1 in 3. On the river your odds are 8X2 or 16% give or take 2 percent.

, If there are you and 4 other people in the pot, you are getting about 4 to 1 on your money. If you have a 1 in 3 chance to hit you are getting pot odds. This is the main key to money.

Don't quit your day job!,
Make a plan/schedule and stick to it.,
Control your bankroll efficiently.",How to Make a Living Playing Poker," This is one of the most common things you will hear poker players say because when the cards aren't going your way, you need to make sure you can still pay the bills. Figure out the minimum amount that you can work in order to just pay for the essentials. Another option for some people is investing, whether it's in stocks or whatever you like if you have the opportunity. This option is ideal for those of you wanting to dive into poker full time head first because it frees up your schedule so you can get more time at the tables.;
, It is very important that you treat poker as a job now. Take it seriously and don't veer off course. Force yourself to play between 4-6 days a week for at least 3 hours a day, rain or shine you need to be at that table (or computer).

, A good rule of thumb is that you should never bring more than 20% of your bankroll to the table. But that is for amateurs, you are moving up in the game and that has an inverse effect on how you manage your account. Since now that money is actually what you live on, you need to cut down on the percentage used at each session. You should cut your use down to 3%-5% at each session in the long run because you are playing more hours, so it evens itself out whilst still protecting you from total loss. Now this only applies to those of you who are very serious about making this change because you need to have a substantially large bankroll to make 3%-5% worth the trouble, but if your account isn't already large you shouldn't be considering this option anyway. Now since hopefully you listened to step 1 and didn't quit your job, you have to treat your bankroll as if it where a stock or a bond that you receive dividends from monthly. Since you are still receive a paycheck, what this does is it allows you to grow your bankroll and your bank account simultaneously. This is done by gradually adding a percentage of the profit from the months play into your bank account. At first it will be a small amount, because it doesn't need to be large since you are already paying your bills with your paycheck. This allows for maximum bankroll growth early on. Then gradually increase the percentage of the ""dividends"" going into your bank account. This will simultaneously allow you to cut back on the reliance of your weekly paycheck.

So, $80 goes into the main pot. That means that $240 ($80 X 3 players, what they are short)will go into the Side Pot. At this time the dealer should announce ""John is all-in for $20.

, Other times it is easiest to calculate how much they are short. The third scenario is to just match the chips (colors) and do no math. **Whatever is easiest for you is the best way.

, The next player is all-in and has $152. Third player has $400 and goes all-in. Now take $152 from each of them and put it into the Main Pot. Be sure to add in any blinds of $152 or less. Player #2 is actually $31 short of the big bet by the first player. If you can do this in your head then you know that there is $62 on the side pot. This is really about chips by the color. Often it is easiest to just make equal stacks, rather than do the math.

, Three or four players go all-in for odd amounts. Just leave all their chips in front of them. Pray. Pray that the guy with the most chips wins and takes everything. When paying out the pots start with the outside (most recent pot made) pot and work your way back to the Main Pot.

Shuffle the deck.,
Deal the cards to the players.,
Burn and turn the cards.,
Manage the pot.",How to Deal Poker1," Shuffling randomizes the deck in order to introduce chance to the game. Not shuffling the cards could allow some players to predict the cards that will come up later, which would give these players an unfair advantage. There are different ways to shuffle, but a poker shuffle will typically consist of two riffles, a box, another riffle, and a cut.A riffle refers to splitting the cards in half and mixing them together by placing the corners of the cards in each half against each other and letting the cards go so they intermix.A box means taking the top quarter of the deck and placing it on the table, then taking the next quarter of the deck and placing it on top of the first quarter, then repeating this with the rest of the cards.A cut refers to placing the deck on the table and having a player cut the deck in half. The bottom portion of the deck moves to the top.Look up deck shuffling tutorials on YouTube if you would like to learn different shuffling styles. Some styles, like the Hindu shuffle or the Table Riffle shuffle, are known for being more elegant than others.;
, There are two main styles of dealing: American and European. You can switch up your style according to your mood or to who the players are:American-style dealing involves holding the deck in one hand, pinching the front right corner of the card with the thumb and index finger, and flicking the wrist to throw the card to the player.
European-style dealing involves touching just the top of the card and sliding the card to the felt, then pushing the card, often with a spin, towards the player.

, If you’re playing a community card game like Texas Hold’em, you should burn - in other words discard - the card at the top of the deck. You should also turn the fourth of five cards dealt to the community. The players can then use this card to constitute their final hand., It is the responsibility of the dealer to verify how much players are betting and raising as well as to keep track of side pots. You can use an online side pot calculator on a site like PokerListings to facilitate the process. Read the hands of the players and push the pot towards the winner at the end of the game."

Determine the total amount of money in the pot.,
Divide by the amount you need to call.,
Pot odds are fixed; there is no actual calculation.",How to Calculate Pot and Hand Odds in Limit Hold 'Em Poker1," If you are playing pot limit or no limit poker, you should already know this number.;
, Pot odds are invariably a function of calling or folding, rather than betting. In the simplest terms, if the bet is $1 to you, and there is already $4 in the pot, your pot odds are 5:1.

, However, 'implied odds' should be added in for the most accurate picture. In the scenario above, although your pot odds are 5:1, if there are 2 other people in the hand 'behind' you that haven't acted yet, and they each have $1 in their hand, waiting for you to call so they can call (bad poker etiquette), your implied odds, for just this round of betting, instantly rise to 7:1, as an example. Implied odds are calculated, since they are basically imaginary, and encompass more than just the scenario above, which is vastly simplified; in the scenario above, if the second person waiting to call behind you instead raises, you have to start all over.

Know what your bet represents.,
Determine the strength of your hole cards prior to betting Pre-flop.,
Learn the several ways by which you can decide on when to bet in Texas hold'em poker:


You can place a medium bet in a way that others will contribute to the growing pot.,
Study when to bet in Texas hold'em poker for a favorable blind stealing.,
Learn when to bet in Texas hold'em poker for making the maximum out of your hand?",How to Bet in Texas Holdem," Every time you voluntarily lay money on the table in poker, you should have a very good reason to do so. If you are not sure you should be betting, you need to take a moment and consider what your bet represents. No matter what cards you have, the cards your opponents have are much more important. If you never see your own cards, but you could see the hand of your opponent, you would be very wealthy. Thus, your bet is made to represent the image of your hand you wish to portray.;
, The basic consideration in betting before the flop in Texas Hold'em is based on the strength of your hole cards.


Do you have a speculative hand? Then you are probably betting to get to the flop inexpensively while keeping several players in the pot.
If you have a strong wired pair, especially Jacks or better, you should be betting to thin the field. Your pair will stand up against a single lesser hand at a very high rate, so you want to take only one opponent (or possibly two) to the flop with you.

,
Place a very high bet in a way to make it more difficult or less likely for others to move to the flop, thereby cutting down the competition.
Place a bet with a wrong hand without a scope to just confuse your opponent in regard to the quality of the hand they hold and to cut down competition.

, Primarily, in a game where you happen to be a dealer and there is only the dealer and the blinds remaining to play, competing to steal such a pot is called blind stealing. With this game being positional, if you are a dealer you would be the last to act and you can take the pot of the blinds fold. A raise is going to make the blinds fold if they are in a medium position; however, if you are going to call, they may just check to see what comes up next. If you are in a dealer position and have a strong hand you can bet high and re-raise, contributing to some increase in the stakes. However, this is not a big way to get rich.

, When you are having a good hand to play in a short-handed game, your focus against your opponent should be to limit their pot odds towards what they are trying to draw. Maybe they are targeting a straight or flush and you have a better hand than them, but if they are going to make it your hand may get beaten, in such cases you need to bet strong attempting to scare your opponents into folding.

Practice often.,
Be professional.,
Be familiar with a variety of games.",How to Deal Poker2," Shuffling a deck, dealing the cards to players, and keeping track of the pot are skills that you gain by doing the actions repeatedly. Practice at home with a deck of cards prior to a game to improve your accuracy and sleight of hand.

, Gamblers are looking to have a good time, which, for the dealer, translates to maintaining a positive attitude, showing restraint and keeping quiet throughout the game, and answering or redirecting any questions that are raised. Poker dealers must have good communication and customer service skills. Communicating with the players and, if applicable, with the floor or casino staff is crucial to being a good, entertaining dealer., Poker is played hundreds of ways, so familiarize yourself with the rules of each game. The most popular variations are Texas Hold’em, the Five- and Seven-Card Studs, and the Five-Card Draw.

Monitor the “pre-flop” betting round.,
Deal a flop.,
Deal a single community card.,
Deal another community card.,
Call for the players to reveal their cards.",How to Deal Poker3," The player in the small blind should receive the first card. This will be the player to your immediate left; they should place a bet equivalent to half of that round’s full bet., Go around the table allowing every player to raise (by the amount of the big blind or more), call (match the current bet), or fold (give up for the round). Moving clockwise from the player in the small blind, bets will be made until every player has folded, put in their chips, or matched the amount of other players combined., After every player has paid a blind or made an ante, as required by the rules by which you are playing, deal three cards face down to each player, beginning with a player to your left and ending with yourself. A second betting round will follow.

, Texas Hold’em is a game in which the incomplete, hidden hand of players is combined with face-up cards that are shared. This first shared card is known as the turn. A third round of betting will ensue, moving clockwise from your left., This is known as the river. A fourth round of betting and a showdown will follow., The best 5-card hand that can be made from the 2 cards in a player’s hand and the 5 on the table is the winner.

Set the cards that were not dealt in the center of the table.,
Open the table for betting.,
Allow players to replace and discard cards.,
Re-open the table for betting.,
Instruct players to show their cards.",How to Deal Poker4," Begin by dealing 1 card face down to the player to your left and continuing around the table dealing cards 1 at a time until every player has 5 cards.This is a game in which players are dealt a full hand which remains hidden and is improved by replacing cards.

, Mark these with a chip or another item so that they are distinguishable from other cards.

, At this point, players should be holding the cards in their hands, being careful not to show them to other players.

, Players can discard as many cards as they like and replace them by drawing the same number of cards from the deck in the middle of the table. Each player should ultimately have 5 cards.

, If you played blinds, where only the two players to your left paid money before you dealt the cards, betting should begin from the player immediately to your left., This is the showdown. The player with the best 5-card hand wins the pot.

Divide the number of cards unseen by the number of ""outs"" that you have.,

There must be at least that many bets in the pot (i.e.",How to Calculate Pot and Hand Odds in Limit Hold 'Em Poker2," ""Outs"" are the cards remaining in the deck that will allow you to make a winning hand.

,, multiples of your bet) for a call.


Example: You have 2 hearts. Two more hearts fall on the flop. There are now 47 unseen cards. You have 9 outs (9 out of 13 unseen hearts remaining in the deck) to make your flush on the next card.
Divide 47 by 9 = 5.2
Subtract 1 = 4.2
There must be at least 4.2 bets in the pot for you to call a single bet.

"
"
After the flop determine the number of outs you have.

,
Multiply that number by 4.,
After the turn you multiply your outs by 2.",How to Calculate Pot and Hand Odds in Limit Hold 'Em Poker3,", That is your percentage of catching one of your outs.

,


Example: You have two hearts. Two more hearts fall on the flop, so you have 9 outs.
9 x 4 = 36, giving you 36% chance to hit your flush and your opponent a 64% chance to hold up and win with a pair.
64/36 is a little less than 2 to 1. Therefore, it would make sense to call bets slightly higher than half the pot size.
If another heart doesn't hit on the turn you are now 9 x 2 = 18%
18%/82% is a little worse than 5 to 1, meaning the bet has to be less than 20% of the pot.

"

Calculate the number of players remaining in the tourney.,
Determine the capacity of your tables (most poker tables seat eight to ten players).,
Divide the number of players by the number of tables, integer only, remember the remainder.,
Since there are more free seats than the size of a table, this is a perfect opportunity to break up the smallest table.

,
The director should announce that play will stop at the conclusion of the hand for re-seating.

,
Pause the blind timer.

,
Upon completion of any hands in play, tell the players to remain in their seats while a table is broken down.

,
The director should evaluate the needs of each remaining table.,
Using the notes outlining the needs of the other tables, the director should instruct each player at the breaking table which table and seat to assume.,
Once all the players are comfortably seated, announce ""Shuffle up and deal"" and restart the blind clock.

",How to Break Up a Table in a Poker Tournament,"


For this example, 28 remain of 40 starting players. Table 1 - 7 players, T2 - 8p, T3 - 6p, T4 - 7p.;
,


For this example, there are four 10-seat tables

,


28 players divided by 4 tables is 7. There are 12 open seats at all tables.

,,,,, It may be wise to use a pen and paper to jot notes.


Since table three has only six players, it should be the choice to break down.
The director should then inventory each of the other tables, noting what seats are available on the paper.
Each player should be moved into as similar a position as possible at their new table.

,


As play is suspended, there is no great rush to complete the move before another hand begins. The director should take whatever time necessary to ensure a smooth and fair transition.
The director should not place a new player in the small blind. If it is absolutely necessary, that player may not participate until the button has passed. The small blind is dead, and on the following hand the dealer will be dead as well.

Look at opponents noses, not into their eyes to seem less shifty-eyed.,
Bet without looking at the flop (preflop), taking a chance, in spite of weak hole cards, sometimes.,
Make it believable to everyone!,
Bluff when you would, most likely, not win otherwise.,
Make sure that if you have a nervous habit you're not doing it.,
Bluff and get caught with it pretty early for advertising purposes.,
Enhance the other players bets by taking down a pot, with opponents folding to your weak bluff -- and then showing your trash cards (once).,
On the turn when a high card appears or when a card that completes a flush or straight appears, bluff.,
Bluff when you have high cards that could win at the showdown without making a hand.,

,
In a tournament situation, where strategy calls for tight play, start tight then bluff.,
Play a bluff when you have been folding trash hands and your opponents could be expecting some good hands to come your way.

,
When on the button/you're turn dealing, or when last to act, the boards look terrible and your opponent has checked, try a bluff here.,
Calculate the value of your bluff into your overall expectation.",How to Bluff," It appears the same, but you'll probably have less tell-tale nervous eyes. You might wear a hoodie/silly hat and shades; so they can't see your ""tells"" as easily, when you're playing weak or strong, but trying to look consistent.;
, Do not bluff preflop too often. But, when you have been playing conservatively/tightly, and it seems like it is your turn to take down a pot -- it can seem real. Playing tight all the time is a form of tilting in their favor, so occasionally play your cards irrationally (for your own reason) and break out of the tight pattern (but don't ever say it's your turn, until you win). Bluffing is a big part of poker.

, Think it through before you say your bet, like what the consequences would be. Be consistent with the hand that you are representing by how you have played previously and think about what present hole cards connect on the board. Heads up, you have A♥J♣ and your opponent holds A♦Q♠ with a board of 2♣9♥7♦4♣,__, but you had raised preflop; so, your opponent would have put you in a range of high cards or a possibly a pair (but s/he has no reason to fear a flush or straight with the splits and rainbow board). Your opponent may call or raise your turn bet thinking that both the flop and turn would not make a hand with you probably holding high cards. You also, probably won't fold, naturally thinking, ""ace high is good,"" not knowing that only another J or drawing a Q can make your hand worth anything.

, Heads up, you have 7♥4♥ and the board is Q♥9♣6♥A♦,__ you will usually not get the heart on the river to make that heart flush draw, and you would lose the showdown with your two low cards and three big cards on the board. Even a seven or four, on the river, might not be enough to win. So what -- well, when the ace came on the turn, would be the time to bet representing an ace with a flush draw (the turn and river are like drawing, but everyone gets the same draw) like A♥x♥ and if your opponent folds more than 3 out of 10 times, your turn bet might be a win (so, note the tendencies of opponents.)

, Don't fiddle with your necklace, tap your foot, or blink too much. It makes you seem guilty.

, Act like you learned your lesson to not bluff; so, do not do this often. By giving action/bluffing, and revealing a weak hand once, then when you get a great hand later, you will get bluffing action back to build the pot, if they think you are weak/bluffing again. This is different from when you bet in the big blind (first player past the button) with some trash hand, they accept that. You get a ""free play"" when your hand connects with the flop and afterward, then at the showdown your opponents see your trash hold cards. Always look at the position, in relation to the button, that you and your opponents have.

, The other players could be irritated and spurred on to tilt after this and, so, put more money in the pot than necessary, trying to tempt you to ""Just try bluffing with trash again, buddy."" But now you should only bet if you're strong, and fold until you have good cards, to take to a river showdown. However, if you hadn't shown those weak cards, just discarded them after everyone folded, you could still seem scary/more real, and could play more bluffs, by not having stirred up the opponents.

, In each case, you would have to be paying attention to your opponent's play in the hand and prior to the hand to get a read on his hand.

, With high cards there is a possibility of making a top pair with more cards to come on the turn and river, and it would be no shame to go to showdown with high cards without a made hand.

,, Here, you are thinking beyond making the cut, and going for the final table. Trying this buying-in and paying to play each hand can be worthwhile because of the payout structure. Be ready for the rewards and consequences of losing, in this daring play.

,, But otherwise, bluff against fewer opponent rather than many opponents.

, Use this when drawing, for example, but the pot odds are not sufficient. The bluff adds to the overall expectation, because some of the time without your holding good cards, your opponent will fold when you bluff.

, Playing with Jimbo and Bubba from down the street and constantly beating them isn’t exactly the same as constantly beating tables of people in red-carpeted VIP rooms. To be sure you’re made of quality stuff, play when the going gets tough. Can you keep your cool?


Staying calm and logical is large part of poker. Sometimes even good players get nervous and end up doing something they'd regret. When you're familiar with intense competition, you get used to the anxiety and it (in part, at least) eventually dissipates.

, Your bankroll is the term used for how much money you need in your pocket to play the game. There are two varieties:Limit Poker bankroll. The most common number used for limit poker is 300 big bets. Determine what stakes you need to play to make the amount of money you are aiming for. Once that is done, anticipate an earn rate of one big bet an hour. Then, multiply the big bet times 300. If you are playing $10-$20, with a big bet of $40, it would result in an earn rate of (at 40 hours per week) $1,600, and you would need a bankroll of $12,000.

No-limit Poker bankroll. No-limit has no set standard. Let's start with a good rule of thumb, which is 20 to 25 maximum buy-ins. If you've decided you need to play in a $500 max buy-in game to profit, then you should have a $12,500 bankroll.

, Being a professional poker player doesn’t mean having your name in lights: it means playing poker as your job. You don’t need to travel circuits around the world to be a professional poker player – you just need to make it your main source of income. If you find a place or two you jive with, stick with those places. It’s your bread and butter.


You will likely develop a reputation for yourself if you stick to one or two places. People may start not wanting to play with you, or worse, recognizing your habits and strategy. If you sense this coming, you may have to widen your circuit and play unsuspecting strangers.

, If you’re lucky enough to be an amazing poker player who resides out of the USA, you can play online poker to pad your bankroll. Lots of people find this easier – it’s often quicker, pain-free, and, quite frankly, it’s easier to take money from the faceless.


If you do live in the USA, it’s possible, but it may not be legal. The US decreed a law recently banning banks from dealing with online poker companies. However, you can play for free online to practice – or you could hack into the system and get a foreign IP address, though that’s not at all recommended.

, That huge number you came up with in the last section? You need that to play seriously. You need that for buy-ins and betting, and for when lady luck isn’t on your side. Every time you win a game, have half of your hand go directly to your bankroll. If you’re playing often, you should have it in a few months’ time.


Don't be tempted to get into intense tournaments when you don't have it just yet. You may end up losing your earnings and having to start all the way back over. Be patient.

, Some people are just not smart about playing games of skill. They end up losing all their money on a hand they swore was going to be the big winner. They go home penniless, having to beg their friends for favors. Don’t let that be you! Have some money saved up for a rainy day in case you become a little too addicted to the game and happen upon an unfortunate losing streak.


If you sense this happening, get help immediately. A gambling addiction can ruin your life, in addition to family members' and loved ones'. Talk about your problem or call a help hotline if need be.

, So you’ve graduated from Jimbo and Bubba, you played in the big tournaments in a few of your local casinos and did well, but then you went off to Vegas and got your shirt handed to you? Swallow your pride and back up. Hone your game, and then try again. There's no shame in it.


Think of this as an opportunity to grow. Where did you mess up? What could you have done better in? Instead of letting this damage your ego, take it as a sign showing you how you can improve.

, A regular poker game at your local casino is all well and good, but to make some serous dough, you need large cash games and tournaments. Visit a few of the biggest regional casinos in your area and hit up local poker organizations for money-making opportunities.


Big tournaments (like World Poker Tour) have $10,000 buy-ins. This kind of step is reserved for those with a chunk of change to spare. Make sure you're financially stable before you take a leap like this.

, Poker has a long history of greats and experts whose combined knowledge is just waiting to be tapped into. Read books, watch videos, take classes. Find inspiration in those who have done it to show you that you can do it, too.


Start out with Phil Gordon's 'Little Green Book' or 'Super System II' by Doyle Brunson. You find that there's aspects of the game you haven't even thought about.
Some poker websites are scams, trying to take your money to give you material that you won't find helpful, especially if you're already quite good. Do your research before purchasing anything to know if you're getting something legitimate.
If you know a few poker players who could teach you something, tap into your resources. Having a poker coach (even when you're quite good) can drastically change your game for the better. You'll get the benefit of learning something and they'll get the benefit of teaching someone something they care so much about. It's a win-win.

, As you start schooling at your local casinos and card rooms, seek out bigger and bigger tournaments to be a part of. Always take baby steps, though, and be realistic about your money situation and your skill. In this realm, slow and steady wins the race.


By now you likely have hundreds of connections that can keep you filled in on the poker world. Do research online, sign up for newsletters, and keep in contact with people who are often part of tournaments and games you're interested in.

, Once you make enough to live on and know that you can keep it up, it's time to quit that 9-5. But remember: now you have to play poker. It's your sole means. The stakes for you are higher than ever. Hey, maybe it'll improve your game.


Try to take other opportunities that come with being a pro, like teaching, writing a book, or starting a website. This way poker is your life, but it doesn't depend on you playing 40 hours a week and always winning. Life, even as a professional poker player, can be stressful.

If you are playing American Bingo: Your goal is to cover five squares in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row. Cards in the US are 5 rows by 5 rows with a letter from the word BINGO written above each vertical row. The numbers on each square are generated at random. There are 75 balls with either a B, I, N, G, or O on them as well as a number. These letter-number combinations should occasionally coordinate with a square on your card.If you are playing British or Australian Bingo: Your goal is to fill one, two, or all three of the lines on your card. These cards are 3 squares by 9 squares. Each square has a number in it and are generated randomly. There are 90 balls with numbers on each that can be selected by the caller. The amount of money or prizes you win varies by how many of the horizontal rows you can fill. These cards are sold in “books” or “flyers”. Each book contains 10 bingo cards. Each card has its own unique color.

, If you are playing in a hall, a caller will have already been chosen. The caller is the person who selects balls that have numbers and letters written on them. He or she calls the number-letter combination out to the players.

, Each player should have at least one card. You can also play with multiple cards at a time. While this is harder than just playing with one card, it increases the chances that you will win. Making sure everyone has the same amount of chips is not necessary because you can always take more chips.

, This is your easiest placement as it is free and does not require a number to be called for you to cover it. For US players, the free space is generally located in the center of the card.

, You can purchase a spinner from a toy or game store. To save money, you can also place all of the balls in a bucket and mix them around. The caller should select a ball without looking at the bucket.

Make sure that you call it immediately--Bingo must be claimed on the most-recent number called. If the caller has already called the next ball, or is in the process of doing so, it is too late to call Bingo., The caller should ask you to read the numbers you have marked. If you made a mistake and marked a square with a number that wasn’t called, your win will be void.

Shuffle before dealing the cards.,

Cut the deck onto the 'cut card' and get ready to deal.








,
After the blinds are posted, deal each player two cards face down.,
Note: There will be four betting rounds.,
Round 1 (Preflop): Betting starts with the player clockwise of the Big Blind.,
Round 2 (The Flop): The dealer takes the top card from the deck and ""burns"" it, face down, under the pot.,
Round 3 (The Turn): The dealer once again burns a card and places another card face up on the table.,
Round 4 (The River): The dealer burns a card again and places the fifth and final card face up on the table.,
The Showdown: After betting/checking on the river, any players left in the pot have to either show their hands or fold them.,
Whoever has the best hand wins the pot.",How to Shuffle and Deal Texas Holdem," The first thing a professional dealer would do is fan out the deck and inspect the cards to see they are all there. Next turn the deck face down and mix them up. You are also checking to see that all the cards are the same color on the back. Now push them together and shuffle the cards.






;
, Hold the deck in one hand. Use your other hand to take off the top 1/3 of cards and set them on the table. Then take the middle section and place it on top. Finally set the bottom third on top of the others. Then shuffle the cards normally again.








,, Start with the person clockwise of the dealer button, and deal one card at a time around the circle, until every player has two cards., During each round, move all folded cards into a ""muck pile"" under the hand in which you hold the deck (the ""stub""). When each round is complete, the dealer moves all the chips in to a pile at the center/right (or left, if the dealer holds the stub in the right hand) of the table. (The ""pot"") Betting always begins with the player seated clockwise of the dealer, and continues until all players have either folded or called the total bet, including all raises.








, Each player must either: 1. call the amount of the Big Blind as a minimum, 2: fold their hand, or 3: raise the bet, in accordance with predetermined table rules.

Play strategically when it comes to big blind.,
Keep it small in the early stages - and learn about your opponents.,
Take it up a notch in the middle stages.,
Play ""the bubble"".,
Avoid missteps in the ""late stages."",
Tackle the final table aggressively.",How to Be a Good Tournament Poker Player," Knowing how many big blinds you have in a poker tournament plays a huge role. When you start a poker tournament you can usually expect to start with anywhere from 100 to 200 big blinds. The more big blinds you have the better since you have more flexibility to bet, raise, check, or fold. But, if you have 10 big blinds you don't really have any flexibility and your best options would be folding or going all in.;
, When playing the early stages of a poker tournament it's important to play tight. The pots will be very small compared to the chip stacks so play solid hands and just try to pick up some small pots.


This is also a good time to figure out how the other players play. Some players might be playing every hand while another player might like to bluff a lot. If you can figure out the playing styles of your opponents early on it will help you later in the tournament.

, During the middle stages the blinds increase, antes are added, and chip stack sizes play a big role. In the middle stages you want to start taking more chances to try to accumulate chips. This is why knowing how your opponent plays and their flaws is so important. If they play tight then you can bet and win pots off them. If they play aggressive you try to can trap them with a big made hand. If they bluff a lot you can call with a weaker hand or raise you opponent off their hand.

, The bubble is when the tournament gets down to the last few players before making the money. This is the best time to try to steal the blinds and antes and increase you chip stack for the late stages of the tournament. There will be players so focused about trying to ""make the money"" and not busting the tournament that they will fold every hand to just try to win their money back.

, It's important to make no mistakes. At this stage, any move that you make could make you or break you. Play strong cards and play them aggressively. Think every decision out very carefully and ask yourself why your making a specific play. Don't raise with weak cards because if you have a lot of short stacks at your table they could move all in and force you to make a bad call.

, When playing a poker tournament, making the final table should be your realistic goal. If your able to make the final table you can then be looking to set yourself up for the win. The final table is a lot like playing the ""later stages"" of the tournament and playing ""the bubble"" at the same time. Since the payouts between the first person at busts the final table and the first place finisher are huge, players are more likely to try to wait for other players to bust so they can move up in the money. This means you should be playing a tight and aggressive style. Applying pressure is important. Also look for opportunities to pick up blinds and antes.

Get set up.,
After you've dealt out the cards to the players, get another deck of cards, and lay them in front of you.

,
When you're ready to start, have the players lay all of their cards face up, as the caller slowly looks at the card in the full deck and names the number and suit.,
Once a person gets all of their cards face down, they call ""Bingo!""",How to Play Card Bingo," Depending on how many players you have, deal out your cards.


If you have six players, deal out eight cards each, leaving four cards left over.
If you have seven players, deal out seven cards each, leaving three cards left over.
If you have eight players, deal out six cards each, leaving three cards left over.
If you have nine players, deal out five cards each, leaving seven left over.
If you have ten players, deal out five cards each, leaving two left over.;
,,


Example: Caller calls out ""Jack of Diamonds"" - One person should say ""Got it"", turn over the Jack so it's face down, and the caller moves on to the next card.

If you are not playing for money, still the bank should divvy out an equal number of chips to each player. There are a couple ways to organize your game from here.


""No limit buy-in, winner takes all"". In this version, each player buys into the game with a set amount—perhaps $5 for a friendly game, hundreds or more for serious wagering. There is no limit on how many of their chips a player can bet at once—you can go ""all in""—but when a player runs out he or she is out of the game unless allowed to buy back in for another share of chips just as new players can buy-in during the first 2 or 3 days of the tournament with hundreds playing, coming and going. In these tournaments players are usually eliminated one by one by leaving it all on the table until the last remaining player wins the whole pot. But, in some large tournaments, the last 10, 20,30,... or 100 to go out get an increasing take-home, up to the ultimate winner's set pay amount (not the amount of the table pot).
""Limit, No Buy-in"". In these games betting at each stage of the hand is not allowed to go all in, and also players can usually buy more chips at any time. This means that instead of playing the original chips until eliminated, players can wager until they are no longer willing to put up more money. Often, a player can ""cash out"" of the game to take their winnings or cut the losses at any time.
;
, Sponsor can deal a card to each player to see who has high card to get to deal first. Give this person a token, called ""The Button,"" and a clean, standard deck of 52 playing cards (no joker, no wild card). The dealer shuffles the cards and always deals to his or her left, clockwise around the table to the button last. After each hand the button is passed to the left, and the job of dealing thus rotates around the table.

, Have every player prime the pot—a small amount of money for the table/pot before dealing any cards. Using an ante is optional, but it keeps the pot motivating for everyone to try and makes sure pot size doesn't depend only upon the money wagered.

, The player to the left of the dealer for each hand is the small blind and must first put in half the decided minimum bet. The next player to the left of the small blind is the big blind, who puts in the full minimum. These bets are called ""blinds"" because they are placed before any cards are seen/dealt.

, Hand them out one at a time, starting to the dealer's left and ending with the dealer/button. Players can look at their own cards and should keep them secure and facedown. These are the ""hole/hold"" or ""pocket"" cards, and each player hopes their pair combines best with the community cards. Players are responsible for keeping their hole cards secret. If a player's hole cards are accidentally exposed or are mucked/folded, that player forfeits claims to any money already paid into the pot for that round.

, If they had to put in the ante, then each player can ""check/tap"", until someone ""raises the ante"" which then must be at least called. The betting round begins in earnest with the player to the left of the big blind, called the ""action/under the gun"" position. Starting with the player to the left of the big blind, each player must call (meet) or raise (increase) the current stakes to stay in the hand. If a player chooses to bet or raise, the next player must meet (""call"") or raise that new bet, and so on. Raises must often be in increments of the minimum (big blind) bet. If a player does not wish to call or raise the current bet, he may fold by pushing his hold cards to the dealer into the muck/discards, quitting the pot and sitting out the rest of the hand. Betting goes around the table clockwise until every player has either folded or called or re-raised. If one player makes a bet none of the remaining players are willing to at least match, the hand ends and that player wins the pot without a showdown. He may muck his hand or choose to show either one or both of his hole cards (showing one or both cards when at least one is pretty good is a way of establishing or helping your reputation, ""see, I play when I have good cards, see this ?"").


When betting circles the table and returns to the small and big blind players, these players subtract the money they've already put in from the current call. Thus if no player had bet more than the minimum, the big blind has the ""option"" to either raise or stay in the game at no additional cost by checking. The small blind owes 1/2 of the minimum plus the amount needed to buy up to the call. If the minimum were $100, then the small blinds needs to pay in $50 to pay-in the minimum to the pot.

, These are community cards that players still in the betting hope will combine favorably with their pocket cards.


Before dealing out the flop, or any subsequent cards, the dealer should discard, or ""burn,"" the top card of the deck face down to lessen the ease of the dealer slipping a card on top for cheating purposes.

, The flop is followed by a second round of betting, this time without counting any players as the ""blinds"". Just bet normally starting with the player to the button's/dealer's left. Players are betting on the total of the two cards they have face down in front of them and the three community cards face up in front of the dealer.


If no one has yet bet, players may ""check"" to pass without betting for now. If no one bets the game moves on, but if a bet is made as action goes around the table, then those that checked must bet/call the new stakes to stay in the hand.

, The turn is the fourth community card dealt already turned face up by the dealer. Now players evaluate their chances based on their best five-card combination of their two secret/hidden hole cards with some or all these four community cards—with the knowledge that there is yet one more community card to see that might improve their hand. But, players without a significant draw/combination at this point should probably check/fold unless they hope to bluff their opponent(s) to fold/rather than to bet more into the pot. The bet amount may make it too expensive to ""pay to see"" the possible bluffer's hole cards. Then no one else knows whether it was a bluff or not, unless the winner chooses to show one card as a tease or downer, or to even show he or she ""had real goods"", if it was not purely a bluff.

, Since the river is the last card, players bet based on the best five-card hand in these seven total cards—this hand will not improve, so check/fold now it you don't believe it is going to win, unless you hope to bluff your opponents out of the pot. Again, if one player makes a bet the remaining players aren't willing to match, he or she wins without having to reveal his cards.

, Assuming there are at least two players who haven't folded by the end of the last round of betting, the remaining players flip over their two pocket cards, starting with the last player to bet and going clockwise. A player who tried to bluff, got called, and knows he is beat may simply muck his hand and forfeit the pot. Each player announces his five card hand. The player with the highest hand wins the pot (the total sum of all chips bet on this hand).

, Hold'em poker usually continues until most of the players have been knocked out or quit and either a single winner has all the chips or the remaining players choose to split the pot proportional to how much each has won.

Use the amount of probable possibilities, in this case five.,
Look at the pot size and the amount of the bet to call.,
Call, or even raise, if the pot odds warrant a call and fold if not.

Always consider, the amount of players, the number of players remaining the the hand, the type of game, your opponent type, position, your outs and the number of chips you and your opponent have.

",How to Assign Equal Outcomes in Poker," The flop is A♦-2♠-6♠ and you fear you have a two outer Q♥-Q♣ . Fearing the worst, you put your opponent on a top pair and that he has an ace. Examine the board, and decide on the possible and probable outcomes simply. Decide that your opponent could have 1) top pair - aces, 2) flush draw, 3) straight draw, 4) middle pair such as K♣-6♥, or 5) he has nothing.;
, So, instead of fearing that your opponent has top pair, there are four other possibilities.

, Compare the pot odds with the number of possibilities.

Compare equally valued hands.",How to Play Texas Hold'em2," Poker is based on assigning ranked value to different combinations of cards. The hand with the rarest combination wins. Below are the different standard poker hands from lowest to highest.

, Not a made hand, so its value is based on the highest card, then the next highest, on down, comparing to other hands, and so it can tie/win when no one has a better hand. Two is the lowest and Ace is the highest.

, Two of the same value card. Example: 3(♠) - J(♣) - J(♥) - 2(♥) - 5(♦) is a pair of Jacks.

, Two groups of two of the same value card. Example: 4(♥) - 4(♦) - 9(♠) - 9(♣) - A(♠) is ""two pairs, 9's and 4's"", ""nines and fours up"".

, Three of the same value cards (a set). Example: 6(♣) - 6(♦) - 6(♠) - 3(♠) - J(♣) is three 6's, ""trip sixes"", ""a set of sixes"".

, Five cards running in order ""off suit"". Example: 5(♣) - 6(♠) - 7(♣) - 8(♦) - 9(♥) is the ""9-high-straight"".

, Five cards ""suited"" (all the same suit). Example: 5(♥) - 7(♥) - 9(♥) - J(♥) - Q(♥) is a ""queen-high-flush"".

, Three of a kind and a pair. Example: 7(♥) - 7(♣) - 7(♠) - Q(♥) - Q(♦) is ""full house 7's and queens"".

, 4 cards all with the same value. Example: J(♥) - J(♠) - J(♣) - J(♦) - 5(♣) is ""four jacks.""

, The highest possible hand in poker. All cards are suited (of the same suit). Example: 3(♥) - 4(♥) - 5(♥) - 6(♥) - 7(♥) is the ""7-high-straight-flush"".

, Example: 10(♣) - J(♣) - Q(♣) - K(♣) - A(♣) is the ""ace-high-straight-flush.""

, If you have two players at the showdown each with the same type of hand, the winner is determined by whose version is higher in number. Here's how this rule plays out:


A pair of 9's beats a pair of 4's.
Two pair, Jack's and 2's, beats two pair, 7's and 5's.
A straight that runs as high as Queen beats a straight that only runs up to 10.
An Ace-high-flush beats a King-high-flush.
If hands have combinations of the same value, the hand with the highest extra card wins. For example a pair of 8's with an Ace-high remainder (""kicker"") beats a pair of 8's with a 10-high. If both had the Ace kicker then you proceed to the next highest card in each hand. Kickers are very important in hold'em. If your opponent opened the pot with AK and you call with KQ, then a king comes on the flop, the pair of kings will likely make you bet higher, but now he has the Ace kicker...

"
"
Going ""all-in."",
Making side pots.,
Playing ""heads-up.""",How to Play Texas Hold'em3," If you are very confident your hand will win, or you believe no other player will be willing to match you, you can push all your chips on the line—a bold move.

In a tournament, if ""you're down to only 5 more big blinds/antes"" then you'll be out after 5 rounds around the table if you don't make a stand, so you will want to go all-in pre-flop with a reasonably good hand, hoping to double up or get everyone to fold. If you have only 5 times the blinds and antes, just picking up the blinds and antes means a 20 percent increase for you, which is huge. So, for example, if you have any pair, any ace, any king, or any two face cards, strongly consider going all-in pre-flop -- if no one has yet entered the pot.
You are ""short-stacked"" compared to other players and to the blinds/antes. If making any reasonably sized bet will put half or more of your stack into the pot, you are pot-committed and may as well go all-in to look stronger and apply maximum pressure. Even if you have the nuts (the best possible flop with your hold cards), don't try to slow-bet and raise just the minimum if you are already pot-committed. Any opponent with the slightest bit of observation will become suspicious why you did not simply go all-in, if you are strong. In any case, your opponents are likely to interpret an all-in from a short stack as a desperate move and call if any of them have a reasonably good hand.
If you have enough more chips than an opponent who has a wager on the table, you may ""put him or her all in"" by betting equal to their total chips (you can say ""all-in""). If no other player calls and the shorter stack doesn't fold, both reveal their cards in the showdown -- then any remaining community cards are dealt out one by one without any more wagering on each (because the all-in player has no more chips to bet with). If the other person wins you double that player up, but you have a chance to send that player home.







, If one player is all in, players who call that and still have more chips can still make additional bets with each other. This is called a ""side pot."" Set aside one pot equal to the bets made up to each remaining player each calling the ""all-in."" This first match up is what the original all-in player can win. The remaining players can bet against each other into a separate pot, saying ""okay I'll raise you "". At the showdown the main pot goes to the player with the best hand, and the side pot (or pots) go to best hand amongst the players who contributed to that, and one ""or more"" go home, if the wagers put you and/or others all-in as well.


If you have a reasonably good hand, say AQ, and a short-stack in front of you has pushed all-in, probably as a semi-/pure-bluff, you could also raise all-in yourself as an isolation play, as few players will call a raise and a re-raise in front of them without a very good hand like QQ or better. Your move will help you isolate the short-stack who likely would make the all-in with a weaker hand than you have.
If one player is already all-in and there is no money in the side pot yet, be inclined to just check unless your hand improves, because without any side pot money to play for, it doesn't make sense to try to bluff out others and increase the odds of winning for the all-in player. Checking the hand down maximizes the probability of eliminating the short-stack who is already all-in. This is known as cooperation play.

, The order of betting is slightly different when playing with only one other player, ""one-on-one"". The player with the dealer button posts the small blind and his or her opponent is the big blind. Then they alternate, getting the button, so the new small blind (button) is the first to wager in the betting rounds for each new hand. Preflop hand requirement is a lot less stringent. Almost any two cards is worth playing, and an ace is a monster.

Manage your bankroll.",How to Play Texas Hold'em4," Bluffing involves pretending your cards are better than they are, but don't say what your cards are, and making aggressive bets to force out all the other players—thus winning the pot with a poor or mediocre hand. Bluffing is risky, however, since you never know when an opponent might have a strong enough hand to call you all the way to the showdown.

, If you have a draw to a likely winning hand, say you have AK of spades and there are also two spades on the board, you may want to bet or raise and draw to a flush/made hand. Semi-bluff tends to be a higher percentage play than a pure bluff, by giving you two or more ways to win the pot. (1) Your opponents may fold to your bet on the flop, or (2) they may call but you could bet again to win on the turn card (although this may not fold anyone, seeming like a continuation bet) or (3) you actually hit your draw on the turn or the river and bet again (that's costly, but not as sudden/big as all in)., If you flop a monster/the nuts (the best possible flop with your hold cards) or at least trips, just check and call any bets to induce a bluff since you seem weak, or on the bad side, you may let your opponents catch a card on the turn or river. Slow-playing works best with loose aggressive players that you hope will try to bluff when no one has bet/as if they have nothing. If you flop a full house and bet out, everyone folds and you only win a small pot. So just check and let others lead out, as you try to catch a card on 4th or 5th street. Be careful, though, that you don't slow-play and get many opponents checking to see draws. For example, if you hold T(♥) - T(♠), and the flop comes T(♣) - 9(♦) - 3(♣) for ""trips T's"", and you now have three or more opponents in the pot. Do not slow play your set/trips, especially if you raised pre-flop and are known to make continuation bets. Bet ""a third of the pot"" to make the flush draws and straight draws fold or pay to see the next card., Psyche the other players, within the rules of a tournament. Keep quizzing earlier position players face up and theorizing about their hand while betting against them, without violating rules. Bragging about hitting the nuts, coconuts, monkey nuts is silly but boggles their minds. Over-talk, over-analyze how you might bet, how they may be ""strategizing"", what they hold -- while watching the reactions of each of the betters who are in the pot ahead of you.

Remark without delaying play when one loses to you on a showdown, ""how could you bet on Jack, ten?"" and stuff like, ""Why would you waste your time and money on Queen-high, awe, oh man..."" Don't expect answers, but don't interfere with actual play. Ask about any sort of legitimate issue. Ask about every aspect of their game only as you face each person, on each and every round, as you are apparently deciding how much to bet or whether to fold. Especially against shorter stacks, never-ending but seemingly sensible questions while you decide. ""You want me to bet? Or, do you want me to fold?"" so then ""If you want we to bet, I might have to fold. Honestly, what do you want -- me to do, fold? Yeah, fold? Fold right..."" Then your opponent folds with a much better hand, than you... and you only show your low card. Steam will come out of the folder's ears. You put your opponent on tilt.
Take ""forever"" to fold, being careful, then say, ""I think you got the nuts, right? So, you have queen or better, okay, I fold."" If that feels right, and you are not already all-in... ""Every time you play your hand the way you would, if you could see your opponents' cards, you gain, and every time your opponents play their cards differently from the way they would play them, if they could see your cards, you gain."" , per David Sklansky author, considered an expert on gambling. Which is like ""Play to 'what the opponent most likely holds from their time/position/size of bet and based on past pattern of play,' and get the other to play to 'whatever you suggest that you have and know what they have by your chatter and leading questions while you were deciding how to bet.' "" -- then the opponent quite often folds the better hand because you've put so many confusing/spinning thoughts in his/her mind (tilt!).

, Don't expect many answers. Ask for various counts: ""So, how much is your stack?"" ""I may just put you all in!"" ""I'll show you my hand at the end, okay."" then say ""if you show me yours, I'll show you mine""... ""Do want me to count my stack; well, (taking some time) I have about ___."" Be serious, ""I need to know ____"" asking ""how much is in the pot?"", ""how much is the current bet"""", etc. -- anything theoretically worth knowing. As if you don't know. ""Hey, so you have a bottom pair. No, it's top pair."" ""Now, I think you're on a queen... Yeah, yeah, you do have a face card. You do, right?"" You can say such guesses, and ask about your guess, about their hold; now, change your mind; guess again, etc. Get the table hot, angry or exasperated, so they may over-bet on weak hands to try to get back at you. But they end up folding or losing hands, stuttering, muttering and confused.

Tone it down to be less hated. Don't talk while they are deciding what to bet or to fold. Be, ""Mr. Nice Guy"" in words. Say, ""Nice hand!"" even if you win it. Say, ""good player, nice round"", but not letting up on the quiz.

, If you have a reasonably good hand, but not a monster (in early position like the one under the gun or the next player), say you have top pair (paired the top card on the board), and top kicker (strong kicker) after the flop, you probably have the best hand. You could bet out in front, but everyone might fold and you don't win more money than what's already in the pot pre-flop. Alternatively, check early, and hope that someone else bets later so you can see who has something. Then when it comes back to you to make the call, raise instead! Now if your opponent bet with something like middle pair, he will likely fold here and you win an extra bet. If you get called or re-raised, you need to consider folding if facing a tight-player. When you don't have a hand, the check-raise bluff works best against a weak tight player (playing weak). The check-raise bluff is a high risk play because you may seem weak and not scare the opponent, so you probably want to have seen that opponent fold to someone's raise before you attempt this ploy against him especially with a draw or weak made hand., Poker isn't just a game of chance—it's a game of psychology. Watch your opponents carefully for ""tells""—involuntary ticks of body language that reveal when a player is either bluffing/or holding a good hand. Also learn your opponent's attitudes and habits. You don't want to try to bluff against someone who will call every time; on the other hand, you don't want to slow-play someone who only bets with the nuts.

, If you have a hand you are positive is going to win, you want to get other players to bet as much as possible. To do this, don't bet too aggressively but slow-play it. Thus, make your raises incrementally to string the other players along. Don't go all-in; let your opponent go all-in.

, Poker is also a game of statistics. If you can, calculate the chances that the next card or cards will be one of the ""outs"" that makes your weak hand a winning one—or that makes your opponent's potential hand one that beats yours. A good rule of thumb is that the probability of catching your draw with two cards to come is equal to 4 times the number of outs, minus the number of outs in excess of eight. For example, if you have 9 outs (e.g. flush draw on the flop), you have 4*9-(9-8)=37% chance of making your hand, or slightly better than 2:1 odds against. So if you are offered 2:1 odds or better, you should call; otherwise, fold. Don't bet when the odds are far against you like you need to draw two running cards, or draw to inside straight, or on a showdown where you need only one certain card on the river.

, If your pocket cards are notably bad (2-7 off suit is considered the worst hand) or if you have no notable combinations after the flop, just fold immediately if drawing dead on the flop. Realistically you should only be playing about one hand in four, and the more players in the game the more conservatively you should play. If you've seen a poker game on TV, it can seem like the pros are playing every hand, but that's the magic of television—they may not show several hands where all or a vast majority of players fold immediately. At a full table, many players will fold immediately (without even seeing the flop) unless they have a pair, suited-connectors, or AJ or better as reasons to see the flop.

, For serious poker players, keeping a well-tended bankroll allows you to survive the ups and downs of the game without going broke. Start your poker session with a specific bankroll and decide how much you are willing to lose. It is recommended in Texas Hold'em to have a bankroll of 10 times the buy in amount for a game.

, Using the standard 4-suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades in no order or rank of suits), 52-card deck with or without jokers/wild-cards, etc. -- so there are many variations of games agreed upon before the first card is dealt, and complicates the game. For example, the ace normally plays high, but you can sometimes agree: on both ""aces high and low"" to make a hand (to be used as either the highest or the ""one-card"" in your hand, otherwise 2 is the low card). A joker or other wild card(s) may be agreed upon. A single hand can have several rounds of betting, until there are no options, also all have checked/no one betting.

At the end of each hand there can be a showdown, if more than one has not-folded/-discarded nor mucked cards, if so then those players still remaining but all have bet or checked, in that one hand compare their cards according to the hand rankings and card values (explained below). ""Suited"" cards (all suits are equal) are not used to break ties -- but in a tie -- if all 5 cards are of one, same suit (a flush) that beats the same cards in an ""unsuited"" hand, nor are cards used beyond the fifth card (don't draw to break a tie); only the best five cards in each hand are used in the comparison (your 2 hold-cards plus the best 3 of the five community cards on the table in Texas Hold'em make your hand). In the case of a tie, the pot is split equally among the ""tied-winning-hands"".






Wild cards introduce an additional hand, the ""five of a kind,"" which normally ranks after the ""straight flush"" and above the Royal Flush (""ace-high straight-flush""). Jokers may be eliminated as they are in Texas Hold'em. When a joker is in play, it usually can only be used as (1) an ace or for (2) completing a straight or flush as needed. So, it is not used as a true wild card for creating other hands.

, Become familiar with the names and meanings of poker hands and their variations by value of cards that form it (like a pair of Ks beats a pair of Qs or lower). The person who wins is the person with the highest-valued hand. You can't win, if you don't know and say in a timely manner that your hand beats the other to take the pot. If two players have hands with the same name (e.g. two ""full houses"" ) -- or no one has an named-hand -- then the player with the highest differing value card in ones hand wins (Ace is normally the highest ).

, Place the ""ante"" (pronounced ant-ee), the agreed ""token bet"", ""pay to play,"" to prime the ""pot"" for each hand (usually the pot is at the center of the table, although you can use a container/pot, if you wish), using whatever your agreed currency (poker chips, coins, bills, items of agreed value,...). If it is not a cash game, then there is a banker who sells the chips and keeps the cash safe to pay the winner. Agree on:

""No limit. Buy-in"" -- You start by buying equal chips. You can not buy more chips later. Winner ""takes it all"" and you can ""go all-in""/""risk it all"" (no limit to your size of bet, up to your whole stack). ""No"", you can not cash-out chips to ""take your winnings"" nor to ""cut your losses"". Players continue until each one ""leaves it all on the table"" and finally the last one with chips wins it all.
""Limit. No buy-in"" -- Limiting-bets means: no one can ""go all-in"" but you can start with unequal chips (start with short stacks against big stacks), then ""yes"" players also can buy more-/or cash-out-chips at any time to ""take your winnings"" or to ""cut your losses"".







, Then after each hand the Dealer/Button (last) position passes to the next player to the left. But, if the dealer is the same person at-all-times, then only the button position passes (instead of the dealer position). After shuffling (""showing off""), the dealer distributes the cards face down, starting with the player to his or her/or the button's immediate left and continuing clockwise -- one card at a time until everyone has five cards -- the dealer if playing/or the button is last to be dealt a card in turn for dealing each card. The remaining deck becomes the ""draw-pool"" (off the top) and is placed face down in the middle of the table.

, Keep them ""close to the vest""/secret (if you muck/ or reveal your cards, before the end of the hand, you are out of that hand). No one has to show cards if there is not a showdown unless ""show-one card"" is agreed upon. Some people like to put them in order while looking at them, to remember them more easily. This is the time to evaluate how strong your hand is.

Tells: Players often show the strength of their hand with an involuntary ""tell""/signs. Some tells include if only for a moment or two: shallow breathing, gasping/sighing, nostrils flaring, changing amount of talk or movements, lack of eye contact or more than usual eying others, facial muscle flexes (to relax for covering-up a smile or frown), neck tension, flushing red, eye watering, blinking, tonguing/licking, swallowing more, smacking, rapid pulse seen in the neck or temple, etc. Successfully deducing/catching these will give you a better chance to know who seems thrilled or disappointed when reacting to cards, or to others' words or bets.

, Some players wear large sunshades, a hat pulled low, a neck scarf to cover flushing or muscle tension, and try to have deadpan facial expressions and breathe evenly to conceal reactionary breathing.

, The person to get to start the round is usually the player on the dealer's/button's left (or the person who was dealt the first card), progressing clockwise/to the left. The player-on the spot to act first can decide to:



Open - Place the first bet. Or, ""check"" (no bet) and so pass the chance to open to the next player. If everyone checks, then it is time to draw replacement cards (explained below). But, once the pot is opened, by a bet (e.g. placing a nickel in the pot), then all of the players, including those who already had their turns have three new options, at their next turn:

Fold - Quit the game by pushing your cards face-down on the table toward the discards, to avoid putting more into the pot; whatever you have put in the pot ""stays in the pot"".

See/call - Stay in the game by betting the current-/running-amount (match it) into the pot. To call and pay in the current amount as previously bet going around the table. After they've made their choices in the first round, everyone who hasn't folded may still have those options again plus whatever else comes next, in progress of the game.

Check - Means ""I'm staying with the bets already paid into the pot in this hand by myself in the previous round and/or earlier in this round, and not paying more right now, until someone raises in their turn"", and you have to match it or fold your hand.

Raise - Betting and ""sweetening the pot"" instead of merely ""calling"", by putting in more than the last person put in the pot (to get the others after your position to pay-in that much or more, going around the table, or to fold and wait for the next round of this game). ""After the open, call or a raise"", all players still in the hand will have their turn in order to decide whether to (1) call (match and pay that same amount into the pot) or (2) fold, then the next person has his or her turn with the same options.

, Once everyone has had a turn and the first round completed with no raise to match (or if everyone checked) get rid of up to three cards (turned face down onto the table and pushed toward the middle), or keep them all. Discard ones you don't think will help, and have them replaced by the dealer, clockwise in turn. Be sure no one can see what you had/have (you can not get a card back, if a drawn card is unwanted).

, As before, the first player can either open/bet or check, and the checking can continue until someone opens, after which players can see/call, raise or fold. Players will start folding once they realize their weak hand isn't worth the additional bet.

, Everyone who has not folded turns their cards over to see who has the winning hand. Winner takes all, unless there is an absolute tie, then split the pot.

, Learn the ""Texas-rules"" (Texas Hold’em). Each player will be dealt 2 secret cards (called your ""hold"" or ""hole"" cards). Then 5 shared community ""draw"" cards will be in 3 stages be placed on the middle of the table in front of the dealer, for all to see -- dealt face up to make your hand. Players try to make the best 5-card hand possible out of their 7 cards, using at least one of your hold cards..

, Each player takes a turn being the dealer/or button, unless the house furnishes the dealer. If so, then the button-position is passed around the table to the left, clockwise. In Texas Hold’em, an amount called the ""blind"" (half the minimum bet), takes the place of the ante on each new hand, where the ""big blind-amount"" is the minimum bet for the present hand.

The dealer assures that 1/2 the minimum is paid into the pot by the player immediately to the left of the button-position. That person is called the ""small blind"" for the hand, and the next person toward the left who is the ""big blind"" pays the full minimum -- before the deal of the cards. The dealer then deals each player 2 cards face down, one at a time, starting with player to the left of the big blind position around to deal to the button and deals the blinds last. The other players besides the blinds can choose to fold rather than pay the blind-amount or call or raise to begin the wagering after looking at their 2 hold cards.
Neither blind gets to wager on their hold cards until the rest of the table get to decide and wager or fold going clockwise, and then it comes back around to the blinds to bet or fold after the button gets to decide on the hand or not.

, It is called playing the ""pre-flop"" round, betting on your hold cards if you like. Play begins with the first player to the left of the big blind. That player either ""calls"" and pays in the big blind (the minimum bet), or raises and pays the blind plus more, or folds/discards/mucks the hold cards face down pushing them toward the center of the table.

Play will continue around the table, with each player having to match the previous bet, raise, or fold. But, if no one raises the minimum, the big blind can check or raise before the next round.







, After the first round of pre-flop betting has been settled, the dealer deals the first 3 community cards placed face up on the board, called the ""flop"", as the first stage of the game. But first the dealer places the top card off the deck face-down (called the burn card, placed in the discards) by rule. Those next three cards from the top of the deck are displayed face-up, side-by-side, so you can all see them. Each player now has 2 cards in their ""hold"" (personal hand) and 3 community cards to consider to bet upon. This round of betting begins, starting with the player to the left of the dealer.

, After the second round of betting (the flop), again the dealer burns (discards) the top card and then deals the 4th card of the hand to the table display, called the 'turn"" or ""4th-street"". The remaining players bet again, starting with the player to the left of the dealer.

, After the third round (the turn) of betting, the dealer burns the next card and then reveals the 5th and final card of the hand called the ""river"" -- or ""5th-street"". Players bet on their hands as usual for the round, and the winner takes the pot. If a player bets, but the rest fold rather than risk more into the pot, then the winning/remaining player does not need to show his or her hand/hold, but may show either card or both for effect. As if to say, ""See, I play good cards; oh, but sometimes I bet to see whether I can get lucky.""

, When you’re starting your initial round of betting, it’s important to know whether or not the hand you have is worth playing. In Texas Hold’em, you have two cards to start, and you’ll need to decide if you should play them or fold.


Hands to raise: Pairs of tens, face cards or Aces are almost always a good hand to raise with. An Ace and a King or an Ace and a Queen are strong hands as well. If you have these hands, bet before the flop to raise the value of the pot.
Hands to call pre-flop: An Ace with a face card, or two consecutive face cards of a different suit are strong hands to call with. Two consecutive non-face or face cards of the same suit can work in your favor. Low pairs should call to see the flop to see you luck to make two pair, a high kicker, or a full house, but not raise (they give less value, less likely to win, on average than higher pairs).

, The key to being successful at poker is knowing when to fold your hand and accept a smaller loss, or when to hold onto it and risk a larger loss knowing that you have a good chance to win the pot. If the flop comes and you’re holding a hand that doesn’t play, check and fold. You don’t want to keep betting money at a hand that won’t win. If the flop comes and you have a strong hand, bet at it. This will force weaker hands out and raise the value of your pot.


If your hand could play if the right cards come up, then you’ll want to determine if it’s worth holding out for them. Calculating pot odds can go a long way towards helping you make these decisions.
Pot odds are calculated by determining the percentage chance that you have to draw the card you need. To calculate them, count the number of outs you have. These are cards that will improve your hand. Multiply the number of cards times two, then add 1 to get the percentage. For example, if there are 10 cards in the deck that could improve your hand, you have about a 21% (10 x 2 + 1) chance of getting a card you need.
Next, you’ll need to determine if it is worth betting. Calculate the pot+bet, which is the pot total plus the bet to call. So if the pot is $120, and the bet to call is $20, then the pot+bet is $140. Multiply your percentage of your outs with the pot+bet. In the previous example, a 21% chance with a pot+bet of $140 would look like 0.21 x 140 = 29.4. This means you should call bets lower than %29 of the pot, or around $40. Working out the pot odds is only a guideline and doesn’t take a lot of variables into account. Use it as a basis to judge the worthiness of a hand.

, Playing your opponent is arguably more important than playing your cards in poker. You have to be able to read what your opponent is doing, as well as trick them into not knowing your plan.


Don’t let emotions cloud your judgment. You will lose hands, it’s guaranteed. Don’t let setbacks affect your attitude and playstyle.
Change up your pace. If you’ve been playing your cards close, and not betting wildly, start bluffing a bit more. If you’ve been bluffing, go back to playing tighter. Switching often will keep opponents from being able to predict your actions and guess your cards.
Read your opponent. Adjust your playstyle to your opponents’. Look for players that are betting carelessly, and try to trap them. Learn to see the tells, which can give you an estimation of their hand. Some basic tells: a hand over the mouth is usually concealing a smile; shaking hands is nervous, but that could be a good nervous or bad nervous; if a player glances at his or her chips when the flop comes, they probably have a strong hand; if a mediocre player is staring at you, he or she is likely bluffing.

, Don’t get bogged down with systems, react to situations as they arise. Every poker situation is different because of the human factor.

, When you are learning, you should never invest more than what you would consider “fun” to lose. Don’t add to your bankroll after losing everything you’ve invested. Wait until you are comfortable losing that amount again.


When you start winning on a regular basis, adjust your bankroll to maximize your earning potential. The general rule of thumb is you should be able to afford to lose 200 bets at the highest limit. So if the limit is $5 bets, then your bankroll should be $1000.
Track your wins and losses. This will help you figure out if you are winning or losing in the long run. Also, depending on where you live, you may have to pay taxes on your gambling income.

, It is a common misconception that this is harder to get than any other set of 5 cards of one suit.

,: Q-K-A-2-3 is not a straight, there is actually a big gap). The straight can't wrap around the end of the suit to line up lowest to the highest numbers.

,,,, Can't contain a King and a Two in the same hand (e.g. J-Q-K-A-2).

,,,,



Straight poker - Five cards are dealt to each player with a round of betting after each. The best hand wins the pot.

5-card stud - This is similar to straight poker, where you are stuck with the cards that you are dealt except, in this variation, four of the cards are dealt face up for all to see. The person with the best hand wins the pot. The dealing goes as follows: One card is dealt face down (the hole card) to each person, then one card is dealt face up to each player and there is a round of betting; there are three subsequent rounds where another card is dealt face up to all who have not folded and this is followed by a round of bets. Once the final bet is made, the hole card is revealed and the person holding the best hand takes the pot.

7-card stud - Your goal is to make the best 5-card hand possible. In 7-card stud, players are given two face-down cards, then one up before the first round of betting. Another three rounds of one card face up go to each remaining player (who has not folded) with a round of betting after each dealing. The final card goes face-down followed by the final round of betting. In stud, the cards dealt face down are called ""hole cards.""

Lowball - The goal is to get the hand with the lowest value.

Omaha - Four pocket cards are dealt face down, betting ensues, and then five community cards are dealt face up. A player must make a winning hand using two of the pocket cards combined with the three community cards.

Pineapple - Dealt three hole cards, discard one before the flop, play like Texas Hold'em.

Crazy Pineapple - Dealt three hole cards, discard one after the flop, play like Texas Hold'em.

Cincinnati - Four hole cards and four community cards with four rounds of betting.

Dr. Pepper - Five card draw with 10s, 2s and 4s wild.

Keep bluffing under your hat: Maintain/conceal the bluff on a weak hand.",How to Bluff in Poker," Realize that casino poker can be ""no limit"" (NL) and have extreme risks. Also, you have to chip-in/pay to play, and the price goes up as the number of players dwindle in the tournament. But ""friendly"" poker can have the expected outcome go wrong and cause you to lose your stack, (to say nothing of ruining your credit, when borrowing to pay gambling debts) and possibly lose face/your-reputation! By betting money into a pot that you know you're not likely to win, you're taking big risks (and, if you fold your bet/wagered money stays in the pot). On the other hand, sometimes opportunity strikes and looks so winnable, and the other players so ""bluffable"", that it seems worth such risk. Have your limits, strategy and backdoor. It is worth understanding from the outset that bluffing is a lot less common than shown in movies; in most cases especially with a large table of players, you do need to have good cards because someone at the table will often want to play to a final showdown since someone will have good cards in that large pool of players.


In tournaments avoid bluffing someone with a shorter stack who will be looking to get more money by betting strongly/and even going all in -- and, also, you avoid deeper stacks that can afford to ""look you up"" (call your bet/bluff). Medium stacks are the ideal target because they are less desperate, and more likely to play conservatively and fold when you bluff strongly; so, you win more often there.

Bluff not only when it's worth doing so, but also when the stakes are high; bluffing works well in high stakes when you have a middle or better stack, and the pressure's on all the shorter stacks to catch up to the leaders or fizzle, and they may go for bust with a weak hand, hoping to bluff-out anyone with a medium or bigger stack!
Talented poker players acquire their skill from thousands upon thousands of hands of experience; such as playing for practice online. If you continue to play poker with discipline and an open mind, your chances of bluffing successfully should increase consistently. A good bluffer has a constant attitude, either a fun personality or a never changing poker-face, and ""makes the attitude seem real"".
The successful bluff is one where nobody knows you bluff, because all the opponents fold/give-up before the last chance to bet, and you win the pot by default. If there is a showdown (where you must show your cards), you will be shown-up as a bluffer, if you are seen betting big with a weak or trash hand. You normally only want to get into a showdown when you have pretty good cards, except getting caught once may be okay; so, be ready to use your backdoor (so fold), before the showdown when you have a weak/or trash hand!;
, ""Tells"" are important - they're the analyzing side of playing poker. Not only does a good knowledge of tells tell when someone else is bluffing, but knowing common signs of bluffing will help you to try to avoid your own unconscious giveaway signs. And listen to other's advice about when they say that they think you're bluffing; being consciously aware of your subconscious tells can be used to your advantage by acting ""bluff"" tells when you want someone to think you're bluffing, but you actually have a great hand!


Watch how chips are put down. They can be placed down gently, counted down, banged down, slid forward, etc. If a player bets his chips very strong and far away from himself, it can mean that subconsciously their chips are going away from them, like they might be bluffing. On the other hand, a person betting closer to themselves can subconsciously mean that the money is expected to be coming back to them.
Watch the body language. Look for eye twitches, lip movements, scratching, flaring nostrils, holding of breath, and hand movements (such as covering parts of the face, differently than usual). All of these things can indicate bluffing.
Shaking is considered to be a sign of strength, expecting to win a pot.
When your opponent acts really strong they are likely weak/and bluffing. Staring you down whilst you act, splashing the pot, or faking a big smile when a certain card hits are all common signs of bluffing.
Watch other players to learn the tells when they're bluffing. Learn good tricks from those who bluff well.

, Keen instincts and sharp intellect must be combined with the ability to show no inconsistent emotion, or reveal nothing other than casual, fun involvement in the game. Look carefully at the corner of your two hold cards slowly/casually, keeping them face down, where only you can possibly see. Don't spill any information; so, keep your face ""deadpan,"" and wear shades to have the eyes as expressionless as stone and restrain blinking and shifting nervously when you see your cards -- and when the community cards are dealt each time. Avoid expressing approval or disapproval as if seeing good/bad cards (act the same way all the time as part of your poker face) - this is crucial if you're playing face to face.


Consider using props/concealment. Cowboys in the Wild West used to use their hats to cover their faces. In the age of televised poker, novelty props such as crazy hats, spooky glasses, and fancy wear can turn a player's chosen image into a big business affiliated product.
A beard, neck scarf, hoodie and sunglasses can work to cover your face, and neck. Not only the face but the neck can show tension or relaxing, a change in the pattern of your breathing or blushing/flushing.

, If you bet pre-flop, you may seem to represent a pair or other good cards in your hold, and get players to commit or fold their hold cards. Then you can raise on the flop to press those who are still left to bet/commit or fold. If you are playing too loosely, trying to look strong, you can seem false/like you are bluffing. So, don't bet pre-flop very often or you won't look real.

, Your chances of successfully bluffing are greater with fewer opponents because you have fewer people to drive out of the pot. Bluffing one or two players is more profitable/workable than bluffing-out three or more players.

, Do not bet too much, and don't raise an already large bet. If you think someone else probably has a great hand, fold, and play another hand later, as a path of escape/concealment.

, Making a reasonable bet, as it goes around the table for everyone to either bet or fold, makes you seem real. Be seen holding good cards at showdown, win or lose, or occasionally turnover your good cards when people suggest they think that you win by bluffing. So, build a reputation of consistently betting good hands to make your opponents believe that you probably have another pretty good hand when you are betting moderately. So, they think that you are logically trying to get as many chips into the pot, out of their stacks as you can. It takes guts to carry out the consistent pattern to set up a few good bluffs, because you could be up against a better hand, but if it's done right it can work pretty often, with luck, and if you stay alert enough to know when to fold to save your stack.

, This one must be powerful and intimidating. When the opponent checks, and then it comes to you, you can place a large bet to get the opponent to call or fold. If a player bets in front of you, there are two things you can do. If s/he bets small, your making a significantly larger bet might push him/her to fold. However, if the opponent makes a large, bluff-like bet, your best chance to bluff would be to call (less risk) -- or go all in, especially if you have a lot more chips than the other player. Consider, it is better to push all-in by betting than by calling, since you want to look strong to have more impact. The best feeling in poker is deciding someone is bluffing and taking down a large pot with a bluff of your own, causing the first bluffer to fold, and no one ever knows whether either or both of you were bluffing.


The turn card is also very important. If you bet big on the turn when you've been betting moderately earlier, players can be more intimidated. If you think you've actually won the hand on the turn card, you may even want to just check, and then bet like crazy on the river. People are more likely to make/call a big bet, if you checked before, thinking you might be weak/bluffing. This works even better, if you've been (accidentally?) caught bluffing earlier.

, Though, doing nothing special is likely to win a hand when everything is going right. Still, experienced players, can win pretty often when nothing is going right by representing (as if) having the goods, by playing, but not by lying. If you are seen as being a consistent liar, people will ignore your bluff, and few (or no one) will be scared by your bluff. Play ""tight""/seeming real, conservative (not loose) most often, then go strong, convincingly at the opportune moment; so your opponent gets ""that sick, losing feeling"" -- believing you have another good hand, fearing and avoiding a big risk, and so they fold (that's how a bluff can work). No matter how much advice you've followed from this article, a sudden river (5th Street) bet will not tell a cohesive story on its own, to lead people to believe the suggestion you make.


For example: Let's say you raise pre-flop, and then bet hard again on a flop of 9-3-J. Your opponent might have thought you were representing a pocket pair (a pair in your hold) by the pre-flop bet -- and now think you probably have a pair of 9s or Jacks on the flop because you bet. But if instead, the turn brings a 3 and you bet again, your opponent could be scared that you are on trip 3s, if you hadn't raised pre-flop, only to turn around and bet hard on 3s, a ""bottom pair,"" on the flop. A savvy opponent, with a made hand, could simply call your bets/bluff and rake in the pot. Pay attention to the sequence of cards (to represent a possible straight), suite/color (a possible flush) on the flop and watch how the betting unfolds. Try to represent having a certain/specific hand by having an attitude, good reputation, and being consistent with your betting pattern.
Make a bluff when cards are dealt that will possibly have weakened your opponents hand. If your opponent has called on a J-7-2 flop and the turn brings a 7, then this is not a good time to bluff as any pair your opponent may hold will still be as strong as before but he probably doesn't have trip 7s. If instead of 7 the turn comes down a K, then it is not looking so good now because some one (maybe you) may have paired Ks on the flop; so they are more likely to fold Js or 7s, if you betted/bluffed as if you may now have a pair of Kings. Then if they fold, you take the pot without a showdown. But, if instead of K the turn were any lower number card, then their possible pair of J or 7 would still be looking pretty good to your opponent. And, if you bet after seeing a weak turn card, they won't likely fold, because of your playing on the weak turn card is not scary to anyone. You need to decide to fold, if your opponent raised here or for sure on the River, if you're cards are a weak or trash hand, to avoid being caught...

, After the river bets (and, oops!, opponentdidn't fold), don't show your ""iffy"" cards. Say, ""Let's see your winning cards,"" and when the winner turns over his cards, just chirp, ""You win!"" If he insists to see your hand, ""No, let's see you hand; I think you got it.""; you won't need to prove anything about your story.

You insist, ""You got it. You win"" They win by default, anyway, if you ""discard the cards face-down"" without showing how relatively weak or strong you were. Just, chuckle, and leave them guessing, trying to never show a shaky hand...
But, if you had a nice hand/not good enough. You could after moderate resistance, finally, show them, ""See, it was good, okay?"" That's fun and proves you are betting strong, maybe.

",How to Play Strip Poker," Make sure they are all consenting adults who actually want to play the game, rather than suggesting it once people have already gathered. Bringing it up spontaneously can leave some people feeling uncomfortable if they don't want to partake.


If your group is already flirty or comfortable with each other, consider just arranging a night of strip poker. Otherwise you may want to get your friends together and let the game happen organically.;
, Even confident adults can be a little squeamish about showing their bare essentials. Make sure the vibe is right before you start. A little bit of alcohol can help people overcome their inhibitions.

, Don't pressure or force anyone to participate who doesn't want to.


If someone does feel too shy, however, you don't necessarily have to kick them out if they are interested in staying to watch. They might change their minds after watching a few hands.

, Decide which of the versions strip-poker below you want to play, what different items of clothing are worth, and so on.


Consider deciding how far the game will go and when it will end. Some people might be happy to play until they are completely nude, but others might only feel comfortable stripping until they are in their underwear. Agree on the limits, as well as if and how players will stay in the game once they have run out of clothes to shed.

, If some of the girls are in dresses while the guys have socks, ties and belts, have players discard or add accessories until everyone is even. This is optional, but makes the game more fair.

, Poker is a popular game using a standard deck of playing cards in which players are dealt cards and wager on the strength of their hands. Make sure your friends know how to play and know how to rank the traditional poker hands: from high card through pairs, straights, flushes, a full-house, four-of-a-kind, straight flush and so on. There are several popular poker variations, but not all of them are great fits for strip poker. Here are the two traditional options:



Play five-card draw. Probably the easiest version for a casual game of strip poker. Each player is dealt five cards and gets to exchange one or more of those cards for an equal number off the top of the deck. They bet or fold before and after the exchange and the remaining player with the highest hand wins.

Play Texas Hold'em. Each player is dealt two face-down cards and looks to combine them with a pool of five gradually revealed community cards. There are several rounds of betting, and the remaining player who can make the best five-card hand wins.

, Unlike in normal poker, where you play to win chips or money, the nominal objective in strip poker is to keep your clothes on while the losing players remove their clothing one piece at a time.

, The game isn't fun if you can't enjoy losing as well as winning, so have fun with it! Maybe do a flirty dance when it comes time to remove a significant piece of clothing.

, This is the traditional end of the game. Once a winner is declared, let everyone have their clothes back—or keep playing in the nude for new stakes!


You can combine your game of strip poker with truth-or-dare. Let players who lose all their clothes keep playing with different penalties if they lose, such as having to answer a truth or do a dare. Just keep your dares within a realm everyone is comfortable with.

, This is the simplest—and fastest—way to play. Simply deal out cards and play out a hand of poker with no betting. At the end the player with the highest hand wins and everyone else is required to remove a piece of clothing.


Alternatively, have only the player with the lowest hand in each showdown strip. This is a slower version of the game, for a more extended evening of fun.
If you want, you can let players fold early in the hand—such as before the flop in Texas Hold'em—to avoid having to strip. However this obviously gives shy players the option to hardly participate at all, which can defeat the fun of the game.

, This version is a great way to reveal hidden crushes and flirtations within a group. Play out a hand as normal, and at the end the person with the highest hand gets to choose one person in the group to lose and article of clothing.


With this variation especially, make sure no one in your game is likely to get jealous or territorial. In a group of friends it can be fun to find out who wants who to show a little more skin, but not if the answer is going to make anyone upset.
Don't pick on any one person. Conspiring just to strip down one player completely, especially in a larger group, is less fun, and can feel uncomfortable and predatory to that person.

, Deal out hands and let players bet an item or items of clothing instead of chips, which must be matched by the same or equivalent item by anyone who wants to call. Players without good enough hands can fold. After the showdown, the players who stayed in and lost remove the clothes they wagered.

, Play a normal game of poker with chips or cash bets, but allow players who run low to trade in items of clothing to the bank or another player for a loan of chips. This is the version of the game that most resembles actual poker, with betting, bluffing and strategy. Playing this version


Different items of clothing can either all have the same value, or can increase in value the closer they put a player to being naked. For instance if socks are worth $10, a shirt might be worth $30, and an undergarment could be worth $60.
If a player trades in some clothing and later wins a large pot, you should decide whether he or she is allowed to buy back some of their clothes. Letting them buy back some modesty adds a further layer of strategy to the game, while having players stay stripped keeps the game moving.

, Strip poker is classically a group activity, but you can adapt it into a fun game of foreplay with your significant other or potential paramour. With only two players there isn't much point in betting or strategy, so simply deal out hands and reveal them. The player with the lower hand loses a piece of clothing.

, Not everyone who plays strip poker should have to be a supermodel. Just be kind and recognize that the other players are putting themselves out there and shouldn't be judged or insulted for the way they look.

, Some games among adults can turn into something more, but most just involve just a little loss of modesty. If a sexual situation does arise, make sure everyone is happy with that, or keep the game platonic.

, Make sure everyone is playing because they are having fun, and don't force anyone to stay who doesn't want to. If something happens to ruin the good vibe, cut your losses and let everyone go home.

, If you are at a game of strip poker with your romantic partner or a friend you may be attracted to, watching other people see that person naked can spark some unhappy feelings. Keep these instincts in check—getting petty or angry is the fastest way to ruin the game for everyone.

, A little flirtation is expected, but coming on too strong will be a big turn-off to everyone.

Count the empty seats and subtract this count from the maximum table size.,
Notice which players are sitting out, but at the table.,
See the amount of each player's stack.,
Compare the hands per hour with the norm, if it is high, some seats recently got filled, adjust the game type to be tighter.,
Adjust the players seeing the flop percentage from your observations.,
Change your play according to the adjusted players/flop percentage.,When playing with good players, expect that they will be going through the checklist so use the adjusted players/flop percentage.,
If players entering the game are not observant and believe that the game is loose (as it should be for a smaller game), you should play loose.",How to Adjust the Players Per Flop Percentage," For example a 10 player max table with 2 empty seats has 8 players.
, Subtract the number of players sitting out from the maximum table size. For example in a 9 players max table with a player waiting for big blind, this table has 8 players., If the amount is the buy-in amount or if the amount is a round number, that player has most likely just entered the game and is waiting for the big blind., Check the hands played per hour with other games similar to yours.,

If a table had vacant seats, which suddenly got filled, adjust the player/flop percentage lower.
Conversely, if a couple of players simultaneously left a table, adjust the player/flop percentage higher. If a table had 10 players, you had a 1/10 probability of having the best hand, but with 8 players you have a 1/8 probability of having the best hand. Note: 1/10 and 1/8 are not accurate numbers and are presented here for your understanding. Using Poker Tracker, for a 10 player game, the pots won will average less than 10%. However, an exceptional player could have a 10% or higher win rate for a 10 player game.

,

Play more starting hands if a players/flop percentage got larger (the table got more loose). By playing more hands, you will be in action more and have more opportunities to win pots. Give action to get action, you will have your share of good hands in time. It is a lot more fun to be in action, however, calculate whether it is profitable to play hands that are break-even or barely profitable when you include tipping the dealer.
Play less starting hands if a player/flop percentage became smaller (the game is more tight). Playing tight, in this situation, will save you money. Categorize the game and when you are in the early positions and especially under the gun, decide on a strategy to enact.

,, Eventually the game should become more tight, as the new players will not like losing their money, so until that time play loose."

Do not reinvent the wheel.,
Play games against opponents.,
Accept that your studies in poker will change as you progress.,
Keep a journal of your studies and your plays.,
Determine the mix of studying.,
Be prepared for an increase in winning after emphasizing our studying.",How to Play Poker Like a Tiger," There is a wealth of poker information out there in the form of books, videos/DVDs, advice, hand histories, etc. It would take several lifetimes for the average person to accumulate the knowledge that is readily available and it's easier than ever to get hold of information through online sources and online shopping.


Test the knowledge of experts. Use poker software to take statistics on a certain aspect of the game and totally check that your sources are correct (in the particular aspect of the game you've chosen to focus on). Poker software is useful for statistic-taking analysis.
Don't neglect biographies of poker players. You can learn a lot about their mindset from reading such books.;
, Although poker is generally a gambling game, it is also a challenge to the mind and it's a competitive game.


Play against the poker software first. If you cannot beat the software, what is the use of playing against real opponents. Keep trying until you improve a great deal.
Play without money to begin with. Poker is a competition and your opponents will take pride in their game and play ferociously, even if there is no real money involved.
Play with real money where there is a rake, tips, and real opponents, and when you are absolutely confident you're ready to start playing for stakes (and to lose money).

, A world class player studies differently from a novice. A novice has to have the basics absolutely ingrained, things like knowing the rules of the game and learning about bluffing moves. Poker is a mind game, and a good foundation before even studying or playing poker is to study probability and statistics.


It can't hurt to read more broadly about mind games in the field of sports and game playing. You can pick up great tips from other players and sports persons that can help you to maintain your reserve, stamina, and patience.

, Log in the amount of time spent on each and follow a predetermined ratio. Since poker is also fun to play, following the 9:1 ratio of Einstein may not be realistic for most people. However, study time should exceed play.

, This will change over time and may be unbalanced at times.


A raw beginner, before starting to play poker, should read about successful players to determine if poker is a beatable game. It is important to learn from the outset that there are few successful players in games of chance, even with careers spanning decades for professional poker players. Poker however is only partly a game of chance, it is also a game of skill. You don't need to have the best cards to win a hand, this is where bluffing comes in.
Once you decide to take on poker seriously, develop a plan for studying such as: Studying poker book 1 - 40 percent, studying poker book 2 - 10 percent, taking statistics 15 percent, reviewing a past hand or problem hands - 15 percent and making charts - 20 percent. Develop a good plan and stay with it.

, If your goal is to improve, keep studying. While poker is fun, losing is not fun and studying the tactics, statistics, and your own actions can turn this around.


Playing too many games hints at addiction, and while playing gives you experience, this is not as productive to improving your overall game strategies as is studying.

Find one or more friends to play Bullshit Bingo with you.,
Make a list of common business or industry cliches.,
Decide which version of Bullshit Bingo you are going to play.,
Decide on your Bingo signal.,
Decide on a prize.,
Start the meeting or conference call.,
Listen for your phrases.,
Race to Bingo.,
Declare Bingo!",How to Play Bullshit Bingo," You'll want to be recruiting trusted coworkers with a sense of humor who are also annoyed at having to waste time in a meeting or on a call with you. Trying to get the office snitch to play is probably a bad idea.;
, Equity. Buy-in. Engagement. Accountability. Team-culture. Forward-thinking. You'll want to be selecting words or phrases that will come up in the meeting. The best phrases are the ones that come up so often that they make you want to roll your eyes.These phrases are the equivalent of traditional Bingo numbers in Bullshit Bingo. There are websites that can create automatically generated lists and even allow for mobile and tablet play, but creating your own buzzwords is more fun.
You'll want to decide whether you and your opponents will be sharing from a common ""phrase bank"" or making individual ones.
If using your own phrase bank, common phrases that your opponents won't think of are especially valuable. You want to have a few unique phrases that will set you apart from the competition in order to gain an edge.

, Traditional Bullshit Bingo requires a 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 grid of words, requiring either 9, 16, or 25 cliched words and phrases.Simplified Bullshit Bingo only requires a list of a few words and phrases, all of which need to be matched in order to win.


You can also add ""Wild"" spots to your grid if anyone in your game can't quite come up with enough words to fill the grid.
Some players share a pool of collective cliches, but select where on their grid they want them to be listed. Shared words eliminate part of the skill aspect of the game though.

, While saying either ""Bullshit"" or ""Bingo"" would be a clear declaration of victory, either word might be frowned upon during a conference call or meeting. You and your fellow players may want to decide on a funny double-entendre or inside joke that the winner will need to utter in order to declare victory.


Another option is to have the winner speak and incorporate all of their winning cliches. It can require a fair bit of creativity and is hilarious.

, The only thing better than the sweet taste of victory is the refreshing taste of your favorite beverage. Happy Hour drinks for the winner are often a great prize, but lunch in the office cafeteria or exemptions from coffee run duty are also good. Decide on a prize that works for you and your fellow players.

, With your list or grid created, you and your fellow players can begin your scheduled meeting without an overwhelming sense of dread and boredom. You may want to send each other pictures of your respective grids, in order to make sure that no one cheats.

, If you have ""TPS Reports"" as one of your phrases and your boss reminds everyone that a cover page is required for their TPS reports, you score! Cross off or check the cliches on your grid or list as they come up.

, Your otherwise boring meeting has now become a game - and you are racing against your friends. If you are skilled enough to have created a good list, and lucky enough to have had your cliches called you'll be well on your way to victory.

, Or Bullshit. Or your pre-arranged phrase. Whatever your victory parameters were, be sure to declare yourself the winner as fast as possible. Your fellow players may also be sitting on Bingo, waiting for the right opportunity to speak. Don't let anyone else steal your glory, though you all can revel in successfully subverting an otherwise mundane meeting with a little secret fun.

Think of seven locations, preferably using a house you know well.,
Go to the rooms in a logical order.,
""Place"" people (from the list that you previously learned) in each room.,
Number your locations.,
Place the following people in the garden: 00, 06, 17, 23, 28, 34, 45, 51, 56, 62, 73, 79, 84, 90.,
Take each person and their action, and make them interact with each other, using their actions to help concrete the image.,
Note these examples for locations:

Next location: code 1.,
Take your time and get these people into your locations.",How to Tell the Day in Any Year and Century,", Visualize this house, looking first at the garden. Concentrate on it. Notice if there are any plants, trees, a pond etc. Next, go into the house and in order go to each room., Make sure you do this because it will be difficult to recall if you start downstairs and then jump up a floor and then back down again!, This will take up the majority of your time, so do it carefully and enjoy it. You will be creating some unique images you have never thought of before!, Your first location is the garden which is room number zero. To recall that it is room zero you can imagine a giant football crashing onto your flowers!, Each of these numbers represents a person and an action. You learned your 100 people from the techniques earlier., For example, Olive Oil is screaming for help and Ebenezer Scrooge is playing golf with Steve Ballesteros! Before you move on to the next location make sure you know the people and location perfectly., Imagine a telegraph pole in the middle of the room! The people you will need for this room are: 01, 07, 12, 18, 29, 35, 40, 46, 57, 63, 68, 74, 85, 91, 96
Next location: code 2. Imagine a swan, for example, picking at your dinner!: 02, 13, 19, 24, 30, 41, 47, 52, 58, 69, 75, 80, 86, 97
Next location: code 3. Imagine a pair of handcuffs somewhere in the room: 03, 08, 14, 25, 31, 36, 42, 53 59, 64, 70, 81, 87, 92, 98
Next location: code 4. Imagine a boat somewhere in your scene: 09, 15, 20, 26, 37, 43, 48, 54, 65, 71, 76, 82, 93, 99
Next location: code 5. Imagine a hook somewhere in your scene: 04, 10, 21, 27, 32, 38, 49, 55, 60, 66, 77, 83, 88, 94
Next location: code 6. Imagine an elephant’s trunk in your scene: 05, 11, 16, 22, 33, 39, 44, 50, 61, 67, 72, 78, 89, 95

, Once you have that done you will then need to learn the month codes. Each month has its own code to go with it. You are going to recall the code from what the month means to you."

Know that making puzzles benefits a child's first reading skills.,
Know that doing puzzles promotes socializing and interacting with other people.",How to Teach Your Child to Do Puzzles," For starters, use hardwood puzzles with just a few pieces. Later, you can include puzzles with fewer parts that are made from cardboard.


For children aged 2-3 use puzzles with 4-12 pieces, for children aged 3-5 use puzzles with 12-50 pieces, for children aged 5-6 ages use puzzles with 50-100 pieces.;
, You can keep your child interested in puzzles by letting them do puzzles depicting some of their favorite things. These could be puzzles of animals, cartoon characters or words. They could also be colorful ones, displaying scenes from nature or daily life.

, If your child doesn’t seem interested, try doing the puzzle with them and treat it like a game or bonding session instead of a necessary task for your child's mental development.


Children love games and if they see you enjoying the puzzle and spending time with them as you do it, they’ll definitely be more inclined to try it for themselves.

, Who likes being put under pressure? Nobody, especially kids. That's why you should give your child enough time to get the hang of puzzles and learn to enjoy them.


Don’t let them see you lose patience or interest in teaching them how to do it. Always show your happy face and never forget to praise them every time they match some pieces., One piece puzzles are the most basic kind of puzzles. They simply consist of an object that must fit into a hole or outline. You child can start with these as early as 18 months.

, You can introduce your child to shape sorters or wooden peg puzzles once they have the concept of one piece puzzles down.


This is important so that they can understand and match shapes as well as grasp the concept of fitting objects together.
If this is too much for your child, show them how to do it by sorting a few shapes yourself., Two piece puzzles are the next step in teaching puzzle making. This will introduce your child to the idea of completing a picture.


You can show them how to solve the puzzle by completing the puzzle for them or showing them a completed picture.
You can also guide them throughout the entire process of solving the puzzles, to make sure that they are doing it the right way.

, Give your child verbal cues or point to which piece goes where when introducing a puzzle. You can say things like “this goes over here!” or “try this piece!” This will help them think faster.You can also emphasize the matching of each piece by showing it to them up close. Give them fewer cues once they know how to put the puzzle together and can do it on their own.

, Moving on to four piece, six piece, twelve piece and fifteen piece puzzles will get your child doing more difficult puzzles in no time.


Keep the puzzles pieces in the same place until your child knows which piece goes where. Then you can mix up the pieces when they’re confident about doing the puzzle. Taking away one key piece until the very end is an innovative way to keep the puzzle interesting.
Swap puzzles with other parents to keep your child’s mind busy. Avoid rushing into difficult puzzles, as this will only result into confusion and discouragement on their part.

, Doing harder puzzles is possible once your child understands the basics. Help them by laying out the corners first.


If this is too overwhelming for your child then you may help them by loosely arranging the edges of the puzzle, but make sure not to put the puzzles pieces together.
Then you may show them how to match difficult pieces to the edges.

, Building puzzles in sections helps to make the puzzle simpler to complete. Instead of burying your child in a hundred piece puzzle, they can work on one section of it at a time.


For example, if your child is working on a Mickey Mouse puzzle with Minnie and Goofy, they could focus on putting together the pieces for a single character at a time.

, Fine motor skills refer to the coordination of small muscle movements, such as the movements of hands and fingers. As puzzle pieces need to be caught, pinched, rotated, and fit together, making puzzles helps to develop these skills.

, When making a puzzle, children learn to pay attention to details and to find and reach for a specific puzzle piece in a crowd of similar parts.

, Each puzzle presents one small problem. Therefore, the process of making a puzzle involves learning how to cope with problems, difficulties and frustrations. Beside that, making puzzles also helps to build a child's confidence.

, Puzzles allow children learn to think, connect and remember. Puzzles can also be educational, as certain puzzles may help kids to learn numbers, shapes, letters and colors.

, When a child sorts the pieces of a puzzle, they tend to do so from left to right. Thus, the child learns to direct their attention from left to right, as they would when learning to read., Jigsaw puzzle may require your child to work together with you or with other children. While looking for certain pieces, they may have to discuss the different parts of the puzzle and what goes where. This promotes socialization and teamwork."

Have everyone stand in either a line or a circle. Players should be spaced far enough apart that they won't overhear the word when it isn't their turn. Proper position is important when playing telephone., Choose a person to start the game. This person will think of a word and whisper it to the person next to them. The word should be an uncommon one as the idea is to see how much it changes by the game's end. Once the word has been told to the next person, they will whisper it to the person next to them., Players continue listening to the word and repeating what they think they heard to the person next to them. This is done until the last person in the line or circle is told the word. Every person should have heard the word or phrase by the end of the game. , Once the last person hears the word or phrase, they will say what they think they heard out-loud. This is compared to the original word that the game started with. This is the moment when all the players get to learn just how much the word or phrase changed through their “telephone line”., An important rule for the game of telephone, is that you can only say a word or phrase one time. Repeating the phrase will only help to clarify it, going against the point of the game. Only allow those playing one chance to whisper the word or phrase on their turn., The fun of telephone is to see how much a word changes throughout the game. Picking a simple or familiar word will make the game too easy, allowing the word to be heard clearly. Instead, it's a good idea to pick a difficult, long, or unique word to use when playing telephone.Choosing the word ""dog"" is probably a poor choice.
Picking something like ""bayou"" might be a better choice.
Using the word ""misanthropic"" could be a challenging choice.

, It's important that no one but the the person starting the round of telephone knows the word being used. If other players know the word, they will be able to repeat it with ease. Always keep the word a secret to ensure that it ends up being changed by the game's end., You will need to whisper a word or phrase to a person during the game of telephone. Whispering helps in two ways; keeping the word a secret and making it hard to interpret correctly. Keeping the word quiet can make it more likely that it will end up being misheard and wildly different from the starting phrase.

, Playing telephone in teams can add a fun competitive edge to the game. Teams will each play the game in same manner, with one person starting the game off and the players whispering it down the line. However, one player is chosen to whisper the same word to both teams. The goal is to see which team can end the game with the word being closest to the original.Words that are closer will generally sound more alike or be a variation of the original word.
Words that are farther apart from the original will generally have wildly different sounds and meanings.
For example, you may start with the word ""benevolence"". One team ends the game thinking that the word was ""beneficent"", while the other team got ""detriment"". In this case, the team who said ""beneficent"" would be closer to the original word and win the round.

, The rumor variation of the telephone game includes one important difference in the rules. In this version, players are required to make changes. Even if you hear the phrase correctly, you must add one or two differences. This will result in huge changes to the original phrase the game started with. It can be a lot of fun to see just how different the phrase winds up being at the end of a rumor telephone game., If you are finding that your team is able to keep the word or phrase close to the original, you can try making the game harder. Try picking new words or phrases that are more difficult to hear correctly. Keep some of these tips in mind when trying to make the game of telephone a bit more difficult:


Pick longer words or phrases. The more you say, the harder it will be to pass on to the next person. You might try using ""Squirreled"" or ""Can you can a can as a canner can can a can?"".Pick words that aren't often used. For example, ""magnanimous"" isn't said often and may cause players to mishear it.
Use random words that don't have context. For example using “tower, nose, zircon” would make it much more difficult to guess what was said without the context that normal phrases would have.

Plan to practice writing backwards before trying to speak backwards.,

Speak backwards from your head.,
Pick a simple phrase.,
Record yourself.,
Reverse the playback.,
Practice mimicking your recorded voice backwards.,
Record yourself again.,
Play your newly recorded phrase backwards.,
Practice.",How to Speak Backwards," Writing backwards is a skill that will help you greatly while you learn to speak backwards. This is because writing backwards will get you used to quickly flipping around sentences and words, and you'll get familiar with common words and what they look like backwards. If you practice writing backwards, then you'll find it much easier to start speaking backwards.;
, Practice with ""I am learning how to write backwards on wikiHow."" It should be a short sentence. You can work your way up to longer and more complicated sentences as you practice more.

, Type it from the end to the beginning, as if holding a mirror up to the monitor, like this: "".woHikiw no sdrawkcab etirw ot woh gninreal ma I"" (""I am learning how to write backwards on wikiHow"" backwards.)Alternatively, type each word backwards. This is a little easier to read: ""I ma gninrael woh ot klat sdrawkcab no woHikiw.""
You can also do this with pencil and paper. For the most well-rounded practice, do it with both.

, Like most things, practice makes perfect. Spend some time each day thinking of random sentences and writing them in reverse. The more you do it, the faster you will get, until you can type and read backwards like it's nothing.If you want to measure your progress, you can time yourself. Think of a different sentence with the same number of words everyday, and time how long it takes you to write it in reverse.

, For example, ""Watch for sheep in the park."" Keep it simple at first. The sentence should be fairly short, with no commas or long words.

, In this case, it will read ""krap eht ni peehs rof hctaw."" There's no need to capitalize when you write the sentence backwards. In fact, doing so may make it a little harder to read.

, You can't just write down any word backwards and read it by pronouncing each letter in order. That's because some letters we don't pronounce separately, but in combination with others, like ""ch"" and ""sh"". So the next step after writing the sentence down is to alter it make it readable. So in this example, ""krap eht ni peehs rof hctaw,"" should be changed to ""krap eth ni peesh rof chtaw.""

, Don't worry about inflection and tone. Just focus on pronouncing the strange words how you intuitively think they look like they're pronounced.

, The next step is to start practicing reading things backwards before writing them backwards. Find a book near you that has simple language and vocabulary. Try reading some sentences out of it in reverse by looking at the last letter in the last word first, and reading from right to left.


The tricky part about this is learning to make the appropriate edits when it comes to sounds like ""wh"" and ""ch"" on the fly. So when you see a word like ""charge,"" you don't try to say ""egrahc,"" you say ""egrach.""

, The final step is to start practicing saying things backwards without reading them or writing them down first. Think of a simple sentence. Start with the last word in the sentence, and pronounce it starting with the last letter, going backwards. Visualize the words backward in your head if it helps. ,
For this example, let's try ""I like peaches and cream."" The key to this method is to keep it short because you'll be memorizing and repeating unusual sounds.

, Start your recording device, and record yourself saying the phrase normally. Speak slowly and clearly.


There are apps for phones that can record and reverse speech, if you don't have a voice recorder.

, This way you can hear yourself saying the phrase backwards.

, Try to use the exact tones and inflections of the phrase. ""I like peaches and cream"" should sound something like ""mEERk nuzuchEEP kyaleye."" You can practice copying it over and over until you sound just like the recording.

, When you think you are ready, record yourself speaking the phrase backwards.

, In other words, play the recording of yourself speaking backwards in reverse. The result will be a strange version of yourself speaking the original sentence. The closer this sounds to normal speech, the better you spoke backwards.

, Spend some time each day coming up with sentences, writing them down backwards, and speaking them. Keep recording yourself, and use those recordings to perfect your backwards speech. As you get better, use longer sentences and eventually, paragraphs."

Create your bingo cards.,
Think of keywords that are associated with Christmas.,
Write the keywords around the cards.,
Distribute the cards out before the game starts.,
Call out the terms or questions.,
Declare a winner.",How to Make a Christmas Themed Bingo Game," Instead of having ""BINGO"" at the top of the cards, substitute it with ""SANTA"" or ""SNOWY"". Make it creative.;
, You might think of things like the weather, the holiday tradition, presents, Jesus, etc.


Snow
Jolly
St. Nick
Eggnog
Snowman
Ornaments
Skiing

, It's up to you to use the same keywords on every card or have different cards say other terms. This is useful when lots of terms are built up or allow people to have the opportunity to find different things from others. If you are using all character images, be sure to write down all of them so that you can call them out.

, Make sure that everyone has enough time so that they know what they're looking for beforehand.

, Have the participants eliminate the terms found on their card.


If the cards won't be used in the future, you can have them cross them out with a marker. You can always preserve them for future games and use tokens or coins to cover them.

, Once a person's card is completely blacked out first, then a winner can be declared. Depending on the complexity of the keywords, people can complete a standard Bingo row or column (up, down, or diagonal).

Split the room into two teams.,
Hand each person 4-10 small pieces of paper (depending on the skill of the group), about 2"" by 3"" and a pen or pencil.,
Collect all paper pieces (for example if there are 10 people playing there will be 40-100 celebrity names) and put them in a large container.,
Put all celebrity names back into the container for ROUND TWO.,
Put all celebrity names back into the container for ROUND THREE.,
Add up the total of all three rounds for both teams.","How to Play the Party Game ""Celebrity"""," Preferably the same number of people on each team. Choose a team to go first.;
, Each person writes the name of one famous person on each of their paper pieces. The famous person can be anyone alive or dead, celebrity, scientist, historical figure, fictional character, political figure, author, etc. Fold paper in half.

,


ROUND ONE: Team One picks a player to go first. Player #**1 draws a celebrity from the container and has one minute to try to get their team members to guess who the celebrity is by giving clues according to the following ROUND ONE RULE: Player can use any words to describe the celebrity BUT cannot say the celebrity's name in any form. Player can also give other clues about the celebrity (without having to mimic) but once again, cannot say the celebrity's name in any form.








For example, if the celebrity I selected was Jello Biafra, I could either sing a Dead Kennedys song, or I could say ""my first name sounds like a dessert treat"".


Once the team has guessed it (preferably before the minute is up) the Player #1 keeps the paper for tallying later and can now pick another paper and give clues for that celebrity. No passing is allowed. Player must continue to give clues and remain on the celebrity chosen until the Team guesses it or time expires. If, by mistake the Player accidentally says the celebrity's name, the Team forfeits and play goes to the other Team.


ROUND ONE: Team Two picks a player to go first and follows the same rules as above in step 4. That player gets a full minute to get through as many celebrity names as they can.
ROUND ONE: Continue to go back and forth between Team One and Team Two with new team members each time until all names have been used up from the container. ROUND ONE ends when all celebrity names have been used up. Both Teams should tally the total number of celebrity names they have and write them down on a sheet of paper.

,


ROUND TWO: Begins wherever ROUND ONE left off in terms of the Team and the next Player. ROUND TWO RULE: Players get one minute to give clues for the celebrity name they draw, however, clues must be ONE WORD ONLY, there is no body gesturing or facial clues allowed.

For example, if I want to describe Cher, I could say Sonny.
The key to this round is choosing the one best word to say to help your team members figure out who you are trying to describe. Success in this round is also about paying attention in ROUND ONE. If you can remember who all of the celebrities were in ROUND ONE this will help you guess successfully in ROUND TWO. Players can continue to choose names as they get their teams to guess successfully, and as long as they continue to have time left on the timer.


ROUND TWO: Play continues back and forth between Teams as in Step 6 above. ROUND TWO ends when all celebrity names are used up. Both Teams should tally the total number of celebrity names they have and write them down on a sheet of paper.

,


ROUND THREE: Begins wherever ROUND TWO left off in terms of the Team and the next Player. ROUND THREE RULE: No words or sounds are allowed to be spoken at all. Players can only mimic and gesture to give clues. Play continues back and forth until all celebrity names are chosen. Both Teams should tally the total number of celebrity names they have and write them down on a sheet of paper at the end of ROUND THREE.

Form a circle by untangling your knot.,

Have a human knot unraveling race.",How to Play the Human Knot Game," As the saying goes, the more the merrier, and this is certainly true when playing the Human Knot game! If you're supervising this game with young children, you may find smaller groups are more manageable and the knots formed less complicated. The ideal number of players for this game is 8 - 20, though you can play with as few as four people.If you want to give this game a try but don't have camp mates or a babysitting group to play with, you might invite your neighbors to play. You could even invite your friends to play with you in the park and encourage others in the park to join in.;
, You and your friends will circle up and join your hands together to form a human knot out of your arms. The goal of the game is to untangle yourselves without letting go of the hands you are holding. After untangling, you will be standing once again in a regular circle, without any joined hands in the middle.You can always add goals to create your own version of the Human Knot game. For example, if you and your friends want a challenge or to race the clock, you could set a timer on your cell phone as a time limit., Circle up with the rest of the players so that each person is standing closely to the next. Player will to have to reach across the circle to form your human knot, so with large groups of people you may have to scrunch together tightly.After you're in your circle, reach out and hold hands with two different people in the circle, excluding the two people to either side of you. Each left hand should hold a left hand, and each right hand a right.


Although it's against the rules to let go of the hands you are holding while playing the game, you may have to readjust your grip at some point. You'll likely have to bend and twist to untangle. Readjusting your grip is perfectly acceptable for players to be more comfortable while playing., Communicate with the other players in your Human Knot to figure out where to begin untangling. If you are supervising younger children, you may need to encourage them to do this. There may be an easy part of the knot that comes undone quickly, which will free up more slack for others in the knot.Especially when working with children, but also when playing with your friends, you'll want to be sure that everyone is gentle when untangling. Pulling or yanking too hard might hurt someone!
In the beginning, the knot will be tight and thick with many crossed arms. You and your group might want to take a step backwards, if possible. This way you have a better perspective of the Human Knot.

, You and the other players should be ready to bend, twist, and move in any way that is required for untangling your knot. You may find you or others need to duck under the hands of other players, step over a pair of hands, or do similar moves to untangle your knot.Since this game requires some measure of flexibility, you may want to consider stretching first.


While playing, you should always try to be respectful of the boundaries of others. If you find yourself in an uncomfortable position with another player, you might ask if other players can help you out by untangling a different part of the knot.

, You'll notice, as your knot becomes untangled, that a circle will start to form. Some people may end up facing the inside of the circle, some the outside, but by the time you've finished untangling, you should have an unbroken circle of joined hands. Congratulations! You've untangled the Human Knot!In some cases, you may have done your job of knotting together too well! This means you won't always be able to unravel your knot, in which case, you can break apart and try again., This is an excellent variation for smaller groups where you can rotate between players to have different people directing the Human Knot. To play this variation, one of the players should leave the room or turn away from other players as they get tangled together. Then, players can only move in the way they are instructed by the director.You might have fun adding a prop to set the knot director apart from other players. For example, you might give the knot director a play megaphone, a special hat, or a badge.

, Ice breakers often help you to learn the names of those you are playing with. You can add this challenge to the Human Knot as well! All you need to do is add a rule that states players can only talk to other players by saying that player's name, first.To encourage players to use names, you might institute a minor penalty for those who don't use first names. Every time a name isn't used, players might agree that rule breakers have to do five push ups after the game is finished, or you could have players that don't use names help you set up for the next activity.

, You should exercise caution when using this kind of variation. Since the limbs of players will be tangled together, it's easy to fall down or lose balance, which could potentially hurt somebody.However, older kids and adults might find the Human Knot more challenging with:


Every other player blindfolded. This way, players who aren't blindfolded have to help direct those who are, which encourages teamwork even more.
Course obstacles. Uneven terrain can make keeping your balance while unknotting very difficult, but you should be careful about tripping hazards. Young kids might have a blast playing the Human Knot game in a bounce house.

, With large groups especially, you may find you need to break into groups to play the Human Knot game effectively. If this is the case for your group, you can add a competitive challenge by having both teams try to unravel faster than the other."

Divide your group into teams.,
Load cards into the card holder.,
Draw one card at a time.,
Start the timer.,
Give your teammates clues about the guess-word.,
Avoid the taboo words.,
Have an opponent watch and listen for the taboo words.,
Separate the cards into two piles during each round.,
Score the round.,
Give clues quickly but carefully.,
Use synonyms and antonyms.,
Describe multiple meanings that a word could have.,
Pass on words that take too long.",How to Play the Game of Taboo," Do your best to have an even number of people on each team. You also want to try to make the teams even in regards to skill level. Match new players up with more skilled players, and young players with older players.


You might do guys versus girls or some other simple way to split up the teams. One team could be all of the people with birthdays that fall during January-June, and the other team could be those with birthdays in July-December.
If you have an odd number, it might be good to work out a system where one person on the bigger team sits out each round, or that person has to give clues an extra time.
When you have couples or family members playing together, it can be a good idea to put them on separate teams so that they do not have any kind of advantage over the other players.;
, Before each turn starts, you’ll want to fill the card holder with cards so that the clue-giving player can flip through them faster. You don’t want to have to draw from a pile unless you run out.This is more of a suggestion than a rule, because it makes the game run smoother but is not mandatory. If you want to draw each card from the pile, that is fine, too.
You can play the game if you only have the Taboo cards and none of the other equipment. Gameplay can progress in the same way. You could even write up your own cards with a guess-word and Taboo words that you decide yourself.

, You can not look ahead at any of the other cards in the deck. You can only look at each card as you draw it to begin giving clues for it. If you catch someone looking ahead, you need to call them out on it as this is cheating.


Make sure that each time you draw no one on your team can see the card you have drawn. If one of your teammates does see it, you must take it out of play, but your opponent does not get the point for it.

, Each player has a certain amount of time to get their teammates to guess as many words as they can. It might be good to designate someone on each turn who is going to pay attention to the timer. You can also switch to a timer that makes noise when it runs out.


You could use a timer on someone’s phone so that it will make noise when it goes off. Each round should be 1-2 minutes. You can decide on a longer or shorter time limit to change up the game.
The card you are looking at when the timer runs out is not scored for anyone and should be discarded, rather than passed on to the next player.

, If the guess-word is “book,” you might give clues like “something you use to study in school,” and “a large collection of words that has a main plot.” You score points when your teammates guess the word. You can’t use any part of the word or any of the taboo words that are listed.If you get to a word that you don’t know, or your teammates are having a hard time guessing it, you can skip the card. However, if you do skip a card, that point goes to the other team.
If the guess-word is cookbook, then you can’t use “cook” or “book” within any of your clues.
Your teammates must guess the exact word, so if they get it close, or get part of the word, you need to keep giving them clues until they get it exactly right.

, Each card includes some of the most obvious related words and designates those as taboo words, meaning that you are not allowed to say them. For “book,” the taboo words might be “pages,” “read,” “story,” “paperback,”and “text.” You’ll lose a point if you say a taboo word, so it’s important to be careful.You can’t even say part of the taboo word. So if the word is “automobile,” you can’t say ""auto.""

, Each round, one player on the non-guessing team is a watchdog making sure you don’t use any of the taboo words. Take turns having each player on each team be the one to hold the buzzer and keep track of taboo word use.


When you hear the clue giver say one of the taboo words, you buzz them. Put the card into a discard pile for that round. Put skipped cards into the same discard pile.

, One pile is for cards that the guessing team got correct. The second pile is for cards that the clue-giver skipped and cards on which the clue-giver accidently said the guess-word or any of the taboo words.


Make sure that everyone is clear on which pile is which as they set cards down. It is important to keep the piles separated for accurate scoring.

, The clue-giving team gets one point for all of the cards that were guessed correctly. The opponents get one point for each card in the discard pile. The discard pile includes skipped cards and any cards the clue-giver got buzzed on.


You can decide to play to a certain score, or for a certain number of rounds, whichever you prefer.
Make sure not to score the card that the timer ran out on for anyone. It gets put out of the deck until the end of the game.
Take all of the cards used during that round and set them aside. Don’t use them again until the entire deck has been used. At that point, if you are still playing, you can shuffle the deck and start using the cards again.

, Part of what makes Taboo enjoyable is the manic quality of clue giving, so don’t be afraid to say as much information as quickly as you can. The one point of being careful is to still avoid saying any of the taboo words.


Read the guess-word and all of the taboo words before you begin to give any clues. You want to remember what words you can’t say.
If you realize partway into giving your clues that you said something early on that was a bad clue and that actually confused your teammates, you can tell them to disregard that clue.

, If you can get people thinking about words that are similar to the word you’re describing, you can get them on the right track. Remember, you can’t say “sounds like” or “rhymes with,” so don’t try to use these in your clues.


For example, if the guess-word is poster, you might be able to described it as a wall hanging, or a picture.
If the guess-word was angry, you could say, “It is not happy or pleased.”

, Many words that you’ll get could have more than one meaning, and it doesn’t matter which meaning you describe. So using the various meanings of words will help people make the connection about what those meanings have in common.If you have a word like bank, you can get people there by describing the place you deposit money or the edge of a river.
If the word is chicken, you could describe it as a farm animal and also what you call someone who is acting afraid. You could describe when two cars are racing toward each other until one of them veers out of the way.

, Sometimes you’ll get a word that your team gets stumped on. Even though you lose a point for passing, if you move on to other words that are easier, then you can get more points for your team. Losing one point is worth gaining three if you can.It’s quite common for someone to win 6 points in a 1-minute round, so don’t spend more than about 15 seconds on a given word. It’s likely that the point you’ll earn won’t be worth it
You still want to do this with discretion because if you pass on too many, then you’ll just end up with less points than your opponent. Only pass when it is absolutely necessary to help your team come out on top.

Whenever you watch a movie where someone has ice powers, take a small glance at your hands for a second.",How to Pretend to Have Ice Powers," Every person who has ice powers has to know about the ice and snow and wintertime. Learn about how snow is formed, what snow crystals look like, and weather patterns in various parts of the world, especially where you live.;
, Start with ""The Snow Queen"" By Hans Christian Anderson, as this is what Frozen is based off of. The Snow Queen in this story has ice powers, and you could learn a lot from her.

, Watch Frozen or Rise of the Guardians, two great movies with characters with ice powers. Pay attention to how these powerful characters act, what they do and say, and especially how they like the cold. Some other characters with ice powers include Frozone from The Incredibles, the Ice King from Adventure Time, and Iceman from X-Men.

, Although bleaching your whole head is a viable option, it's not necessary. Instead, add a few white streaks or highlights here and there. Or you can just get some white hair extensions so you don't damage your hair.

, Have some winter jewelry like snowflake charms or other wintry patterns. You can wear necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets, bows, or anything else that strikes your fancy - but take it easy; don't wear all these things at the same time or you'll look like you're trying too hard and people will be suspicious.

, Wear blues, whites, silvers, and maybe a little bit of black. You can wear normal colors too, but winter colors should form most of your wardrobe.


Wear casual and sometimes over-the-moon fancy outfits. For example, think of Frozen themed outfits. Wear casual blue or white long or occasionally short shirts. Wear sweaters in the shades blue, dark blue, light blue, and white. And for pants wear some long spandex or leggings in the colors black, blue, white, and gray.
Maybe use accessories such as a hood over your head, or a casual scarf.
Wear occasional fancy blue, or white dresses.


Wear this sort of gear often, according to the event and try to wear more dresses at home, so that you don't have to conceal your true ways.







, If you do, it'll look like the snow or cold doesn't affect you, which is true of people with ice powers. Or it will look like you have some power that keeps you warm and the cold out, which also suggests ice powers. Just make sure you're not shivering all the time - then, people will notice.

, Wear casual, wintry style, a little white or light blue and sometimes shimmery eyeshadow.


If you don't have blue eyes, consider wearing blue eye contacts. Every person with ice powers has blue eyes. They should be bright blue or ice blue, and if possible, they should have a snowflake pattern in the iris to be even more believable. This step is optional, especially if you hate the thought of sticking contacts in when you don't need them.

, Wear a nude lip, some mascara, with a bit of bronzer or darker blush to top it off. You can also cover up any blemishes with concealer.

, Just a little bit, to give some sheen. Don't do this if you're handling fabric or objects that will get stained.

, Just maybe hold your hand straight out at the faucet or cup of water or something when you know someone's about to walk in. Pretend to concentrate on what your freezing. At first, pretend that you don't see the person there, then say something like, ""It won't work!"" or ""Why can't I freeze this!?"" and then stare at the person in a shocked and slightly alarmed expression. Maybe tell them to not mention this to any living soul, and then quickly walk out of there and into your room before they can ask any questions.

, So when someone grabs your hands, they will feel cold. They may ask you why. Just say something like ""Oh! U-uh, no reason! No reason at all!"" Then walk away. Don't forget to reapply the eyeshadow onto the palms of your hands, if you had added any.

, Act aware whenever you hear someone say ""winter"" or ""snow"" or something like that. This will give the impression that you care a lot about winter and about what others think of it, which would be true if you really did have ice powers - you'd want to know what others thought of your creations.

, Act like the cold doesn't affect you. Don't take this overboard - there's no reason to spend all of your time in the snow with nothing but a bathing suit on. But spending a lot of your time in the snow and acting like it's nothing could help you convince others of your powers. If there's no snow, give the impression that it's always too hot - keep the air conditioning on and always leave the fans going.

, Like Elsa, you would be scared to hurt people with your powers, so you keep the people out of your life. Be reserved and introverted - this will also help give the impression that you don't want to spend lots of time with others because you have something to hide. Just don't ditch school or something like that.

, Your voice has to be as beautiful as winter itself. Avoid singing too much or people will think you're only trying to show others how good you are. Then, they'll start to ignore, avoid, and/or dislike you, and your prank won't work.

, And make sure people notice but don't look at them every time someone uses them or every second of the movie; otherwise they will know you're trying too hard and ignore you the rest of the movie."

Get to know indie rock.,
Start playing the indie rock game.",How to Play the Indie Rock Game," There's no chance you'll win a game of Monopoly if you've only got a dollar and the thimble. The same logic with the indie rock game applies here: you've gotta come prepared.


Start studying by reading ""Our Band Could be Your Life"", learn about the rising of indie labels like Dischord, SST, Sub Pop, etc.
Then start fishing around on the internet, check Emusic.com (there's a ton of indie stuff there).
Get to know the artists' music. Is it really indie rock? Is it pop? Know your history about the bands you're listening to. Did the drummer leave for record 2 but come back by record 4? Did the lyrics get insanely weak on record 5? Is the only original member left by record 2 the bassist?
Find other people who are into indie rock. These types are easy to find. Just go to the hippest rock club you can find in your town or nearby and walk up to anyone who is standing completely still while watching a band. Another good sign is that they're drinking the cheapest beer available from a tall can. Note that if someone is talking during a band's set they are most likely not into indie rock or the indie rock game (unless the band on stage is viciously bad; then it's a wild card).;
, As mentioned before, the indie rock game is a delicate and mysterious dance that should be played with care. However, it should be initiated at the drop of a hat. The rules seem simple enough, but there are many delicate details.


the indie rock game always starts with ""hey, have you heard the new "" "" record? It's the proper beginning question as it is none too threatening and allows the opponent the option to pass on playing. However, if the opponent locks eyes with you and says ""yes"", it's on!

The proper response to the initial question is ""yes I have, but their last record was better"". Thus far we've established a serve and a return, and now a volley has started and the game can go anywhere from here.


BAND OFF! each party in the game now frantically starts listing bands that are similar to the indie band initially mentioned. You don't even have to wait for the other party to finish before you can jump in. Every time your opponent doesn't know of a band, you get 5 points; every time you get into specifics like line up changes and record titles that your opponent is unaware of, you get 10 points and vice versa.
How major is too major? This is one of those questions that is very delicate as opinions vary greatly, so play with care. While you can say Nirvana was a gateway band to many other indie bands, they might be a little too major, as in Panic At the Disco, Duran Duran, and John Tesh (though he is not indie rock, and if anyone ever plays the ""Tesh Card"", they are automatically disqualified). However, if you were into these bands while they were muddling around pre-major record label, you can score pretty high. For example, I met a guy who saw the Police play in a bar with just him, his friend, and the bartender. If that's not capture a band at the peak of there indie-ness, I don't know what is. Such a stellar feat of catching a band before they broke is worth at least 250 points.
How indie is too indie? Yet another delicate issue. Since the point of the indie game is to stump your opponent by showing you have more indie knowledge and credibility, you want to know as many bands as possible, but the catch is that they should be good indie bands. Local and Regional bands are allowed, but if they've never put out a record, play out very infrequently, or you happen to be dating someone who's in the band, it doesn't count, and can lead to disqualifications. Making up indie bands on the spot doesn't count either. If the band is a local band and your opponent chooses to look up their music within three days of the game, and can get a form signed by 20 people that says they've listened to band ""x"" and find them unbearably awful then your points can be revoked.
Have the Dance Off: if it becomes clear that both parties are well versed in indie rock, the only way to settle the game is with a good indie rock dance off. Put on some Bad Brains or early Smiths and shake what your mother endowed upon you. The winner of the dance off is the one with the most unique indie rock like dance moves who comes off the least concerned about it.

(yes we go down from 6). Winning: the winner of the indie rock game is the one with the most points or the winner of the dance off. Remember, any local bands used for points can potentially be revoked within 3 days if the loser can prove that he and 20 other people find the local band(s) mentioned to be absolutely unbearable and not worth the garage they practice in. So don't celebrate immediately, instead, shake your opponent's hand, walk off into the corner, and watch the rest of the show. Once it's officially determined that you've won, you can start a blog with which to brag about your victory or your can add it to any already existing blog about how great you are. Tell friends and family, make a shirt that says ""All your indie is belong to me"", buy a pet and brag to it ALL the time about your vast indie rock knowledge. It's these victories that make you a better person. As they say, give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day, whoop a man's ass at the Indie Rock game and he'll eat his shoe for a week!

Common versions include tabletop, live action role-playing (LARP), and pen-and-paper. You'll need to decide which of these you plan on making before you go any farther on your RPG making journey.Tabletop RPGs often involve a game leader, frequently called a dungeon master or DM, who draws maps that are used on a tabletop along with descriptions to create the setting for the game.
LARP has players imagine the setting as though it were real life. Players then adopt the persona of a character to complete the tasks involved in the game.
Pen-and-paper games are mostly, if not entirely, text based. These games may make use of supplemental materials, like maps or pictures, but rely on written text and spoken descriptions to drive the action of the game.;
, A player character's stats gives it a baseline for what it can do and how it will act. Common stats include strength, intelligence, wisdom, charisma, and dexterity. To give you an example of how stats affect characters, a character with high strength but low charisma would likely be powerful in battle but clumsy in diplomatic situations.In many RPGs, the game begins with players creating a character and using a set number of points to invest in different stats. At the start of a game, you might have each player start with 20 stat points to apply to different stat categories.
Some popular RPGs use 10 as the baseline for all stats. A 10 rating represents average human ability in the stat category. So 10 strength would be average human strength, 10 intelligence would yield a character of average intelligence, and so on.
Additional stat points are usually given to characters as experience is gained over time, through in-game events, or through battles. Experience is usually given in the form of points, with a certain number of points equaling a ""level up,"" which indicates a stat increase.
Make sure your stats match up with your character description. For example, a character that's a ranger class will likely be crafty and move silently, so it often has high dexterity. Wizards, on the other hand, rely on their knowledge of magic, so these kinds of characters often have high intelligence., Now that you have your main stats, you can decide how you'll use them in your game. Some games use a stat-limit check, where tasks will have a rating that character stats will have to match or beat to perform. Other games use a number to represent the difficulty of a task, a dice roll to represent a character's attempt at the action, and stats to provide bonus modifiers to the dice roll.


The dice roll/stat modifier mechanic is very common for tabletop RPGs. For example, a player might have to climb a rope. This might have a challenge rating of 10 for a roll of a 20-sided die. This means a player will have to roll a 10 or higher to climb the rope. Since climbing involves dexterity, the player might get bonus points added to their rope climbing roll for having high dexterity.
Some games use stats as a way of determining point pools which can be ""spent"" on actions. For example, for each point of strength, a player might get 4 points of health. These generally decrease when damage is taken from enemies or increase when a restorative, like a health potion, is taken by a character.
There are other stat-use mechanics you might come up with for your RPG, or you might combine two common mechanics, like the stat-limit and dice roll/stat modifier mechanics., Classes refers to the job or specialty of a character in your RPG. Common classes include warriors, paladins, thieves, rogues, hunters, priests, wizards, and more. Often times, classes are given bonuses for activities related to their class. For example, a warrior would likely receive a bonus for combat maneuvers.Bonuses are usually added to a dice roll to make the outcome of an event more likely. If a warrior needs to roll a 10 or higher on a 20-sided die to accomplish his action, he might get 2 bonus points added to his roll.
You can create your own classes for different scenarios in your RPG. Were you playing a futuristic RPG with fantasy elements, you could invent a class like ""Technomage"" for a class that uses both technology and magic.
Some games involve different races which sometimes have special racial attributes. Some common races in RPGs are elves, gnomes, dwarves, humans, orcs, fairies/fey, halflings, and more.

, Most RPGs use an experience point growth mechanic. This means that for each foe a character beats in your RPG the character will receive special ""experience points."" After a certain number of experience points are gained, characters level up and are given additional stat points for the level earned. This represents the growth of their abilities over time.You might base the development of characters around significant events in your RPG. For example, you could award a level up and stat points to player characters following each major battle in your campaign.
You might also consider to award stat points to characters after the completion of certain quests or goals.

, Style of play refers to the structure of gameplay in your RPG. Most RPGs use a turn based structure, where players commit actions one at a time. You might also consider using a timed ""free phase,"" where players can freely commit actions for a set span of time.You can determine order with a roll of a 20-sided die. Have each player roll a die. The highest number will take the first turn, the second highest takes the second turn, and so on.
Settle draws with a roll-off. When two or more players roll the same number, have these players roll again amongst themselves. The highest roller in this roll-off will go first, followed by the second highest roller, and so on.

, Characters in your RPG will have to move through the game environment, so you'll have to decide how they'll do so. Many games divide movement into two phases: combat and overworld. You might make use of these phases or invent your own movement mechanic.Combat movement is usually turn based, with each player character and non-player character each getting a turn. On that turn, each character can generally move a certain distance and commit an action. Movements and action generally depend on things like character class, equipment weight, and character race.
Overworld movement usually is the preferred style for long distances. To represent this, many RPGers use figurines moved across a map or blueprint. This phase usually has players move any distance they desire on a turn by turn basis.
Character movement is usually determined with regard to weight and class considerations. For example, a character wearing heavy armor will be more encumbered and move more slowly. Physically weak classes, like clerics, wizards, and priests, usually move slower than physically strong classes, like rangers, fighters, and barbarians.

, Though not all RPGs will have an economy, characters usually earn or find some kind of currency on fallen foes or from completing quests. This currency can then be traded with non-player characters for items or services.Awarding too much currency to characters can sometimes result in the game becoming imbalanced. Keep this in mind when conceiving your RPG economy.Common forms of currency in RPGs includes gold, diamonds, precious minerals, and coinage.

, It's easy sometimes to skip a step or forget to apply a penalty or bonus modifier. Having a clearly written description of how players are supposed to play the game will help prevent disagreements and establish clear guidelines while playing.You might consider printing a copy of the main mechanics for each player. This way, players can remind themselves of the rules when necessary.

, Over the course of your adventures, characters may fall ill or be struck with an attack that influences their physical ability. Common varieties of status ailment include poison, paralysis, death, blindness, and unconsciousness.Magic spells are often the cause of status effects. It may be helpful for you to make a list of spells that affect the physical condition of characters.
Poisoned or enchanted weapons are another common route status effects are applied to player characters.

, Not all status effects result in damage being done, though most wear off over time. In the case of paralysis, a player character might only have to forfeit a turn or two before the effect wears off. Deadly poison, on the other hand, can linger and cause damage over time.You might establish a baseline for the damage of certain effects. For poison, you might decide that weak poison causes 2 damage per turn, medium poison 5 damage, and strong poison 10 damage.
You can also decide damage with a roll of the dice. Using poison as the example again, you might roll a four sided die each turn to determine the amount of damage done by the poison.
The duration of a status effect might take the form of a standard limit or it could be decided upon with a roll a die. If poison might last anywhere from 1 to 6 turns, you could roll a 6-sided die to determine the length of this effect., After spending time and effort creating characters for your RPG, it can be discouraging if the character dies and has no means of coming back. Many games use a special reviving item to prevent this from happening. Two common items that revive fallen characters are ankhs and phoenix feathers.


To make character death a more serious condition, you might institute a penalty to fallen characters. Characters who have been revived might rise in a weakened state and only be able to move half the distance they would normally.

, Though some status effects may be incurable, in most RPGs there are local remedies, magical potions, and restorative herbs that can heal a character. Rare conditions, like a special kind of disease, will often require a special quest item for the cure to be made.You could make the creation of these remedies a part of your game play. You can do this by requiring characters to hunt for components for these before brewing them up.
Common remedies are oftentimes found in the shops of towns and paid for with some kind of currency found or won during the course of the game.

, Many RPGs make use of a villain, also called an antagonist, to give players a clear enemy. However, the conflict of your RPG might be something else entirely, like a natural disaster or a disease outbreak. In either case, conflict will help to motivate your characters to action in your game.


Conflict can either be active or passive. An example of active conflict could be something like a chancellor trying to overthrow a king, while a passive conflict might be something like a dam weakening over time and threatening a city., It can be difficult to imagine a setting without a point of reference. You don't have to be a brilliant artist, but a brief sketch of the dimensions of a setting will help players orient themselves. Many RPG creators will divide maps into two types: overworld and instance.


An overworld map is generally a map that depicts the world at large. This might only include a city and the outlying area, but could also include an entire world or continent.
An instance map usually establishes the boundaries of a specific player event, like a battle or a room in which a puzzle must be solved.
If you're not very artistic, try using simple shapes like squares, circles, and triangles to indicate objects and boundaries of a setting., In RPGs, lore usually refers to the background information of your game. This might include things like mythology, history, religion, and culture. These things can give your RPG a sense of depth and help you to know how non-player characters, like townspeople, will interact with player characters.


Lore can also be useful for developing the conflict in your RPG. For example, there might be an uprising creating chaos in a city in your game.
You may want to write out notes for the lore in your RPG to help you keep the details straight while role-playing.
For common knowledge lore that player characters should know, you might write up a separate sheet containing this information for players., The temptation to cheat can be great, especially if you're only 10 gold away from buying that fancy new item. To keep those playing your game honest, you may want a central person, like the game coordinator, to keep notes on players and items for the duration of your game.This kind of in-game bookkeeping is also a good way of keeping your game realistic. If a character has more items than they should be able to carry, that character might deserve a movement penalty for being encumbered.

Swap the chocolate for peanuts.",How to Play the Knife and Fork Chocolate Game," The chocolate should be kept in its original foil and paper wrapper.If your chocolate is already unwrapped, wrap multiple layers of wrapping paper around it.


If you don’t have wrapping paper handy, try wrapping with newspaper. Though not as pretty, this simple fix will up the difficulty of the game.Be cautious of the presence of nuts in chocolate. If necessary, check the chocolate is nut-free by looking at the label near the nutritional information.;
, This promotes better hygiene than keeping it on the table of floor, and also makes moving the chocolate more difficult, therefore, a funnier, long-lasting game.

, Suggested items are hats, scarves, gloves, or jewellery. If space allows, put the pile within the circle of participants.Increase the difficulty by including a bulky pair of gloves. This prevents easy access to the chocolate by the fumbling players.

, After their turn is over, they should pass to the left of them.If the player rolls a six, they should shout “six”. The objective is to get the highest roll possible in order to get a turn at eating the chocolate bar.If the player doesn’t roll a six, keep the die passing on. Only when a six is rolled does the participant get to try eat the chocolate.

, The player can then attempt to eat the chocolate.The player is only allowed to open and eat the chocolate bar with the knife and fork.


Ensure the player does not attempt to eat the chocolate before being fully dressed. The knife and fork cannot be picked up until all dress up items are put on., When another player gets a six, they shout ""six!"". The player in the center has to stop and undress. It is the turn of the new player to try and eat the chocolate.The game then continues on.


The dice should never stop rolling. By keeping the dice rolling at all times, the game is extended and there are more opportunities for other participants to eat the chocolate., Each square of chocolate must be cut using the knife and fork. The fork is used by the player to eat the chocolate. The chocolate is eaten one piece at a time until there is nothing left. Each square of chocolate eating in a win.


If you’re concerned about germs, offer each player their own fork., Whoever eats the last square of chocolate is declared winner and receives a prize. This allows all participants to have a shot at a bite of chocolate.

, The person who eats the first square is the winner and gets a prize. The prize can be the entire bar of chocolate, or can be a separate prize and the chocolate could be shared among participants.

, By swapping the chocolate for peanuts and the fork and knife for chopsticks, the difficulty of the game increases."

Lay five cards on the table, left to right.,
Place the remainder of the deck face-down in front of the dealer.

,
Starting with the left-most card, the player must guess whether the next card in the deck will be higher or lower than the face-up card.

,
The dealer turns over the top card in the deck, and matches it with the player's guess.,
When the player gets to the third card, he must guess red or black instead of higher or lower.

,
The fourth and fifth cards are played the same as the first card.

,
The player is not done playing until he guesses all five cards in the sequence correctly -- even if he moves through the entire deck.

,
When a player finishes running the gauntlet successfully, the deck is reshuffled and the game moves to the next person.

",How to Play The Gauntlet," The first two cards go face-up, the third card goes face-down, and the last two cards go face-up.;
,,, A tie counts as a loss.


For example, if a 6 of hearts is showing, and the player guesses ""higher"", he wants a number greater than 6 to show up.
If the card matches the player's guess, he moves on to the next card.
If his guess is wrong, the player takes a drink, and starts back at the beginning.

Decide what kind of wizard you want to be.,
Make or buy a costume.,
Get a wand.,
Add accessories.,
Carry “magic potions.” Buy fake potion bottles online, or make your own.,
Use magical vocabulary.,
Make wizardry-related comments.,
Mention spells in conversation.,
Take credit for strange events.,
Adopt character traits of a wizard.,
Perform magic tricks.,
Act strangely.",How to Pretend to Be a Wizard," Research your choice. Perform an image search for the character or style that appeals to you the most. You can also peruse books with wizards in them for costume ideas.


For example, maybe you want to be like Harry Potter, or maybe like Merlin, Gandalf, or perhaps your very own kind of wizard.
To be like a young wizard, carry a “book of spells” to appear as if you’re still studying wizardry. To be a mysterious wizard, hide your face with a hood or mask. For a wise wizard, try spectacles and/or attach a fake owl to the shoulder of your costume.;
, To be pretend to be a wizard, you’ll want to look like a wizard! Dress in robes, or deep purple or blue nightgowns. A cape and pointed hat look great with a robe. Your local costume store can probably supply you with a generic wizard outfit, or specific ones from Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings.


One way to make your own wizard costume is to sew stars and/or decorative ribbon details onto a graduation robe.Pretend to be a good wizard by wearing shades of white, and light or metallic colors. You may want to add a sheer cap or cape and a wand with a star on the top. Pretend to be a bad wizard by wearing dark colors and fake, angry-looking eyebrows. Add lightening bolt details to your costume.

, This could be a unique-looking stick you find on your own. Or, you can buy a staff online from websites that sell costumes or wizardry merchandise. On sites like Etsy, you can find cool and unique handmade wands.


Make your own small wand by painting and decorating chopsticks or wooden dowels.Make a large wand using a tree branch or an old cane.

, Guys: Find or make a long beard out of cotton. Girls: Wear make-up that makes you look more magical or mysterious. Put an emphasis on the eyes. Sparkly mascara works great for this.


Other examples of wizard accessories are a walking staff, big ornate rings such as mood rings, a smoking pipe, fake daggers, and pointy shoes.
Wizards are often depicted holding crystal balls. Purchase one online or from a local costume shop. Or, make your own using an empty snow globe ornament from a craft store., Try using clear vials or bottles with corked tops. You can find these at local craft stores. Fill your bottles with things like sparkly beads, fake moss, glitter, and fake worms. Add labels to your bottles, if desired. Use descriptions like “eye of newt” or “jellyfish stingers.”


Pinterest is a useful source for finding tutorials and examples for DIY potion bottles.

, Practice using words related to wizardry. For instance, cauldron, warlock, magic, enchanting and incantation. If you decide to be a wizard like those from Harry Potter, frequently call people ""Muggles,"" which means non-magical folk.For example, find an item such as a rock. Pretend to examine it, then put it in your pocket. Try saying, “This has power. I must save this to use later in my magical cauldron.”

, Reference fantasy and folklore. Make comments about your “pet dragon.”Talk about things like candles, stars, chants and planets.Try asking, “Do you know of any stores that sell jeweled candles? My dragon very much enjoys lighting them with his fiery breath!”
Tell a tall tale. Then follow it up with, “This belief has been passed on from wizard to wizard for many generations.”

, Make up your own fake spells, or use pretend spells from a source of fiction. They could be coherent, or complete nonsense. You may want to use spells that rhyme, since they have a lyrical flow to them.


For example, look up spells used on the TV series Charmed, or the Marvel series Doctor Strange.Make up funny-sounding words to add to your spells. If anyone asks what the words mean, be elusive. Try saying, “I cannot tell you what that word means, or you will transform into a hill of beans.”

, When unexplainable things happen around you, tell people that you made them happen. Or say something like ""Not again! I have to learn to control my powers.""


For example, if an object falls down, or you hear an unidentified noise, try saying, “Now, that wasn’t supposed to happen. I asked for a toad to appear!”

, Make yourself appear shorter by slightly crouching. Occasionally wiggle your fingers as if you’re casting a silent spell. Wizards often act immune to criticism, so if someone is critical or questions your abilities, be aloof.Try saying in an unconcerned tone, “Yes, yes – it’s inborn for humans to doubt.”

, Learn some magic tricks, and practice them. Never reveal the secret to your tricks, to maintain an aura of mystery. For example, you may want to do some easy card tricks, or learn a trick using coins.Practice your tricks in a mirror so that you can watch how the trick will look to an audience.
Try searching Youtube for videos that show how to perform magic tricks.

, Mutter to yourself incoherently. Stop what you’re doing sometimes to stare at an inanimate object, spin in circles, or raise your hands to the sky. Pretend to drink an invisible beverage from an invisible container. Don’t explain what you’re doing or why.

Most RPGs on the market will provide you with a section on how to run it...,
Prepare, prepare, prepare.,
As well as the preparation of the game itself, you'll usually be expected as GM to provide the venue.,
When players first arrive, start getting early arrivals into the game with discussions of character background, what they want out of the game, and what they think of current/past plot lines.,
Starting campaigns is hard.,
If you're indecisive and overly loose in your GMing, your players might start feeling adrift, and pointless, without a plot to follow.,
Now you've got those basics, here's the weirder suggestions from my time spent behind the GM's screen.,
Never tell a player 'no'.,
If someone proposes an action that will dis-rail or bypass your planned story, ask yourself these questions: Can I make another story with this?,
Change things.,
Above all, have fun.",How to Run an RPG," Follow their advice. These guidelines are just additional things, tricks they often don't mention. I'll be glossing over the basic principles that every RPG's GM section always includes, on the assumption that you'll read them there.;
, Even if you're using a pre-made adventure, make sure you've pre-read the story, and know where things are in the reference material. If you're running something you made yourself, get EVERYTHING in one place. Sketch out maps, visual aids, relationship or plot diagrams. Double-check to make sure all the major stuff exists; you can flesh out side characters, other areas, and such during play. Or, my personal favorite, flying by the seat of your pants. Make sure you have an idea of general direction for both the session and adventure, or at very least a general theme. No plan survives first contact with the players. Not intact, at least. No matter how you're running, read and re-read the rules of the basic system. Make cheat-sheets for combat, types of actions, movement... Whatever is going to come into play frequently. Keep things organized.

, Have a table, enough chairs, and good light on hand. Ask players to bring what snacks and drinks they want, and to help clean up afterwards. Have lots of pencils and erasers on hand, scratch paper and spare character sheets. A CD player or laptop with mp3s can be handy, occasionally... But you won't use it as often as you might think. If your group leans towards using visualizations, try to have some miniatures or tokens on hand to represent characters and foes, and some assorted items for walls, doors, tables and the like.

, If this is the first session, character creation will have to happen. Try to get everyone doing this at once, as the discussion this prompts will get personalities jump-started and keep people interested. Once everyone's there and ready, start the game as promptly as possible. Don't let people start wandering right off hand. Open sessions at a high pace, if you can, capturing interest right off hand, and getting people into character.

, Going from creating a character straight to playing them is always going to be a little rough, and it's your job as a GM to keep things running until people settle into their character personas. There are many ways to start a game. Try to avoid the cliches of taverns and mysterious strangers. Don't tell people out-of-hand that their characters already knew each other, unless it was something already discussed in character concept. Better to have most, if not all, first meeting happen during play. It helps define the relationships realistically, and gives a much more interesting time. A good tactic is often to start with each character separated; more work for you, but more rewarding in the end. Over the course of one, maybe two sessions, let them all run into each other. They might even be pitted against each other initially, or working together, but hostile; don't force friendships. Things will develop.

, 'Sandbox' worlds, where they have to find their own stories, can work, but it takes a very rare set of players. Most will just get frustrated and bored. On the other hand, being overly controlling, forcing your players' actions and reactions, will make your players feel railroaded. You can use these feelings for short stretches of games, if they have a valid in-game reason to exist, like a manipulative superior showing up as the villain, but they have to be something that can be stopped. Players will get incredibly frustrated when they can't make their own decisions, and get apathetic and angry, because they're no longer involved in the story.

, Take these with a grain of salt. Some were culled from various games, some are just my own invention.

, This is, basically, improv theatre with dice. A 'no' is a destructive answer, and it interrupts the game's flow. Here are the alternatives:


If it's something you have no problem with them doing, something you feel would be good for the story, just say 'yes'. If this gives one player an advantage, make sure you play fair, though, to avoid feelings of favoritism.
If it's something you're not sure of, that you like, but seems unlikely, tell them 'yes, but'. Qualify it. Tell them it'll take special effort, or they'll only succeed partially, or they can't manage that, but something similar...
If you think it'll unbalance the game, hurt everyone's experience, and make things less fun, tell them 'you can try'. And let them try. They can even roll dice. And they might manage to do something. But at the same time, don't be afraid to tell them in that case that they failed.

, Will it be fun? Will it be more fun than the planned story? Can I pull it off? Will the other players enjoy it? If you answer yes to these questions, then let them do it. If you can get the players to drive the story, it's that much less work for you. Just get a step or two ahead of them by the end to give them a twist or two and a good reward, and let them run with it.

, Avoid altering core mechanics, but major NPCs, points of setting, details of how things work, and politics and machinations should be fair game. The world should be able to surprise the players, avoiding the jaded feeling games can acquire when everyone's read the rulebook and setting, and knows everything. Keep your own notes so your alterations are self-consistent, and don't reveal these to players. Tell each one the information that their character would know. Have fun with this; tell some outright falsehoods that would arise from cultural misunderstandings, and lots of colorings of the truth. Let their information disagree.

, Cultivate your accents and acting skills. Practice your evil chuckle. Be a friend to the players, and cruel fate to their characters. Collaborate with individual players on events centering on their characters, from abduction or major alterations to family issues. Do this for everyone, at one point or another. Each story can get everyone involved, make the featured player feel special, and develop the campaign as a whole, all at once.

Daggers are hard to use for beginners, as they require being very close to possibly more experienced enemies. If you want to try a new thing, use daggers. Scimitars are curved, lightweight, and great for slashing and thrusting. Since scimitars are thinner, it is usually best to avoid strikes rather than block them.

To do a hard block, put the forte of your blade in the path of the opponents strike. Hard blocks cannot thwart thrusts, however.
To do a parry, use the middle of your sword to connect to your opponent's middle or foible. Maintaining this contact, maneuver your enemy's sword off of it's course.
A beat is an exaggerated parry. To do a beat, you club your opponent's sword as hard as possible with your own when they try to strike. If you beat hard enough, you can disarm your enemy.

,


To thrust, hold your sword level, and lunge forward.
To slash, swing your sword over your head, or to one side.
To fight with a two handed sword, you use many of the same techniques, but you have to calculate for slower strikes and blocks, as your sword is heavier.

,,, You need to practice with both hands, so both hands are equal.

, Block and strike at the same time.

, One exception, catching a blade in an ""X"", then scissoring down to strike is a neutral action.

, Just remember, everything you'll see is some form of the basics. If you remember this, you can find ways to beat anyone.

Maintain good etiquette when doubling.",How to Roleplay1," It is essentially the same thing, except that you will be writing the story with at least one other person. When you do text-based roleplaying, you take on the role of a character, and write his or her actions and reactions to other characters and events. Here is an example of what a roleplay might look like:
fanfiction4ever:
Jane was breathless as she hurried to school through the pouring rain. She had forgotten her umbrella at home, and it was too late now to go back and get it. She was soaked and cold.roleplay_queen:
John saw Jane dash across the school yard, and ran over to her. ""Hey, Jane!"" he called, ""Wait up!"" He then pulled out his umbrella, and held it over both their heads. ""Here,"" he said, ""Let's walk to class together.fanfiction4ever:
Jane blushed as John stepped closer to her, so that both of them could fit under the umbrella. She had always had a crush on him, but too afraid of rejection to admit it. ""T-thank you, John,"" she said, and slipped her arm through his.
;
, There are many websites that allow roleplaying. Some of them are entire websites dedicated to roleplaying, while others have roleplaying sub-forums, such as GaiaOnline and Neopets. Pick a site that suits your interests the most. You will be prompted to create an account and log in.


Some websites are geared towards only certain types of roleplays, while others allow a broader spectrum. For example, you may find a site that focuses only on vampire-themed roleplays.
You can play with people you already know, or play with people you don't know. Roleplayers often become best friends!
Wherever you choose to roleplay, be sure to read the rules and respect them. Breaking these rules can result in suspension or even banning.

, The terms might vary depending on where you choose to roleplay, but in general, they are the same. Here are some common terms you might see:


RP: stands for roleplay. You will often see this in search threads.
OC and Canon: ""OC"" stands for ""original character,"" while ""canon"" refers to a character from an existing book, game, or movie, such as Harry Potter, Cloud Strife, or Tony Stark.
Pairing: this refers to two characters in an rp; they interact with each other the most, and often end up in a relationship.
OOC: stands for ""Out of Character."" It is usually followed by a colon to signify the writer him/herself speaking. People use these for comments and questions about the rp.
Literate, Semi-literate, and Advanced-literate: refer the amount of writing expected per post. These terms are arbitrary, as every one has different ideas of what means what. In general, ""semi-lit"" refers to posts that are less than a paragraph, and ""advanced-lit"" refers to posts that are several paragraphs long.

, Besides genre, roleplays fall into different categories: fandom, original, group, and one-on-one. You should choose one that appeals the most to you.


Fandom: an rp based on an existing universe from a book or movie, such as Harry Potter or The Avengers. It can contain both canon and original characters.

AU: stands for ""Alternate Universe."" It is a sub-category of ""Fandom,"" and usually contains some changes, such as reversed genders or the characters are all cats.
Cross-Over: a sub-category of ""Fandom."" It is a combination of two or more fandoms. For example: Harry Potter and Hunger Games.



Original: an rp based on a completely original setting that the roleplayers make up. It can be anything: fantasy, historical, real-life, etc.
Group: an rp between a group of three or more people. They can be fast-paced.
One-on-One: an rp between two people. It is often written as 1x1, and may contain 1 to 2 pairings.

, If you are playing a canon character, then you will not need to create a character for the rp; you should be prepared to portray the canon character as accurately as possible, however. When creating an original character, you will need to make them believable; if you are in a group rp, you may need to submit them to the creator for approval. Consider the following when creating your character:


Physical appearance: Describe your character's hair, eye, skin color, and whatever else is most important to you. This will help other writers to visualize your character. You can also use an image instead, if permitted.
Personality: What is your character like, and how do they act around other characters? You should also think about your character's goals, motives, and desires.
Likes and dislikes: What sorts of things does your character like and dislike/fear? It could be as simple as a love for chocolate and a fear of spiders. It could be as complex as having a hobby (ie: painting) and having a fear (ie: being abandoned).
Skills and talents: Everyone is good at something, and your character should too! It might be a good idea to include something your character is bad at in order to make them more believable.
Backstory: This will root your character in the fictional world. You will need to consider your character's history, family life, occupation, and so forth.

, In the rp world, flawless characters—called ""Mary Sues"" or ""Gary Stues""—have a notorious reputation and are extremely frowned upon. Create a character with both positive and negative traits. For example: your character is smart but too shy to speak up in class and show off her intelligence.


Add a fun quirk or two! Characters that have unusual approaches to solving problems, odd habits, or strange mannerisms can make your character compelling and interesting to others.
If you are creating a character for a fandom rp, try to blend them into the fandom's world as much as possible. Don't make them too similar to an existing character, however!

, Some roleplayers prefer to write using a narrative style, which reads like a typical book. It is the most popular style. Others prefer a screenplay style, which reads like a script. It is most suitable for fast-past roleplays. Here's an example of what a screenplay style roleplay might look like:
fanfiction4ever:
Jane: *running breathlessly through the rain*roleplay_queen:
John: Hey, Jane! Wait up! *runs over and pulls out umbrella* Here *open umbrella* Let's walk to class together.fanfiction4ever:
Jane: *blushes and gets under the umbrella* O-okay!


, This will immerse yourself and fellow roleplayers in the fictional world. At the same time, you'll want to avoid rambling, as this can make the other person lose interest.


Use the five senses: sight, touch, smell, hearing, and taste.
Describe the setting: weather, temperature, location, and important surrounding objects.
Use gestures: what are your characters doing/thinking? How do they walk, talk, and position themselves?

, This is especially important when doubling; don't expect your partner to do all the work. Don't just respond to everything he or she writes; add something new to your posts as well. If your partner is doing all the work, eventually he or she will run out of ideas and get tired or drained.


Rps where two people are contributing to the plot are more interesting than rps where one person is doing all the work.

, In text-based roleplaying, everyone writes out what their character says, thinks, and does, and posts it, usually in a forum. If you are doing a one-on-one roleplay, this may be in an instant messenger or even email. When your turn comes, post your character's part of the story.


Post as soon as you can. If you are unable to post in a timely manner, let your roleplay partner or the group leader know.
Do not pester people for replies. This can be seen as annoying. Wait a week before asking for a reply; sometimes people forget or get busy.
Don't ditch a roleplay without a word. This can be seen as very rude in the roleplay community. If you get tired of the roleplay and don't want to do it anymore, be upfront about it. Politely tell the person you are roleplaying with that you are no longer interested.

, Doubling occurs in one-on-one roleplays, where there are two pairings: your pairing and your partner's pairing. These pairings are often romantic. Each person plays their desired character and a character of their partner's choosing. For example, if you were doing an Avenger's rp, the pairings might be: Steve Rogers x your OC, and Tony Stark x your partner's OC. In this case, you'd be playing your OC and Tony Stark. Your partner would be playing their OC and Steve Rogers. Here is an example of what doubling might look like:
roleplay_queen:
John grinned as Jane slipped her arm through his, and began to lead her to class. ""Hey, Jane,"" he said at last. ""I was wondering if you wanted to come to homecoming this weekend with me."" His heart pounded in his chest as he waited for her reply.
Meanwhile, Mary was hurrying through the halls, trying to get to her class. She was running late again, but wasn't her fault. Elizabeth and her gang had stolen her bag earlier that morning. She got to class moments before the first bell and sat down.fanfiction4ever:
Jane's eyes widened at John's invitation, and she could hardly believe what she was hearing. This was practically a dream come true! ""Oh John!"" she said, ""I would love to!"" And here she thought that John never liked her.
Chris was already sitting at his desk; when he saw Mary enter the classroom, he waved her over, and held up her book bag. He had seen what happened earlier, and managed to get it back from Elizabeth. ""Here,"" he said softly, and gave it to her.


, When to roleplaying, fair is fair. You should give the same amount of attention to both characters that you are playing: your character and the character you are playing for your partner. If you write two paragraphs for your original character, you should write two paragraphs for the other character you are playing (ie: Tony Stark). If you only write two sentences for that other character, you would not be fair to your partner. Just imagine if you only got two sentences back for Steve Rogers!

Ten to fifteen people is ideal for group playing without the board game. Make sure participants are comfortable with playing first. You may reveal some secrets about yourself in this game., Consider avoiding questions that might make people feel uncomfortable or regret playing. For example, topics involving sex, personal attacks, or sensitive subjects.

, Set up chairs, if desired. Leave enough room for some shuffling around inside the circle. Making a circle is not necessary, but it can help keep the focus on the game. Use enough chairs for the total of participants minus one, if you want to have the speaker stand in the center.


If you’re playing the board game, you may want to put pillows or cushions on the floor so that you can play the game either on the floor or at a coffee table.

, Assign a pawn to each player. Open the game board on a flat surface. Shuffle the deck of cards and place them on the appropriate square for them on the game board.


Have the die ready for rolling.

, Your main object should be to have fun, laugh, and learn new things about your fellow players. However, if you’re competitive and trying to win, pick your questions wisely. Come up with statements that you think will penalize a lot of players but keep you safe.Try to think of things you haven’t done that other people most likely have. For example, “I have never climbed a tree.”

, Have everyone roll the die; whoever gets the highest number should go first. Play the game by taking turns, going clockwise around the circle of participants.


If multiple people roll the same highest number, have those people re-roll to determine who will go first.
If you aren’t using die, choose someone to go first at random.

, Pick a card, if applicable. Otherwise, the person making the statement can choose whatever statement they like. Say a true statement out loud. You may choose to have the speaker stand in the middle of the circle, or everyone can remain seated.


For a kids’ game, try saying, “Never have I ever ran a lemonade stand.”
For an adults game, try saying, “I’ve never been in handcuffs.”, Whoever has done what the player announced should take the action. For an adult game, the action is often drinking a shot of liquor. For a family game, the action may be spinning in a circle, dancing or singing. If you’re playing the board game, the action will depend on the card chosen. Advance your pawn on the board, if applicable.Try saying, “I’ve never rolled down a hill.” Everyone who has rolled down a hill should spin in a circle five times.For an added twist, if no one has done what the player announced, everyone can perform the action.

, The speaker should take a seat. Everyone who has done what the speaker mentioned should switch to a new seat.Whoever is left without a seat is the new speaker. Or, if there is only one person who has done what the speaker mentioned, that person is the new speaker.
Optionally – if the new speaker has done what the previous speaker mentioned – the new person standing in the middle can tell the details about what happened before starting the next “I’ve Never.”

, As you go around the circle, each person who has done the announced action should put one finger down. Whoever still has a finger raised at the end of the game wins. Alternately, you can restart the game when someone is eliminated, to keep everyone engaged.This is a faster version of the game and doesn’t require props.
Alternately, you can keep a tally, and/or use a buzzer.

, Use different statements and/or actions to mix things up. Not every statement has to start with “I’ve never” or “Never have I ever.”For example, try saying, “Everyone who likes country music, start dancing!”

, Combine the I’ve Never game with fitness! Make the penalty action a set of exercise repetition.For example, everyone who has done what the speaker announced should do ten burpees, five push-ups, or fifteen sit-ups.

",How to Roleplay on Tumblr," It can be an already established (canon) character from any fandom you enjoy, a canon character with certain aspects altered (AU) or a character of your own creation (OC).


Whether playing an OC, canon or AU character, be certain of your character's backstory before getting started.;
, Generally an an actor who will represent the look and actions of your character although people have been known to use cartoon face-claims particularly for cartoon characters. If you're playing a TV or film character there will probably be a face claim typically used however you are not required to choose them as your character's face claim.

, A common practice is to collect and/or create moving images called gifs that will often be used to demonstrate an action or mood of a character during roleplays.


If you're not sure where to look for gifs try simply searching through the tumblr tag for your chosen actor/character and save any that you think might suit your character.

, Everybody is able to appreciate a good theme and when combined with a select gif or image that represents your character for the sidebar it can make for an intriguing blog that will appeal to potential followers and RP partners.


There are many tumblr users who create themes that are easy to use and install. Be sure to find one that meets anything you might want for your blog i.e. ability to display sidebar image, built in audio player, certain number of side links.

, Once you are set up you will need to find people to roleplay with whether inside or outside of your fandom. If you don't already know some, try searching various character or fandom names followed by either 'rp' or 'roleplay in the tags.


Some roleplayers will write a following starter if you follow them, some won't. Not all roleplayers are multifandom/OC-friendly be sure to read their information pages to check before you try to start anything with them.

, When you start to get followers, write starters (using a gif or a whole paragraph) prompting your characters to meet. You don't have to write one for every new follower and some people may not respond but making an effort to reach out to people is the best form of self-advertisement.

, People will warm to you a bit more if they feel they know you better as a person. Plus many other people on the site are roleplaying to have fun and make friends.

, It's common practice to track your username so that people can tag you in posts/starters they want you to see. And when looking for replies you'll find tagging your own posts with whoever you're roleplaying with invaluable.


Tumblr does not support tracking tags with dashes in them. As such if your username has dashes like ""your-user-name"" use spaces between the words or have them all as one word e.g. your user name/yourusername

Don't be afraid to interact with other people, but don't take the spotlight either.",How to Roleplay2," Many people like to compare live-action roleplaying to playing ""pretend."" That is, you hang out with other people and pretend that you are someone else, such as a vampire or a pirate.

, Some live-action roleplays are action-based, where you fight opponents with boffers (weapons made from foam). Others are story-based, where you do not touch the other characters. Instead, you decide whether you win or lose a battle by rolling dice, playing rock-paper-scissors, or comparing character stats.


Story-based live-action roleplays are also called ""theater-style"" or ""freeform.""
Some live-action meet regularly in a public area, while others meet seldom (ie: once a month or once a year) in a staged area, such as a campground or hotel.

, When you first enter the world of LARPing, you may hear certain terms that are completely new to you. Most of them are pretty self-explanatory, but some might be confusing. Different groups might have different terms for certain things, but the following are the most common:


LARP: stands for ""live-action roleplay.""
Boffer: a foam padded weapon, commonly used in action-based LARPs.
Game master: the person in charge of leading the LARP's story. He or she will be in charge of bringing in new characters, dilemmas, etc. They may also be called a ""Storyteller,"" and are common in story-based LARPs.
NPC: stands for ""non-player character."" They are unavailable to the other players, and are usually played by the game master.
PC: stands for ""player character."" This is the character that you, the LARPer, plays.
Crew: also called ""stagehands."" They help the game master setup the event. Some may also play NPCs.

, They will vary depending on which group you join. For example, action-based LARPs often have rules against where you can or can't hit a person with a boffer (ie: the head). Story-based LARPs, on the other hand, often have no-touching rules. Breaking these rules may result in disciplinary action, such as a temporary ban or point deduction.


Many LARPs require you to be in character. You have to indicate when you are not in character. How you do this may vary from group to group.

, Some types of LARPs may have a character sheet for you to fill out, complete with stats like strength, luck, agility, intelligence, etc. Other types of LARPs only require a name and a brief backstory for your character.


Some LARPs require costumes. When creating a character, you might want to keep this in mind, especially if you plan on making the costume yourself.

, Some LARPs require you to be in costume at all times, while others do not. In either case, the costume will help make your character more believable, and the world more engaging. Many people find it easier to get into character while they are in costume.


Many action-based LARPs only require costumes for the actual game or battles. They do not require costumes during training sessions.

, Typically, you would be in-character when the LARP is taking place; you would be out-of-character before and after the LARP, such as when plans are being made and points are being tallied. If you need to get out of character, such as during an emergency, remember to indicate accordingly; again, how you indicate will depend on the group you join, as they all have different rules.

, Most LARPs will have websites telling you where their roleplays take place. Many LARPs have multiple groups in multiple locations, all playing the same game—that is, they use the same character types and rules. If you find a LARP that interests you, look it up and see if it is playing near your city or town. If they don't, then see if you can register a group of your own, and start your own game.


Some LARPs take place at anime, comic book, or science fiction and fantasy conventions. Check the schedule to see if there is one planned. Most cons will post their schedules ahead of time on their website.

, Some LARPs take place in public areas, such as a park, and last only a few hours. Others may span over the course of a weekend, and take place at a campground, forest, or lake. Some of these longer LARPs may have accommodation for the players, such as cottages or hotels, but others won't. In these cases, you will need to pack for the trip, and bring items such as: tents, sleeping bags, food, medications, change of clothes, etc.


A costume and prop repair kit would be highly recommended for any weekend-long LARP session. Even the sturdiest costumes and props break, and not every place will have a repair station.

, LARPing is all about interaction. Once a session starts, you will walk around and talk with other players, while in character. This means that if you are playing a 100-year-old vampire, you will be using lots of Victorian-era mannerisms. Don't be afraid to go out of your shell, but don't take the spotlight and try to be the center of attention. Let other players talk as well!!


If this is a combat-based LARP, have your boffer ready, because people might start charging at you. There is not much chatting or ""acting"" in combat-based LARPs once a battle starts.
There is no real winner or loser in a story-based LARP, but the last one standing is the winner in a combat-based LARP. Play hard!

Choose a roleplay whose focus appeals to you.,
Understand the terminology.,

Understand the basics.,
Be descriptive but only to a certain point.",How to Roleplay3," Many tabletop games focus on the story, but they also focus on building your character. You will typically sit around a table with a group of people, and take turns describing what your character does.


One of the most popular tabletop roleplay games is Dungeons and Dragons.


, Typically, you can find a game to join online or in your local gaming/hobby shop. Some games require you to be there in person, while others can be played online.


There are lots of different settings and genres, ranging from fantasy, to science-fiction, to historical, to horror. Some may have other themes too, such as steampunk or western.There are lots of game guides and rule books available online, in bookstores, and at libraries. You can always pick one of these up, and start a game with your friends.

, Some group meet regularly, while others meet occasionally. This can be as often as once a week to a seldom as once a month or only a few times a year. Also, some games are lighthearted and easy-going, while others are very serious and focused.If you are just starting out, a lighthearted, easy-going play style might be the best for you.
If you are very busy with work and/or school, a group that meets weekly night be too much for you, but a group that meets monthly might be perfect.

, Some roleplays will focus more on story or setting, while others will focus more on battle and combat. If you are a very active person, a story-focused roleplay might bore you. On the other hand, if you enjoy a good story, a combat-focused roleplay might not be engaging enough for you. There are three main types of roleplays:Game-oriented roleplays focus on leveling characters via challenges. The battles and monsters become more complex as the characters gain more power.
Simulation-oriented roleplays focus on exploring the setting, genre, or theme. Combat tends to be dangerous in these games.
Narrative-oriented games focus on how a character's decision affects the story. These games tend to give players more control over setting and story.

, Every tabletop roleplay will have its own unique set of terms, but there are some terms that remain consistent across all the different games and genres. The most common ones are:.


Game master: the in charge of the roleplay. They are the narrator, and lead the story. ""Game master"" may also be written as ""GM"" or ""Gamemaster.""
Game mechanics: the rules of the roleplay.
Adventure: the game, but limited to a single story or plot set by the GM.
Campaign: a series of adventures. It typically follows or continues the story and includes the same characters from previous sessions.

, How detailed your character is will depend on what game you are playing. Some games will give you complete freedom during character creation, while others will require you to add stats. Some games will also limit what stats you can use based on what class or race you pick for your character.


Depending on the game you play, you may have to use the 20-sided die to determine your character's stats.

, After you have created your character, the GM will establish the plot and setting. The players will then take turns describing their characters' actions, and the GM will then decide on the consequences of those actions. Sometimes, a 20-sided die will be used to determine the outcome. For example, if your character comes across a treasure chest, the GM may have you roll the die to determine whether or not your character succeeds in opening the chest., For the most part, you will be in charge of describing your character's actions, and the GM will be in charge of describing the results of your character's actions. He or she will also be in charge of describing any scene changes. For example, if your character enters a dungeon, the GM may describe the dungeon. He or she may even throw in a monster for your character to battle.

, Potential group members will want to know whether your sessions fit into their schedules and what kind of transportation they will require. While your group may ultimately decide to meet elsewhere than where you initially decide, you cannot count on them providing a playing space. It is your responsibility to ensure there is at least one option available., Roleplaying games are highly social, and you're going to be spending a lot of time in the company of your group members.

Get to the Eldergleam Tree.,
Retrieve the Eldergleam Sap.,
Take the sap back to Danica.",How to Retrieve Eldergleam Sap in Skyrim," Head to the center of Whiterun where you’ll find a large withering tree. At its base is a woman in brown hooded robe. This is Danica. Talk to her, and she’ll tell you that in order for you to retrieve the Eldergleam Sap, you’ll need a special weapon called Nettlebane—the only weapon that can be used to extract the sap.;
, Danica will tell you that Nettlebane can be found in a place called Orphan Rock. Exit Whiterun and travel straight south, passing Riverwood, towards Helgen. Once in Helgen, travel a few meters east until you find a large stone with a few tents on it. This is Orphan Rock.

, Climb the rocks and kill the witches you’ll see on top. These enemies have low life points and can easily be defeated using any weapon you may have. Once dead, search their bodies to retrieve the Nettlebane.

, Head back to Whiterun and give Danica the blade. She’ll tell you that she doesn’t want to touch the Nettlebane, and instead, tell you to go to the Eldergleam Sanctuary to retrieve the sap yourself.

, Head to the northeastern part of Skyrim to the city of Windhelm, and from there, travel straight south, crossing a river and passing the Broken Limb Camp. You’ll eventually find a large hole in the ground—this is the entrance to the sanctuary.

, Open your item inventory and equip the Nettlebane. Once you have the blade in your hands, drop down to the bottom of the sanctuary through the hole in the ground, and make your way to the largest tree at the center of the cave.


The path will be blocked by large tree roots. Simply attack these roots using Nettlebane, and it should move out of the way, clearing the path.

, Stand close to the tree and an “interaction” prompt will appear on the game screen. Press the corresponding button on your controller as prompted on the game screen and your character will retrieve the sap from the tree.

, Travel back to Whiterun and talk to Danica Pure-Spring for the last time. Give her the Eldergleam Sap, and she will use it to revive the Gildergreen tree at the Kynareth temple.

Simplify the question and your options.,
Determine where you will keep the 4 gallons of water.,
Know that, like all good riddles, you have everything you need for a solution.,
Realize that this is, at heart, a simple math problem.",How to Solve the Water Jug Riddle from Die Hard 31," Setting the movie aside for the moment, think of the riddle in its most basic terms. What do you know, what's your goal, and what are your options? A simpler way to look at the riddle might be:
You have two empty water jugs in your hands. One holds 3 gallons of water, the other holds 5 gallons of water. You need to use these two jugs to measure exactly 4 gallons of water. You have an unlimited amount of water to do so.


 ;
, In order to measure out your 4 gallons, you need to put it somewhere. As John McClane rightly deduces, you couldn't possibly fit it in the 3-gallon jug, which means the right answer must involve getting the right amount of water in the 5-gallon jug.

, The solution does not involve bringing in another jug, or eyeballing the water levels perfectly, or finding fractions of jugs. You have two jugs and an unlimited supply of water. How can you use just those things to get to 4 gallons? More specifically, how can you use 3 and 5 to get to 4?


Unlimited water means you can use or pour out as much as you want.
You are not able to guess exactly how much water is in the jug unless you fill it all the way up.

, Ignore the water and the jugs for a moment if you are still stuck. How can you add or subtract 3's and 5's to get to 4? This is really all you are doing; the numbers just happen to represent gallons. Adding water or dumping it out is really just addition and subtraction.

Transfer the 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water into the 5-jug to end up with 4 gallons (15.1 L).",How to Solve the Water Jug Riddle from Die Hard 32," There will be, of course, 5 gallons in the 5-jug. You must fill all the gallons up to the top, otherwise you don't actually know how much you have.

, You're left with 3 gallons in the 3-jug and 2 gallons in the 5-jug.

, You're left with nothing in the 3-jug and 2 gallons in the 5-jug.

, You're left with 2 gallons in the 3-jug. And nothing in the 5-jug.

, You now have 2 gallons in the 3-jug and 5 in the 5-jug. This means that there is 1 gallon (3.8 L) of space left in the 3-jug.

, Fill up the last gallon of space in the 3-jug with the water from the 5-jug. This leaves you with 3 gallons in the 3-jug, and 4 gallons in the 5-jug., You now have 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water.

, You now have nothing in the 3-jug, and 3 gallons (11.4 L) in the 5-jug.

, You now have 3 gallons (11.4 L) in the 3-jug and 3 gallons in the 5-jug.

, You now have 1 gallon (3.8 L) in the 3-jug and 5 gallons (18.9 L) in the 5-jug. This is because, in the last step, you only had 2 gallons (7.6 L) of space left over, so you could only pour 2 gallons.

, You now have nothing in the 3-jug and 1 gallon in the 5-jug

, You now have 3 gallons (11.4 L) in the 3-jug and 1 in the 5-jug.

, Simply pour over your three gallons into the 5-jug, which only had 1 gallon (3.8 L) in it previously. 1+3=4, and a successfully defused bomb."

.,
Choose the right stats.,
Prepare your Spells Carefully: Wizards are highly limited in their volume of spells compared to all other classes.,
Expand your Spellbook: Unlike sorcerers, wizards can know an unlimited number of spells, as long as they have enough spellbooks.,
Cast Spells Cautiously: The wizard who casts spells at every opportunity is the wizard who dies first.,
Use Scrolls Liberally: Scrolls are probably the best items in the game for wizards except for staffs.,
Craft Magic Items: One advantage wizards have over sorcerers is that they are much better suited to crafting magic items.,
Have Mundane Items: If you are out of spells, you will need to fight with hands.,
Finished.

",How to Play Wizard in Dungeons and Dragons," Choose a race with an Intelligence bonus. In 3.5, elves and humans take control while eladrins are more useful in 4e. A high intelligence score is compulsory for a wizard because that ability governs his spell casting.;
, Intelligence ranks first for a wizard, then Dexterity/Constitution, then Wisdom, then Strength and lastly Charisma.

, Choose the spells you think you will need most. For example, if you are going to raid a goblin's fortress, preparing a magic missile is probably a better idea than comprehend languages, unless you plan on interrogating the evil goblin chieftain, who only speaks Goblin.

, If the Arch-Mage of Bellfield, or whoever, is in town, you might ask him/her to allow you to copy some spells from their spellbook. They might charge you a fee, but most wizards, especially those of a higher level than you, will be happy to allow you to.

, If you're going against just one opponent, fireball isn't the best spell. Sometimes you might just not cast a spell at all. Having a crossbow to assist your companions is a great way to refrain from spell casting while still feeling as though you are in the game.

, Without expending a spell slot, you can cast any spell on the scroll as long as it is of a level you can cast. Even if the scroll is above the highest level you can cast on your own you still may be able to use it. You must make a caster level check with a Difficulty Class (DC) of the scroll's caster level +1. This helps conserve spell slots, and they're pretty cheap.

, For one, their near unlimited selection of spells means that almost no magic item is out of reach of the high-level wizard to craft. And even low-level wizards can craft magic items. Wizards get Scribe Scroll as an automatic feat at first level.

, So have a quarterstaff, a dagger and maybe a crossbow with you. These items can also be use out of combat. How can you cut ropes without daggers, or measure water without a quarterstaff?

If you're at a job interview, realize that they want to hear your reasoning.",How to Solve Logic Puzzles," Typically, these have a description or a list of facts that describes a group of people, or houses, or other objects. The question usually has to do with matching two categories together, or listing the order a group is placed in. Many books and websites that contain collections of logic puzzles use this type of puzzle.


Here's an example problem: Three friends named Anna, Brad, and Caroline agree to bring one dessert each to a birthday party. Each friend is wearing a different color shirt. Anna wears a blue shirt. The person who brought brownies couldn't find her red shirt today. Brad didn't bring any dessert at all, which made the person wearing a yellow shirt irritated. Which person brought the ice cream?
The example question, like all logic puzzles of this type, asks you to match two categories together. You start out knowing the names of several people and the names of several desserts, but you don't know who brought which dessert. Using the clues in the description, you need to figure out how to match each person to a dessert until you know who brought the ice cream. There's actually a third category, shirt color, which should help you get to your answer.

Note: skip to Using a Grid if the puzzle already comes with a grid set up. Skip to Solving Other Logic Puzzles if your puzzle does not fit this description.;
, Sometimes, the puzzle will already give you a list of names, colors, or whatever other basic information makes up the puzzle. Often, you'll have to read the puzzle carefully and make several lists yourself. Keep an eye out for the word ""each"": that often tells you which categories are important. For instance, ""each person brought a different dessert"" tells you that you need a list of people and a list of desserts.


Write each list separately. When the puzzle mentions a name, add it to a list of names. When the puzzle mentions a color, add it to a separate list of colors.
Each list should have the same number of items once you've finished. If a list is too short, reread the puzzle carefully for more items.
Some tricky puzzles will give you hints about what someone doesn't have, such as ""Brad didn't make a dessert."" In this case, you should add ""none"" to the list of desserts, which should make it the same length as the other lists.

, Write a vertical column on the left hand side of the paper, with every item you wrote down on a list on a separate line. Keep each list together and separate them with a thick line.


For instance, let's say you have three lists. Names: Anna, Brad, Caroline; Desserts: brownies, ice cream, none; and Color of Shirts: red; blue, yellow. Write a vertical list in this order: Anna; Brad; Caroline; (draw a thick line here); brownies; ice cream; none; (draw a thick line here); red; blue; yellow.

, Write the lists again across the top of the page, in a horizontal line this time. Keep them in the same order, and separate lists with thick lines as before. In our example, write Anna; Brad; Caroline; (thick line here); brownies; ice cream; none; (thick line here); red; blue; yellow across the top.


Once you're more familiar with this system, you can get away with not writing every list in both places. We will be using this grid to match items in the vertical list (on the left) to items in the horizontal list (at the top), and sometimes you don't need to match every item. If you've never used this method before, stick with these instructions

, Add pen or pencil lines to your graph paper so the grid is clear. Each word on the left should have a row to itself, and each word on the top should have a column to itself. Make the thick lines dividing lists extend all the way across the grid, keeping them much thicker and more noticeable than the other lines.

, The thick lines between lists should divide your grid into several sections (nine in our example). Each section is a comparison of one list on the left and one list on the top. Follow these instructions to cross off sections you don't need, either using a large X or by scribbling over it. Be careful not to cross the thick lines into another section.


If the list to the left of a section and the list above a section are the same, cross it out. You'll never need to compare the list ""Anna, Brad, Caroline"" to the list ""Anna, Brad, Caroline"" – you already know that Anna is Anna.
Cross out duplicate sections. For instance, the section that compares ""Anna, Brad, Caroline"" on the left and ""red, blue yellow"" on the top is the same as the section that compares ""red, blue, yellow"" on the left and ""Anna, Brad, Caroline"" on the top. Cross off one of these duplicate sections so you only have one to pay attention to. It doesn't matter which you cross off.

, Now that you have the grid set up, you can use it to solve your puzzle. The basic idea is to use the clues in the puzzle to rule out certain combinations by placing an ""X"" or other mark in the square of the grid that represents that combination. See the next part for more information.

, Keep in mind what you're trying to solve for before you begin. If you forget what you're looking for, you could get carried away and keep solving additional parts of the puzzle after you've already found the solution.


Occasionally, a puzzle cannot be fully solved, meaning you won't be able to fill the entire grid. You should still be able to answer the question it asks.

, Start with one of the easiest clues, that gives you a simple fact matching two pieces of information together. For instance, ""Anna is wearing a blue shirt."" Find the row of your grid labeled ""Anna"", and follow it until you get to a square underneath the column labeled ""blue"". Make a circle in this square to show that Anna and the blue shirt are connected.


If you can't find that square, search the other way around. For instance, find the row labeled ""blue"" and the column labeled ""Anna"", instead of the other way around.
Don't start with a clue that tells you something that doesn't apply, such as ""Anna doesn't wear a red shirt."" While that's a useful clue that should be marked with an ""X"", this method will assume you started with a clue that gives positive information.

, Your grid should be divided into sections by thick lines that separate the contents of one list (such as names) from another list (such as colors). Next to the square you just circled, use X marks to cross off the other squares in that row and column. Do not cross the border to another section.


In our example, the section that has the clue you just circled compares the names of people to the colors of their shirts. The squares we're crossing off are the combinations we've ruled out, which include Brad or Caroline wearing a blue shirt, and Anna wearing a red or yellow shirt. (Typically, the introduction will tell you that each item can only be matched to one item in each other category.)

, If the puzzle gives you any more straightforward pieces of information that pair two items together, find the square that connects them and put a circle in it as described above. Cross off any other squares in the same row or column, but only within that section of your grid.


If your puzzle gives you clues about what doesn't match, such as ""Anna doesn't wear a red shirt"", you should put an X in that column. However, since you haven't found a positive match, you should not cross out any other squares.

, Let's say you continue to fill out clues until you've learned (using X marks) that Brad is not wearing a blue or yellow shirt. If there is only one other square in that row and inside that section, that square is the only possibility left. In our example, you should circle the square that shows Brad is wearing a red shirt. Remember to cross off any other squares in that column or row.

, Some clues mention items in three or more categories. For instance: ""Brad didn't bring any dessert at all, which made the person wearing a yellow shirt irritated."" There are actually two clues hidden inside this sentence:Brad did not bring a dessert. Put a circle in the Brad-none square.
The person wearing a yellow shirt is not Brad. Put an X in the Brad-yellow square.

, Pronouns such as ""he"" or ""she"" are easily overlooked, but the puzzle maker may be giving you an additional clue.Assume that typically male names belong to men, and that typically female names belong to women. If the clue says ""The person who brought brownies couldn't find her red shirt today."" then you know the person who brought brownies is female, and you should assume for the sake of a puzzle that they have a typical female name.


If you're solving a puzzle from another country, look up the names to find out whether they are male or female. Puzzle books that are printed more than 20 years ago will sometimes contain names that were once female, but have now become male (or vice versa).

, Sometimes a puzzle involves days of the week, houses in a row, or some other list with a particular order. These will often have clues such as ""The green house comes before the black house."" This may seem useless if you don't know where the black house is, but there are actually two clues in this sentence by itself:


The green house comes before another house, so it can't be the last one.
The black house comes after another house, so it can't be the first one.

, The puzzle can get trickier if one of your lists is the amount of time someone takes.For instance, perhaps you know that a group of people raced a mile and finished in 6, 8, 15, and 25 minutes. If you have a clue like ""Marcus finished more than 5 minutes after the person ahead of him,"" you will have to consider each time and think about whether it makes sense. Here's how to work out this example:


Marcus can't be the one who ran the mile in 6 minutes, no one was ahead of him. Cross out the Marcus-6 square.
Marcus can't be the one who ran in 8 minutes, because that time is less than 5 minutes behind the one before it. Cross out the Marcus-8 square.
Either the 15 or 25 minute times would work for this clue. You'll have to wait until more squares are crossed off before you can figure out which time was Marcus's.

, By now, you've probably discovered several pairings, and you can use each one to fill our more of your chart. Here's an example, going back to our original problem without anything involving time or numbers:


Let's say you've discovered that Caroline wears a yellow shirt. Check the yellow shirt column or row for information in other sections.
Let's say you notice on your chart that the person with a yellow shirt did not bring ice cream. Because you know that person is Caroline, you can also cross out the square that connects Caroline and ice cream.
Check Caroline's row or column too and transfer information the same way to the yellow shirt column or row.

, Many puzzle writers try to trick you, and there may be clues that you don't notice until you've read them several times. Sometimes, writing them out yourself on index cards and shifting the order can help you look at them in a different light. A friend who hasn't been working on the puzzle might see something you didn't notice.

, Remember to check your grid every so often to make sure you filled out all the squares you can. If a section has a row or column with every square crossed off except one, put a circle in that empty square. Whenever a square has a circle in it, you can cross off every other square in that section that lines up in the same row or column.


If a row or column within a section has every square crossed off, or more than one square with a circle in it, there was probably a mistake made along the way and you may need to start over.

, Switch to a different color ink, or if you're solving a puzzle online, print it out and work on the copy. Make one guess by putting a circle or an X in an empty square.Be sure to write down this guess so you will remember it. Make a guess that will let you cross off or circle additional squares. This will usually lead to a chain reaction, and either solve the puzzle or end up with an inconsistency, such as ""Brad wears a red shirt and Brad wears a blue shirt"".


If an inconsistency occurs, your guess must have been wrong. Go back to what the chart looked like before you made your guess, and make the opposite one. Always keep track of when you made your guess with a new copy or a different color ink so it's easy to reverse if the guess was wrong.

, Once you've answered the question the puzzle posed, look at the clues and see if your chart makes sense with each one. It should only take a few minutes to check each answer and notice any mistakes. Unfortunately, if there is a mistake, you'll probably need to begin again, since it is difficult to backtrack with this kind of puzzle. Otherwise, congratulations! You've solved the puzzle.


If you got the answer without filling out your entire chart, you may not be able to check every clue. As long as your chart doesn't contradict the clues you can check, you are probably correct.

, Many logic problems try to distract you or lead you down the wrong path. Don't follow the first train of thought that enters your head; look at each word and see if there's a simple answer that's easy to miss.For example: ""A cell phone has fallen down a one foot (30cm) hole. How do you retrieve it? You have a wheel of cheese, three chicken feathers, and a flute."" The question is designed to get you thinking about how to use bizarre objects in a creative way, but consider each word and you'll notice the hole is shallow enough to reach down and pick up the cell phone.

, Some questions will fool you by appearing too easy, when they're actually more complicated than they seem. You can avoid most of these trick questions by pausing and thinking the problem through before you make a snap decision.


For instance, ""A wind is blowing from the east, but you are facing the south side of a tree. Which way are the leaves blowing?"" If you don't stop to think, you might have heard ""east wind"" and automatically answer ""east"". However, the wind is blowing from the east, so the leaves are actually blowing west.

, Many logical reasoning test questions provide you with a list of statements and ask you what you can deduce from them, usually with multiple choice answers to choose from.If the answer is not obvious to you, take the time to go through each option in turn and weight it against each statement. If one answer contradicts a statement, or you can't see how to deduce that answer from that given information, cross that answer off.


For timed tests, if you cannot narrow it down to exactly one answer (or however many the instructions request), you may need to take a guess and move on. Make a note on your notepaper to go back to that question at the end if you have time.

, If you are preparing for the logical reasoning section of an exam, find a practice booklet or take practice tests online. This is the best way to prepare, since you will become familiar with the exact type of logic problems they use.


There are many practice tests available online for free for any major standardized school exam. If you can't find your exact exam, search for practice logic tests that match your education level.

, If you are asked a strange logic question or out-of-the-blue question at a job interview, the interviewer is not looking for the ""right answer"". He or she is giving you an opportunity to demonstrate your reasoning ability.Explain every step of your logic, and feel free to give multiple answers or assume extra information as long as you make every detail clear to your interviewer. A complicated answer that takes into account several possibilities will look better than a short, correct answer that doesn't show any logical reasoning ability.


If the question doesn't give you enough information, make an assumption or estimate and state it clearly. For instance, say ""Let's say the skyscraper is 100 stories tall and has 20 windows on each story"" or ""First, I'll assume everyone is following the speed limit, and then I'll consider what changes if some people are traveling faster.""

Understand that sometimes riddles will try to trick you.",How to Solve Riddles," There are two basic types of riddles: enigmas and conundrums. Both are often framed as a dialogue between the riddle asker (often the riddle’s solution) and the riddle answerer.


Enigmas are posed as problems using metaphorical, allegorical, or associational language that require creativity and experience to answer. For example: “If the sun sets, a flower-garden; but if you look at it after dawn, an empty garden. What is it?” (Answer: the sky.)Conundrums are posed as questions that incorporate puns in the question, the answer, or both. For example: “What flowers can be found between the nose and chin?” (Answer: Tulips/”Two lips”);
, Most riddles deal with very familiar topics. Their difficulty comes in how those topics are described. Riddles often create a pattern of associations in order to direct you to the answer.


For example, a popular riddle from J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit goes: “Thirty white horses on a red hill, / First they champ, / Then they stamp, / Then they stand still.”This riddle uses familiar ideas (horses, hills) to figuratively express the answer (in this case, “teeth.”)

, Seemingly logical associations may really be misdirection. The correct answer may be so obvious that you initially dismiss it.


Red herrings are a common form of misdirection through association, as seen in this riddle: “A green man lives in the green house. A blue man lives in the blue house. A red man lives in the red house. Who lives in the white house?” The immediate answer, given the pattern set up, would be “a white man,” but the “White House” is a red herring: the President of the United States lives in the White House!
A traditional African riddle asks: “How do you eat an elephant?” (Answer: one bite at a time.) This riddle is a good example of an answer being hidden in plain sight.
Other “riddles” are not true riddles at all. For example, this traditional Yiddish riddle asks: “What hangs on a wall, is green, wet, and whistles?” The answer is “a herring” because you can hang a herring on a wall and paint a herring green. If the herring has been freshly painted, it is wet. The joke is that it really doesn’t whistle -- there’s intentionally no solution to this riddle., Solving puzzles requires you to combine what you already know with new information from the puzzle. Just like riddles, puzzles ask you to use existing knowledge and context clues to come up with an original, often tricky answer.Puzzles can help you learn to recognize patterns and order.Puzzle games such as Tetris, as well as traditional jigsaw puzzles, require you to look at a situation in multiple ways to figure out the best solution. This process transfers well into solving riddles, too.
Specific types of puzzles and games are best at developing specific types of skills. Thus, if you do a lot of crossword puzzles, you’ll probably get very good at crossword puzzles, but you may not see equivalent gains in other areas. It’s helpful to play a variety of games instead of focusing on only one type., The more you repeat a certain type of task, the less effort your brain needs to expend to perform it. Regularly alternating the types of games you play will help keep your brain from taking shortcuts., For example, you could read a complex news story and then write a short summary that boils down all the ideas into a few key ideas. Research suggests that this will help you look at the “big picture” as well as the details, a skill that also comes in handy when solving riddles.Rephrasing ideas into your own words may also help you develop linguistic flexibility and improve memory. It’s easier to remember ideas when you’ve taken the time to paraphrase them, because your brain has had to work to structure the ideas so that it understands them.

, You may find it helpful to start with some riddles for which you already know the answer. There are many collections of riddles online and in books that you can use to practice on.

, Riddles tend to assume that the answer should already be known; part of the fun of a riddle is seeing whether you can stump someone by asking them about something they don’t know that they know. Although the wording itself may be tricky, the solution is usually something familiar.


For example, a famous enigma in Sophocles’ play Oedipus the King asks, “What goes on four feet in the morning, two feet at noon, and three feet in the evening?” The answer is “a person”: a baby crawls when it is young (morning), walks upright when it is an adult (noon), and has to use a cane when it is old (evening)., With the Oedipus enigma, a good place to start might be the “feet,” since they’re repeated throughout the riddle. What has four feet? What has two feet? What has three feet?


What has four feet? Many animals have four feet, so that’s a possible answer. Tables and chairs also have four feet, and they’re common things too, so keep those in mind.
What has two feet? People seem an obvious choice here, since humans are familiar and they have two feet. Chairs and tables don’t have two feet, so they’re probably not the answer.
What has three feet? This is the tricky part. Animals don’t usually have three feet unless one has been taken away. However, if the animal started with four feet and then went to two feet, it wouldn’t re-grow a third foot. That means that we’re probably looking at the third foot as a kind of tool: something that has been added.
What uses tools? A person is the most familiar answer, so this might be the target.

, We only get one verb in this enigma, “goes.” So we know whatever the solution is, it’s capable of going somewhere.


This might mean that it goes because something else makes it go (like a car), so don’t make up your mind just yet. Maintaining an open mind is crucial for solving riddles.

, The other information in the Oedipus enigma is the problem of time. The riddle gives you “morning,” “noon,” and “evening” as the times when the actions happen.


Because the riddle begins in the morning and ends in the evening, it seems likely that the riddle is asking about something that happens across the progress of time from beginning to end.
Be careful to avoid over-literal thinking when considering riddles. They are almost always figurative; “noon” might not mean “12:00 PM” so much as the “middle” of something.

, Now you can begin narrowing down the possible solutions by eliminating what you know doesn’t work.


Chairs and tables can’t “go” on their own feet. That makes them unlikely solutions.
A person has multiple feet, they can “add” more feet by using tools like canes and crutches, and they can “go” somewhere on their feet. Even if you don’t quite know how the feet work together with time yet, “person” seems like a solid solution.

, Some riddles require creative math skills, such as this riddle: “A barrel of water weighs 50 pounds. What must you add to it to make it weigh 35 pounds?” (Answer: a hole.)


Although both enigmas and conundrums often ask the riddle in the form of a question, enigmas are often more complex problems, while conundrums may ask a simple question.

, With a challenging riddle, it may be helpful to break down the riddle into parts, as demonstrated in Part 2.


While breaking down a riddle into parts and considering multiple possible solutions may seem awkward or clunky at first, it will get much faster and easier with practice.

, One of the most important tactics when listening to or reading a riddle is to not jump to conclusions. To solve a riddle, you will need to consider both the literal and the potential meanings of the words.


For example, this riddle asks: “What gets wetter and wetter the more it dries?” (Answer: a towel.) Even though the actions seem contradictory, a towel does dry things and get wet as it dries those things.

, Try to think of different ways to interpret the clues the riddle gives. Enigmas in particular are often very figurative, meaning they will use words with a literal meaning to convey something metaphorical.


For example, this riddle asks: “What has golden hair and stands in the corner?” The answer is a broom: the “golden hair” is the yellow straw of a traditional straw broom, and it “stands” in the corner when it isn’t being used.

, This is particularly common with riddles that are written to sound like they are asking for an inappropriate or explicit answer. The possibility of multiple answers allows for a laugh from both parties.


The goal of a trick riddle is to get you to give the most “obvious” (and also usually most explicit) answer. For example, there are several answers to this riddle: “What four-letter word ending in K means ‘intercourse’?” In order to give the “right” answer (“talk”), you must look past the most common assumptions and think more flexibly.

, After repeated examination of the portrait, Ib will realize that there's a tiny number written on the pure white canvass.

, The number will be in red, so write it down in red marker if you must, just don't forget the number and its corresponding color.

, The red doll is in the upper-right side of the room. Once you examine it and another red doll will fall from the ceiling.

, Ib will tell you that there's a number on the clothes. The number will be written in green; take note of the color and number.

, To do this, go to the upper-left corner of the area and enter the door you see at the end of the hallway.

, You need to find which painting is telling the truth. Let's start from the right.


Talk to the one wearing a red dress and she'll say that she agrees with the one in yellow. If you talk to the one wearing a yellow shirt, he'll tell you that the one wearing white is telling the truth.
Talk to the girl wearing white and she'll tell you to stand in front of the statue, head 2 steps east and south 2 steps. Unfortunately since the paintings are telling you that she's telling the truth, she's obviously telling a lie.
Talk to the painting with a blue tank on. He will say that the only one telling the truth is green, and green will give you further directions. But since they're agreeing with each other, they too are lying.
Talk to the last portrait, which is the one in brown. This is the only painting that has been ignored by all other paintings, and it's also the only one that tells the truth. Brown will tell you to stand in front of the statue then go 4 steps east and 2 steps north.

, You will see a statue and tiles on the floor once you enter the door that's in the middle of the 6 portraits. Stand in front of the statue then go 4 steps east and 2 steps north.

, Take note of the blue number that you'll find underneath the tile you landed on.

, The door is located just past the hanging dolls.

, You'll be prompted to enter a code on the keypad. The only clue you have is X*X+X. You will notice that each X is a different color, either blue, red, or green.

, Replace each X with the number that matches it’s color (remember that each number you found had different colors), then calculate the equation.


For example, if blue = 5, red = 8, and green = 20, then our calculation will be 5 x 5 + 20 = 45.

, If your answer is correct, the door will open.

Look for rows or columns that can only be made with one combination of digits.,
Look for cells that can only take one digit after considering both their row and column restrictions.,
Find the maximum and minimum digits that could be in any row or column.,
Compare these restrictions with those in the crossing rows.,
If a row or column must contain a certain digit, look for where in that row or column it could go.

,
Continually reevaluate these steps as you discover new information.",How to Solve Kakuro," You'll still have to somehow determine the correct order, but knowing exactly which digits appear in that row is a great start.


Triangular numbers: 3 in 2 cells, 6 in 3, 10 in 4, 15 in 5, 21 in 6, 28 in 7, 36 in 8, and 45 in 9.
Triangular numbers plus one: 4 in 2, 7 in 3, 11 in 4, 16 in 5, 22 in 6, 29 in 7, and 37 in 8.
45 minus triangular numbers: 45 in 9, 44 in 8, 42 in 7, 39 in 6, 35 in 5, 30 in 4, 24 in 3, and 17 in 2
44 minus triangular numbers: 43 in 8, 41 in 7, 38 in 6, 34 in 5, 29 in 4, 23 in 3, and 16 in 2.;
, For example, suppose a 23 in 3 intersects a 28 in 7. The 23 in 3 can only be 6 + 8 + 9. The 28 in 7 can only be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7. The only digit in common is a 6, so that must be in the intersection.

, The triangular numbers are again critical for this step. For example, there are several ways to get 27 in 4, but none of them can use a 1 or a 2 (since the maximum for the other 3 digits is 7 + 8 + 9 = 24) and all need a 9 (since 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26).

, For example, if the above 27 in 4 crossed a 7 in 3, we could conclude that the cell in the intersection contained a 4. That also implies that the 27 is 4 + 6 + 8 + 9.

,, Although you might not be able to say much about a 20 in 5 initially, once you learn that that row contains a 9, then it looks like a 11 in 4 and therefore must be 20 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 9.

Break up the anagram.,
Put letters together in common pairings.,
Separate vowels and consonants.,
Pick out prefixes and suffixes.",How to Solve Anagrams Effectively1," First, write down all of the letters in a different pattern. You won’t be able to find a new phrase or word if you keep staring at the same one that’s already in front of you. The letters are already in a jumbled mess, but reorganizing them into a recognizable pattern or shape will help.


Draw a shape and write the letters around it. This makes it easier for your eye to pick up combinations since there’s no order to the letters- they’re each equally important.
The most commonly used shape is a circle. You can spin your paper or notebook any which way to get a new perspective.
Constantly rearranging your letters is important because it gives your mind new ways to look at groupings of the same letter. Sometimes you need a fresh viewpoint if you’ve been staring at the same thing for ages.;
, After you break up the anagram, start putting together pairs of letters. For example, you may notice that you have an “H” and that it normally follows a consonant like “P” or “S” to make words that contain “PH” or “SH.”In addition, “H” usually is found after “P,” “S,” “T,” “W,” and “G” unless it’s at the beginning of a word.
Unusual letter pairings like “QU” or common ones like “TH” are easy to build words from.
Once you start isolating smaller pairings, you have fewer letters to unscramble.

, Write out all of the consonants from your anagram in one column and the vowels in a separate one. Start with the consonants and write out each different way that they can be ordered. Then, insert the vowels into each combination to see how many new words you can make.If you have a lot of vowels, first find the consonant pairs since there are fewer variations to be had.
Also, if you have mostly consonants, pair the vowels that can go together. For example, “IE,” “EA,” ot “OU.”
Triple vowel combos like “beautiful” or “silhouette” are rare but taking the time to memorize them will help you solve anagrams faster. , Many words in the English language are built off of prefixes and suffixes, which are pairings of letters at the beginning or end of a word to indicate grammar. For anagrams, they can be helpful to find because all you need to do is find the pairings and build a word from the remaining letters.Some common prefixes include: un-, dis-, sub-, re-, de-, in-, ab-, ad-, and ex-.
Suffixes you may find could be: -ing, -ness, -ly, -ed, -er, -ry, -ous, -ment, and -tion.
Switch around pre- and suffixes to create more word options. For example, “paint-er” can become “re-paint” by using the same letters in a new way.

Become familiar with the notation used here.,
Know that a tick mark represents a counterclockwise movement.,
Know that a 2 represents a 180-degree movement.,
Know that a number before an algorithm in parentheses means repeat the algorithm that many times.,
Make the cross.,
Insert the corners.,
Solve the corners.,
Solve the edges.,
Celebrate!",How to Solve a 3x3x2 Rubik's Cube," Each letter refers to a 90-degree clockwise movement of a face. Holding the cube directly in front of you, these rules apply:


If the letter is F, turn the layer facing you clockwise.
If the letter is B, turn the layer opposite the layer facing you clockwise.
If the letter is U, turn the layer furthest from the floor and parallel to the floor clockwise.
If the letter is D, turn the layer closest to the floor and parallel to the floor clockwise.
If the letter is L, turn the layer on your left clockwise.
If the letter is R, turn the layer on your right clockwise.;
, For example, F' (read F prime) represents a 90-degree counterclockwise movement of the layer facing you.

, For example, U2 represents a 180-degree movement of the layer furthest from the floor.

, E.g., 2(R2 U2 F2) is executed the same as R2 U2 F2 R2 U2 F2.

, For people who know how to do this on a 3x3x3, skip this step (although keep in mind that you cannot do any 90 degree turns except on the U and D layers). For everyone else, put the layer containing a white sticker at the bottom. Follow these steps:



1. Find an edge piece (i.e. pieces neither on the corner nor in the center) on the bottom that contains white.

2. Adjust the top layer so that, directly above the edge piece containing white is a yellow piece

3. Make sure both pieces face toward you and the white center is still facing towards the ground.

4. Perform this move: F2


5. Repeat 1-4 until all white pieces are on the top

6. Insert each piece of your color scheme. Find where each color should go based on the colors around it, then adjust the U layer until both the spot where the color should be and the white piece with that color are facing you, then perform an F2.

, This is relatively simple. One algorithm is used to swap a bottom corner and the corner above it, both on the front-right side: R2 U R2 U' R2.


Keeping the white layer on the bottom, simply find where the white corner on the U layer should go, insert the corner and where it should go into the front-right side, and perform the algorithm.
If no white corners are on the top but some corners on the bottom layer are still incorrect, simply use this algorithm on a white corner that is incorrect to remove it, and then you can insert it into the place it should go, removing another that you put back in its place, etc.

, Keeping the yellow layer on the top, try to find headlights (i.e. same color, same side corners), as denoted in the image. When you found the headlights, make sure they are placed in the L layer, then perform this algorithm: (R2 U) (R2 U') (R2 U' D) (R2 U') (R2 U) (R2 D').


If there are no headlights to be found, simply perform this algorithm and headlights will appear.

, At this point, use these two algorithms until you have solved the cube.


1. Switching the UF (front-facing upper) and UB (back-facing upper) edge, i.e. Opposite: 3(R2 U2). Use this first; if any edge is the opposite of where it should be, use this. When there aren't any edges belonging in their opposite locations left ...
2. Switching the UF and UR (right-facing upper) edge, i.e. Adjacent: 2(R2 U) 2(R2 U2) (R2 U) (R2 U') R2. Finding these should be relatively simple. Find any two adjacent sides which are perfect except for inverted top edges, and perform this algorithm. If the previous algorithm was used as described beforehand, this should only need to be done at most twice.

, Now you can practice it to get good, show off to friends, solve it while you're waiting in line ... the possibilities are endless!

Separate all of the letters.,
Put the letters in alphabetic order.,
Use the alphabetized anagram to solve the puzzle.",How to Solve Anagrams Effectively2," Take out a new sheet of paper and rewrite the anagram at the top of the paper. You always want to keep the original anagram handy so that you have a reference and can check that you’re using the correct letters.

, Start with the first letter you have that’s closest to “A” and write all of the remaining letters after it in the order that they appear in the alphabet. This will help you see what kinds of letters you have or isolate an abundance of vowels or any rare letters like “Q”s or “Z”s.


Some letters may repeat but you should still write down any duplicates. Remember, you need to use every letter that exists in the original anagram.

, Just by rearranging an anagram into a jumbled yet ordered list, you can begin to see prefixes, suffixes, or even small, simple words. Once the letters are in an organized set, you can then also begin to memorize the combinations since alphabetizing is a consistent method of organizing any grouping of letters.

"
"
Organize the letters based on a pattern.,
Solve as many anagrams as possible based on the base set.,
Revisit the same anagrams often.",How to Solve Anagrams Effectively3," Take an anagram and reorganize it. Use a standard such as alphabetizing to create a 'base set' of letters from the anagram. Alphabetizing an anagram makes a base set of letters because regardless of how the letters are scrambled, they can always be put back in the same order based on that “A-Z” standard.

, You can have anagrams that appear to be different, but if you alphabetize “drife” and “ifred,” you get “defir” as a base set for both. From the base set of letters “defir,” you can create “fried” and “fired.” Memorize the alphabetized base sets and the different words you can make from it.If you play word games like Scrabble or Words With Friends, then you might see familiar combinations of letters over time.
Memorizing anagram combinations will train you to see patterns in random letter combinations. It will help you solve crossword puzzles or word games faster.

, You want to be able to recognize basic combinations of letters anywhere. Make flashcards or reread your notebook full of anagrams to commit to memory the ones you've solved. Practice often to get into the habit of unscrambling anagrams so that you become more efficient at solving them in the future.

Learn from an example.",How to Play Mastermind," Mastermind board games have a row of holes set apart at one end of the board, hidden from view under a hinged shield. The person who plays the code maker secretly takes a few colored pegs and places them in that row of holes, in any order. This is the code that the code breaker will try to guess.


If you're playing a video game version, the computer will usually do this instead of a player.
The code maker must put a peg in every hole. He has the option to use more than one peg of the same color. For example, he could put down Green Yellow Yellow Blue.;
, The other player, or the only player in video game versions, tries to guess what the hidden code is. Sitting on the opposite end of the board, she picks up the large colored pegs and places them in the nearest row of large holes.


For example, she could put down Blue Orange Green Purple. (Your Mastermind game might have more holes or different colored pegs.)

, Next to each ""guess row"" is a small square with enough holes for four tiny pegs. These pegs only come in two colors: white and red (or white and black in some versions). The code maker uses this to give clues about how good the guess was. The code maker must be honest, and always puts down pegs using these instructions:


Each white peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, but is in the wrong hole.
Each red (or black) peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, and is in the right hole.
The order of the white and black pegs does not matter.

, In our example above, the code maker secretly chose Yellow Yellow Green Blue. The code breaker guessed Blue Orange Green Purple. The code maker looks at this guess to find out which hint pegs to place:


Peg #1 is Blue. There is a blue in the code, but it is not in position #1. This earns a white hint peg.
Peg #2 is Orange. There is no orange in the code, so no hint peg gets put down.
Peg #3 is Green. There is a green in the code, and it is in position #3. This earns a red (or black) hint peg.
Peg #4 is Purple. There is no purple in the code, so no hint peg gets put down.

, The code breaker now has a little information. In our example, she got one white hint, one red hint, and two empty holes. That means of the four pegs she put down, one of them belongs but needs to be moved to a different hole, one of them is already in the right place, and two of them don't belong in the code. She thinks for a while and makes a second guess in the next highest row:


The code breaker guesses Blue Yellow Orange Pink this time.
The code maker checks this guess: Blue belongs but is in the wrong place; Yellow belongs and is in the right place; Orange doesn't belong; Pink doesn't belong.
The code maker puts down one white hint peg and one red hint peg.

, The code breaker continues to make guesses, using information from all the previous hints she earned. If she manages to guess the complete code in exactly the right order, she wins the game. If she fails to guess and fills every row with pegs, the code maker wins instead.

, If you're playing a two-person game, turn the board around so a different person invents the code, and the other person guesses. This way, everyone gets a chance to play the main part of the game: guessing the code.

, A new Mastermind player quickly learns that even a guess that earns multiple hints doesn't always lead to a quick victory, since there are so many possible ways to interpret the hints. Starting with four of a kind (such as Blue Blue Blue Blue) gives you solid information to work with right off the bat.This isn't the only strategy to use in Mastermind, but it's an easy one to pick up. It will not work very well if your version has more than six colors to choose from.

, Your next few moves are going to be two pairs of colors, always starting with two examples of the color you guessed previously. For example, following Blue Blue Blue Blue, make guesses that start with Blue Blue and finish with one other color, until you know all the colors available. Here's an example:



Blue Blue Blue Blue — no hint pegs. That's fine, we'll keep using Blue anyway.

Blue Blue Green Green – one white peg. We'll keep in mind that the code has one green, and it must be in the left half.

Blue Blue Pink Pink — one black peg. We now know that one pink is in the code, in the right.

Blue Blue Yellow Yellow – one white peg and one black peg. There must be at least two yellows in the code, one on the left and one on the right.

, Once you have earned four hint pegs in total, you know exactly which colors are involved, but not in what order. In our example, the code must contain green, pink, yellow, and yellow. The system of dividing the board into two pairs has also given us some information on which order to put them in, so we should be able to get this in one to three guesses:


We know that Green Yellow Pink Yellow have a left half and right half that contain the correct pegs, but it turns out we get two white pegs and two black pegs in our results. This means one of the halves (either #1 and #2 need to switch places, or else #3 and #4 do).
We try Yellow Green Pink Yellow and get four black pegs — the code is solved.

, For example red and blue:


Red Red Blue Blue

Result 1: no pegs: red and blue are not in the code

Result 2: one white or black peg (lets suppose a white peg). Either red or blue is in the code once. Blue Blue Blue Blue will give you a peg if it's blue, or no pegs if it's red (let's suppose no pegs). In the example we now know there's a red pin, and that it's in the 3rd or 4th spot (as we got a white pin at Red Red Blue Blue). Finding it will be discussed in the next strategy (in one step: Red Green Green Green ).

Result 3: more pegs (lets suppose 2 white pegs). Just as Result 2, we can try Blue Blue Blue Blue to know how many pins were blue (lets again assume zero). Now it's only a matter finding the pins. In the example, we already know the 3rd and 4th are red pins, as there are 2 red pin , and they are not in the first or second spot (as we gotten 2 white pegs)

, You can find a pin by trying each of the locations. As alternate color, we use colors we haven't tested yet. This way, we not only find the red pin, but also additional information about other colors. The following is an example, if you know there's a red pin, but don't know in which one of the four holes it is. It will also give you the amount of green, yellow and pink.


Red Green Green Green
Yellow Red Yellow Yellow
Pink Pink Red Pink

Note: If you know the exact amount of reds, you don't need to try the last location: if there's one red pin, and it's not in the first, second or third location, it has to be in the fourth).

Result 1: If there are no white pegs, you'll have at least one black peg. That peg indicates the red pin is on the correct location

Result 2: If there's one white peg, you know the red pin is on an incorrect place, and that the alternate color isn't in the code

Result 3: If there's a second white peg, you know the second color should be on the location where the red pin is.

Result 4: If there's one or more black pegs, that indicates that the second color is present. It also gives you the amount of pins of that color, and you know it's not on the location where red is (as that would give a white peg), or, obviously, on the location where red ends up being

, Put one color in the place you know, and the other color in the places you don't know. For example green and yellow, and we know the first pin is red:


Green Yellow Yellow Yellow

Result 1: no pegs; green and yellow are not in the code

Result 2a: a white peg indicates green is in the code, but we don't know the amount (it might be one, but also two or even three)

Result 2b: the amount of black pegs indicates the amount of yellow in the code (as noted in Strategy 2: knowing the exact amount can save you a step in finding the color)

, This strategy looks a lot like the previous strategy, but now the amount of white pegs also gives us the amount of that color, the For example green and yellow, and we know the first two pins are red:


Green Green Yellow Yellow

Result 1: no pegs: green and yellow are not in the code

Result 2a: a white peg indicates one green is in the code, while 2 pegs indicate there are green are in the code (since there are only 2 unknowns, it's impossibly for there to be three greens)

Result 2b: as with the previous strategy, the amount of black pegs indicates the amount of yellow in the code. (as noted in Strategy 2: knowing the exact amount can save you a step in finding the color)

, In this example, as always, we start with strategy 1 ...


(strategy 1) Blue Blue Red Red gives 2 white pegs. So we know there's red and/or blue present. We want to know which is blue and which is red, so we check:
(strategy 1 bis) Blue Blue Blue Blue gives one black peg. This means, we know in the previous answer, there was one blue (and on the wrong spot - so will be 3rd or 4th), and thus also one red (and also on the wrong spot, so will be 1st or 2nd)
(strategy 2 (find blue)) Green Green Blue Green gives a white and a black pegs. We tested one of the locations of blue, and as there's a white peg, we know it's not the 3rd peg. As we know it was either the 3rd or 4th peg, we know the 4th peg is blue. The black peg also indicates there's a green peg, but it's not the 3rd spot (as it's a black peg, not a white peg).
(strategy 2 (find red)) Red Yellow Yellow Yellow gives a single white peg, so while we know, red is in the first or second spot, we now know it's not in the first spot. So it's in the second location. We also know there's no yellow color
The next color we had information over was green - but as we know it's not the third spot, and the second and forth spot are filled with blue & red, we know it's on the first spot.
(strategy 4) Orange Orange Pink Orange Gives a white peg. So, we know the only unknown spot - the 3rd spot - has an orange color
(answer) Green Red Orange Blue

Keep one person from blurting out the answer if playing in a group.",How to Play Petals Around the Rose," Five is the optimal number of dice to begin with. You can play the game at a more advanced level with more dice.;
, The aim of the game is to determine how many petals around the rose there are each time multiple dice are rolled.


Get someone to facilitate the game for you. They will roll the dice and tell you the number of petals around the rose.
The facilitator should not disclose the reasoning behind this number. That's for you to work out!Eventually, when you solve the puzzle, you will be able guess the number of petals on a particular roll of the dice on your own.
Play an online version if you don't have a friend to facilitate - http://weavervsworld.com/docs/think/rose/


, Your friend (who already knows the solution) will reveal how many petals around the rose there are for this roll.


At first, it will be unclear how they got this number. Get them to roll the dice several times and tell you how many petals there are each time.
Can you see a pattern emerging that determines the number of petals around the rose each turn?
Take your time. It may take several rolls to figure out the solution.

, Solving this puzzle requires you to exercise your problem-solving skills. Think 'outside the box' or laterally to assess the information you have in front of you.This will help you see the hidden rules of the game determining the number of petals around the rose.


For example, the game is called ""Petals Around the Rose"" and this name is significant.Why might it be called petals around the rose?
How might this name relate to the faces of the dice you are seeing?

, Dice showing 3 or 5 have dots in the center of their face. These dice represent the roses. The petals are the dots surrounding this center dot.


For example, a die with a 5 on it has 4 petals around the rose.
A die with a 3 on it has 2 petals around the rose.
A die with 1 only has one dot on its face. It is a rose without petals.

, Dice showing 2, 4 or 6 do not have a dot in the middle of their face. They are not roses and you can disregard them. They don't count when you are adding up the total number of petals around the rose for a particular roll.

, If there are no petals or roses, the answer is zero.


For example, if you get a roll with 5, 4, 6, 1, there are 4 petals around the rose. 4 and 6 are even numbers so the dice showing these numbers do not count as roses. The die with 1 represents a rose without a petal. The die showing a 5 has 4 petals around the rose. Therefore, the total number of petals around the rose is 4.
If you get 2, 4, 6, 1, then the total number of petals will be zero. There are no dice with dots in the center and therefore no roses.

, Challenge a friend to play the game and solve the puzzle for themselves.

, Ask your friend, ""How many petals around the rose are there?"" Be prepared to roll the dice as many times as necessary.


Remember that different people will take different lengths of time to work out the solution.
Some even say that the smarter you are the longer it takes you to work it out!Tell your friend this if they are struggling to work out the solution. It will inspire them to keep going.

, Let them know the number of petals but don't reveal the logic behind it.


Offer some helpful hints. Remind them that the name of the game is significant. Also, the answer will be either an even number or zero., If your friend thinks they have worked out the solution, test them by rolling the dice and asking them how many petals around the rose there are. If they guess correctly over several rolls, they have worked out the solution., This will keep the game fun for all members of the group and allow everyone to work it out in their own time.


Tell the first person to solve the puzzle that they are a Potentate of the Rose and they must guard the secret."

Get some people.,
Explain to them the game.,
Provide about three different numbers of elephants.,
Ask how many elephants there are.,
Continue playing until most people know the answer.,
Give hints to beggars.,
Tell them how to do it.",How to Play the Elephant Game," You should generally have 1 to five people, but the bigger the better. Just make sure no one will spoil it once they have solved the riddle.;
, Explain to them that you'll be giving them multiple numbers of elephants, and they need to try to figure out how many elephants there are. Don't tell them how to calculate the number of elephants, though.

, It's best to use the scene around you and incorporate people. Here's a good example:


There's fourteen elephants in Jimmy's hat, eighty three in Darla's pocket, and two in Terry's nose.


, This isn't as simple as it seems. The amount of words in your final question symbolise the amount of elephants. For instance, asking ""how many elephants are there?"" means there are five elephants, regardless of the numbers provided beforehand. ""How many?"" means two elephants, and so on. So once you ask this question, you'll probably get a variety of answers from everyone. Once they're done, say the real answer.

, For some people, the answer shouldn't take very long. For others, they'll think you're doing really complex math and will attempt long equations having to do with the first numbers you provided. After a while, these people will give up and will walk away wondering. Eventually, they'll find out.

, Some people may be so frustrated about the simple riddle that they'll be dying for hints. The biggest hint you can give away is something like ""Bop, beep, beep, beep bop. How many?"" Don't even provide numbers anymore, and only have a question. Then they'll probably get it.

, Only do this if they are really mad and frustrated. It isn't worth spoiling a good puzzle over someone who's just curious. If they are really aggravated by it, tell them how. It's not worth losing a friend over.

Play to win.",How to Play Jenga," First, shake the Jenga blocks out onto a flat surface. Then, stack the blocks in sets of three until you have built a tower that is 18 blocks high. Each new layer of three parallel blocks should be rotated 90° along the horizontal axis from the last layer.








Your Jenga set should include 54 blocks. However, if you are missing blocks, you can still play the game! Just build the tower as usual.;
, Before you play, make sure that the structure is sturdy. The block layers should interlock so that the tower stands tall without any external support. Use your hands or a flat, solid object to smooth out the sides. Push in any pieces that jut out.








, Make sure that you have at least two players. Have everyone sit in a circle around the block structure. If you are only playing with one other person, then sit facing each other from opposite sides of the tower.








There is no strict maximum amount of players. However, it might be more fun with fewer people so that you get more turns.

, This is an optional variation of Jenga. Before you stack the tower, write something on each block: a question, or a ""dare,"" or some other directive. Then, shuffle the blocks and stack the Jenga tower as usual. When each person pulls a block from the tower, he or she must do the thing that is written on the block.









Questions: When someone pulls a question from the tower, he or she must answer that question. Questions might be flirtatious (""Who do you most want to kiss in this room?), thoughtful (""When was a time that you felt small?""), or humorous (""What is your most embarrassing moment?"")
Dares: When someone pulls a dare from the tower, he or she must perform the action on the block. Dares might be anything from ""Trade one item of clothing with the person beside you,"" to ""Drink a shot of hot sauce,"" to ""Make a scary face.""

, This can be the person who built the tower, or the person with the next birthday, or the person who most wants to start.








, Carefully take one block out from any level of the tower except the top. Look for the block that is the loosest, or the easiest to remove, or that will least disturb the stability of the tower. You can push the block or pull the block, depending on the angle and the location in the stack.









Remember: you can only touch the tower with one hand a time. This rule keeps players from holding the tower steady while they pull their blocks., The player that pulled the block puts it back on top of the tower to continue the pattern of layering-by-threes. Try to stack them neatly so that the tower stays strong. As the game goes on, the tower will grow higher and higher until it teeters, unstable, and falls.








, The ""loser"" of the game is the person who makes the tower topple. Rebuild the tower to play again!







, Do not rush Jenga! Carefully and intentionally take your time to pull the right block when your turn comes around. If you try to go too quickly, you will be more likely to topple the tower.








, Gently poke your way around the tower to find the pieces that are safest to remove. Look for the loose blocks and the blocks that are already sticking out of the tower. Be careful as you go, and always keep an eye on the overall stability of the structure. Make sure to maintain the balance.








Each layer of the tower has three parallel blocks: two on the outside, and one in the center. If you go for a block in the middle, you will generally be less likely to set the tower off-kilter.
Take blocks from the top or the middle of the stack. The blocks at the bottom of the tower can be hard to remove without dangerously destabilizing the structure. The blocks near the very top can be so loose that they pull other blocks apart with them.

, If you're taking a block from the middle, try gently poking it through the tower from one side. If you are taking a block from the outside edge, try pinching the ends between your thumb and forefinger, then wiggling the piece back and forth until it comes loose. Use a combination of tapping and wiggling to take out difficult blocks.








, Notice which way the tower is tilting after you have removed your block from the stack. Then, carefully arrange your block on top so that the extra top-heavy weight won't send the tower toppling down.








Alternately: if you think you can get away with it, try placing your block on the weaker ""leaning"" side so that it is that much harder for the next player to pull a block.

, If you care about the competitive aspect of the game, then you don't want the tower to fall on your turn. Try planning out your moves to destabilize the structure so that it will topple on someone else. Remove important pieces from near the bottom of the stack, and generally try to pick the best piece that you can.









Try to be a good sport. Respect other players, and do not go out of your way to mess them up while they're taking their turns. If you make the game less fun for everyone else, then they may not want to play with you again!

Start asking questions.,
Stop when 20 questions have been asked.","How to Play the ""Mind Reading"" Game1"," The objective is the person, place or thing that the other players are trying to figure out. For example, the “person” can be living, dead or even a character from fiction. The “place” can be anywhere on the globe. The “thing” can be any inanimate object.


The other players are the ""questioners.""Once decided, the answerer should not tell anyone what the objective is.
Keep the number of players between 2 and 5 for best results.;
, Once an objective has been chosen, the game can begin. The players take turns questioning the answerer. These questions must have simple “yes” or “no” answers. The answerer will keep track of the number of questions asked. The limit for each round is 20 questions.Sample questions: ""Is it a mammal?"" or ""Is it bigger than a basketball?"" or “Can you walk on it?”
Any question that helps the players determine the objective can be asked.

, If one of the questioners figures out the answer before 20 questions are used up, that person wins the round and gets to be the answerer in the next round. If no one has figured out the correct answer after 20 questions are asked, the answerer wins the round and gets to be “it” again for the next round.Each round takes approximately 5 minutes.
If no one guesses the right answer after 20 questions are asked, the answerer should reveal the answer to the players before moving on to the next round.

, If all the items previous to the next player's term have to be named, this becomes a lot harder than simply remembering the next letter in the alphabet. As such, the memory alphabet game should be reserved for older players with good memories, while the easier version can be used for children who know their alphabet and every age up. By way of explanation:


If you had an alphabet game requiring the person to remember the next word only, they could hear ""Apple"" and then say ""Banana"".
For the game in which the player must repeat what has already been said plus their own addition, they would say: ""Apple"", ""Banana"", ""Cherry"", etc. This clearly gets much harder as there are 26 letters to remember! (A good one for long car trips.)

, The alphabet game works best with a theme, so that everyone's attention is focused on words that come from a particular idea. Some great themes include:



Shopping: ""I went to the shop for an Apron""; 'I went to the shop for a Bowtie""; ""I went to the shop for a Camisole""; ""I went to the shop for a Denim jacket""; etc.
Animals: ""I want to have an Ape for a pet""; ""I want to have a Bee for a pet""; ""I want to have a Cow for a pet""; I want to have a Deer for a pet""; etc.
Food: ""I had Apples for dinner""; ""I had Beets for dinner""; I had Chips for dinner; I had Dates for dinner""; etc.

, For example, Q, X, and Z are often tricky and you might need to either exclude them or make up exceptions for using them.

, There are many ways to award prizes for the alphabet game. Some of the ways include:


A prize for the person who can go the longest remembering all the different things said for each letter of the alphabet (if playing the memory version)
A prize for the most interesting or clever items named for the letters of the alphabet

Have them add that number to the age they’ll be at the end of the year. They can write it down on a piece of paper if that helps them do the math more easily. Make sure that they don’t let you see it.


Example 1: Born in 1981. So 81 + 35 (age) = 116.
Example 2: Born in 1999. So 99 + 17 (age) = 116.

, The only exceptions are for people born in or after the year 2000. If you know or suspect that the person was born in or after the year 2000, the answer will always be “16” rather than “116.”


Example: The birth year is 2003, so the last 2 digits of the year are 03.
If the person adds the age they’ll be at the end of the year to that number, it will always be 16. In this case, a person born in 2003 is 13 years old.
03 + 13 = 16.
Note that the invariable answer depends on the current year. In the year 2017, the answer will always be 117 (17 if born in or after 2000). In 2018 the answer will always be 118 (or 18), and so on."

Select someone who falls somewhere in between those extremes. This person is engaged and paying attention, but not jumping up and down with excitement.


The people who are overly eager to participate are usually just seeking attention for themselves. You don’t want to perform with someone who is trying to upstage you.
The very shy people don’t want to be involved and are generally not very enjoyable to perform with.

, Body language is nonverbal communication transmitted through movement. Certain movements can give you helpful clues about a person’s current mental state. This is very helpful when you're performing. For example, if someone is fidgeting with their hands, shaking their leg or tapping their toes, this usually indicates anxiety, irritation or boredom.Being able to read body language is a useful skill to have when you're playing other kinds of games, too. For example, card games.
Good posture and standing up straight communicates confidence and alertness; slouching indicates shyness, sadness or a lack of confidence.
Pay attention to your own body language as well. Stand up straight and look the person directly in the eye. Avoid fidgeting.

, When the muscles around the mouth are pulled back, the eyebrows are lifted and/or the forehead is wrinkled, this usually means the person is afraid, nervous or lying about something. When you’re performing, remember these tips for yourself, as well.Control your facial muscles as much as you can so that you won’t give anything away.
This skill is also very useful for card games.
Avoid making any extra facial movements, such as eye rolling, that can communicate negativity and judgement.

, A lot of people are easily responsive to emotional situations and hardships. For sympathetic and empathetic people, you will want to play to their emotions by having them feel bad for you. This will lead them into helping you however you say you need it., This tactic requires you to gain the sympathy of the other person.

""I knew you would let me down.""
""I am not surprised that you won't do it, I am used to it."", If you find someone who goes by fact, and does not believe in something unless there is evidence to back it up, then you need more than emotions to mess with this person.

Divide your players into teams of two people, preferably with a man and a woman on each team.If you’re playing the game with couples, each couple can be their own team.
If you don’t have an equal number of players, ask one person to serve as the referee and official spinner. If you do have an even number of players, the referee position will rotate amongst the players.
If you prefer not to play with teams, each player can play on their own individual team.;
, Spread your mat across the floor; if you’re playing the game outside, make sure to anchor the mat at each corner so it doesn’t blow away. Players should start at opposite ends of the mat, with each person standing near the word Twister. Each player should begin with one foot on the yellow circle and one foot on the blue circle closest to their side.If you’re playing with three people, set up the players as you would for a two player game, then have the third player face the red-circle side of the mat, with one foot on each of the two middle red circles.
If you’re playing with teams, a member of each team will play in each round and eventually the winners of each round will face off in a final match.

, Every time the referee spins the spinner, they will call out the body part and color the spinner points to. Each player must place that body part on the corresponding circle. A circle must be vacant for a player to be able to use it.If a player currently has a body part on a color and that color is called again, the player must move to a new circle of that same color.
If two players reach for the same circle at the same time, it is up to the referee to decide who got there first.
If all six circles of the same color are already covered, the referee must spin again until a new color can be called out.

, Any player who falls or touches the mat with an elbow or knee will be immediately ejected from the game. Players may choose to eliminate themselves if they feel they cannot hold a position any longer.The player left standing at the end of the game, wins.
If you are playing with teams, don’t forget to have the winners of each heat face off at the end.

Don't respond immediately to texts and phone calls.,
Be flirtatious around other people.,
Disappear for a few days.,
Say you're fine when you're not.",How to Play Mind Games3," People who are always available leave little room for mystery or deception. Instead of waiting by the phone to engage in conversation, let her think you are busy.


If she is excited to text you in the morning with a flirty greeting, do not send one back until hours later. This will leave her wondering where you are and who you might be with.
The same goes for a phone call. If she calls you, do not answer it. Call her back hours later, or maybe even the next day. Your unavailability will leave her guessing.

, When it is just the two of you hanging out, let the sparks fly. Show her that that you two have great chemistry, and something special may come out of this relationship. Then, we you two come around other people, show some flirtatious attention to other girls. This will surely mess with her mind.Engage in fun conversations with other girls by telling jokes and making them laugh.

, Maybe you two have been spending a lot of great time together, and things seem to be heating up. Throw her off course by not speaking to her for a few days.


If she calls or texts you, asking you to meet up or just chat, simply send her a text that explains you are busy. Be vague, and tell her that you will call her in a few days when you get a chance.

, If your significant other somehow lets you down, or disappoints you, tell her that everything is fine and you understand, but then act upset. This will surely play games with their mindIf your significant other cancels plans with you, say, ""Don't worry about it, I totally understand. We can reschedule for another time."" Then, when you two speak or hangout next, act very reserved, limit your laughter and smiles, and seem on the sad side. When she asks you if something is wrong, say, ""No, everything is fine.""

Test their dignity.,
Show you care.,
Instill fear and then provide relief.,
Figure out someone's desire.",How to Play Mind Games4," Most people do not like to claim defeat, or admit when something becomes too hard for them to do. By presenting undesirable tasks in certain ways, you can easily convince someone to agree to what you want.


If you want someone to shovel snow from your driveway, you may ask, ""Can you keep shoveling the driveway or do you need me to do it? If you can't handle it, then it is okay, I can.""
By offering to take over the thing you want that person to continue doing, you provide that person with the idea that you are kind and willing to help. When you add in the statement about not being able to handle the situation, that person will continue to shovel to avoid admitting defeat.

, If you show someone that you care about their well-being, or you want to have him or her as a friend, it will naturally invite that person into your life.


Do someone a favor. When you go out of your way for another person, that person will feel indebted to you and will want to return the favor.Find a way to help someone out, and then after you have completed the task, ask for a favor. It will be hard for that person to turn you down.

, A great way to influence the way someone makes a decision, is to make that person fear a situation enough to be willing to do whatever you say to avoid it from happening.If you want someone to start exercising with you, give statistics about how not working out can lead to terrible health problems. Then, explain how you can teach that person great exercises to avoid getting those health problems.

, If you're dealing with people who are driven by desire, simply explain an easy way to obtain what they want. Tell them how to easily make more money, get a job promotion, or buy a better car. Making them believe they can have brighter futures by doing what you say is an easy way to play mind games."

Choose your alcoholic drinks.,
Choose your non-alcoholic drinks.,
Pour the drinks into shot glasses.,
Place the shot glasses in a circle or rows.",How to Play Shot Roulette1," Get any type of alcoholic drink you like. Stick with just one type of liquor for traditional shots, or mix it up with all different kinds of alcohol, including:


Red or white wine
Beer
Hard cider
Vodka, rum, whiskey, gin, or tequila;
, Pick out any non-alcoholic beverages you like. You may want to choose liquids of the same color as your alcohol to make it more confusing which is which. Try:


Water or clear soda to look like vodka, gin, rum, or tequila
Grape juice to look like wine or brandy
Cola or root beer to look like whiskey or dark rum
Ginger ale or cream soda to look like beer
Juice or sports drinks to look like colored liquor

, Get enough glass or disposable plastic shot glasses to complete a big circle or several rows. Pour your alcoholic drink or drinks into half the number of your shot glasses and your non-alcoholic drinks into the other half.


You don’t need a specific number, but two shot glasses per player is recommended.Use different colored and opaque shot glasses to partially disguise the color or type of liquid inside.

, Set your filled shot glasses on an even surface like a large table or hard floor. Pick a surface that you can easily clean, as shots may get knocked and spilled.


If you’re playing the version using a bottle to spin, place the shot glasses in a large circle and put an empty wine, liquor, or beer bottle in the center of the circle. Make sure the bottle is completely empty for the best spin.
If you’re playing the version using cards and dice, place the shot glasses in rows.

Continue down the line until one team has finished drinking and flipping.,
Tap lightly.,
Practice.,
Try to keep the table dry.,
Be patient.",How to Play Flip Cup," Line up plastic Solo cups along each side of a rectangular table so that each side has the same number of cups. There are two teams in flip cup: one on each side of the table. Players take turn drinking the beer in their cup, then flipping the empty cup on the edge of the table until it lands perfectly upside down on the tabletop.Play flip cup with three or more people on each team – 6+ total. The more flippers on each team, the longer the game will be.;
, Pour each players drink of choice into his or her cup. If no one objects, simply fill each up 1/4 to halfway up with beer. You can adjust the volume of beer to match the amount that each person wants to drink. Keep in mind, however, that the game will be most fair if everyone has to drink the same amount.If you're going to play multiple rounds of flip cup, consider playing with beer or another relatively low-alcohol beverage. Flip cup is a fast-paced game, and it can be dangerous to play with liquor.
If you don't drink alcohol, fill your cups with another beverage of choice. For an easier game, fill the cups with something that you like drinking. For a more difficult game, fill the cups with something that's harder to drink, such as hot sauce.

, Find your partner and ""match up."" When each person's cup is equally filled, he or she looks across the table to find someone to ""match with."" The teams should be equal, and each person should be standing directly across from someone on the other team.


Make sure that everyone knows which direction the flipping will go. This game is a relay race, and each round of flip cup always begins at one end of the table and ends at the other end. Each player should know which two players are starting the round, and which two players are the ""anchors"" at the end.

, Everyone at the table raises their cup to ""touch cups"" with the opposing player across from them. Make sure that everyone at the table has a partner and is ready to start the round. Hold cups in the air until everyone is matched up. Then, place all cups on the table, and don't touch them again until it's your turn.

, to begin. The first player from each team drinks the beer as fast a they can from his or her cup. As the first player: when you finish your beer, set the empty cup on the table, open side up, so that it hangs slightly off the edge of the table. The next player on your team cannot start drinking until you flip your cup in the air such that it lands top-side down on the table.

, Use your finger to tap the bottom of the cup, flipping it in the air. Try to tap lightly enough that the cup makes only a 180° rotation. You want the cup to land squarely on the table, open side down. If the cup doesn't land right: reset it on the edge of the table, and continue to flip until you get it right. Once you've successfully flipped your cup, tell the next player in line to start drinking!


The flipping motion is an act of finesse. You may need to practice your flip many times over in order to get it right.
No steadying the cup. Only one hand can touch the cup at one time!Remember: the other team isn't waiting for you to flip the cup. This is a relay race. If it takes you more than a few tries to execute the flip, then the race may be lost – unless the other team is also taking a while!

, The first team to finish wins. All of the cups should sit squarely upside down on the tabletop. If you wish to play another round: set the table up exactly as you did the first time, refill the cups, and play again!


The second-place team does not need to finish all of their beers, unless both teams agree that this is the rule. If you're playing multiple rounds, consider saving the beer for the next round!

, The fewer rotations the cup makes in the air, the easier it will be to get it to land squarely on the table. Try to make the motion so gently that the cup almost just ""tips"" over 180°. The more rotations the cup takes, the more wildly it is liable to land.


Adjust your flipping motion. If you notice that you're tapping too hard, tap a little lighter. If you notice that you're tapping too lightly, then go a bit harder.

, Before the game begins, try flipping an empty cup on the edge of the table to calibrate your tapping motion. If there's a big flip cup competition coming up, practice flipping cups on your own when you have a free moment. Beyond the drinking game itself, this practice can be a good way to train your hand-eye coordination.

, If there is water or spilled beer on the table, it might confound the flipping and landing of the cups. Use a towel to wipe up any spilled beverage before each round.

, It is easy to get flustered if you don't flip the cup on the first try. Take a deep breath, slow down, and find your center amid the frenzy. You will flip better if you're careful and intentional about it.

Gather your friends.,

Get ready for the fun part.,
Throw the soap clouds at each other.,
Know the bonuses.,
Play the required amount of levels.,
End the game.,
Happy playing.",How to Play Soap Cloud Fight," Every team should have at least two people, one will be you and the other will be your assistant. Another one-the referee will stand in the between. Totally, five people will be there.;
, Have two bars of soap, two loofahs, two water sprays, a tub of water and two mugs. For protective clothing, try out swimsuits and goggles. Don't be naked!

, Don't do this indoors unless it's in the bathroom. It's best and safest played outdoors.

, Grab some soap and your loofah. Form soap clouds by rubbing the loofah with the soap, then squeezing the loofah. This causes it to form soap clouds.

, The one who hits a person with the soap cloud wins a point.

, Sprays and tubs of water can be used to break soap clouds, but only so many times. Basically, you can use any of them thrice for every level (and if used, they need to be refilled at each new level). Thus, in total, you can use all of them twelve times throughout an entire game (together, if you used the tub twice and the spray once, that counts for three times). Use these bonus items for breaking the clouds only, not for shooting the players.

, There are supposed to be three levels, two short and the final level is the longest. The first two levels should go for five minutes, while the final level should be for double that time. However, you can change the rules if wished.


The assistant must keep supplying soap clouds and the water sprays.

, When time out occurs, the referee will notify you.

, Don't stay out there for too long!

Decide on your clothing rules.,
Review the rules.,
Apply penalties.,
Modify the game to suit your needs.",How to Play Strip Twister2," All players should begin a game of Strip Twister wearing the same number of clothing articles. Five or six articles of clothing tends to work best.Hats, socks, shoes and jewelry count as clothing articles.
It is recommended that everyone apply deodorant and play in a well ventilated room for maximum enjoyment.

, In Strip Twister, any time the spinner lands on red, all players must remove an article of clothing. Only one hand or foot may be lifted from the mat at a time, even when the player is removing clothing. When removing clothing, the hand or foot must be placed back on the spot it originated from before another hand or foot can be lifted.
If a player falls while removing an article of clothing, they must remove an additional item of clothing as a penalty.

, Since this is Twister with a twist, there are certain penalties in this game that do not exist in the standard game of Twister. In regular Twister, if a player falls, they are automatically removed from the game. In Strip Twister, they just remove an article of clothing. Whoever has the most clothing on at the end, wins the game.Anyone who is caught wearing more than the allotted amount of clothing must immediately remove the extra clothing.
Anyone caught cheating in any form will be punished by having to remove an additional article of clothing.

, If you choose to play Strip Twister with a larger group, you may decide to add additional restrictions to make the game more competitive and more family friendly.


Players may choose to strip down only to their undergarments or bathing suits.
If the spinner lands on yellow, that can also be an automatic strip."
"
Start out naked.,
Make it a drinking game.,
Play Oily Twister.",How to Play Strip Twister3," Naked Twister generally works best if you’re playing solely with a significant other. Instead of gradually taking off your clothing throughout the game, start naked and up the ante by distracting each other with physical affection.Try licking, nuzzling, kissing or tickling your opponent to get them to relinquish their spot on the board.Make the game more romantic by turning down the lights and adding some candles. Just make sure not to knock the candles over in the heat of the moment.

, In Drunk Twister, the game remains the same, but each player must take a shot each time they slip on the mat, but don’t fall. The game continues until everyone has fallen, or everyone has drunk so much that they can’t go on.Use small shot glasses for drinks, otherwise the game may take a dangerous turn.
You can choose to increase the number of shots a player has to take for each slip. For example, after the first slip, they might take one shot, after the second, two and so on.

, Take Naked Twister one step further by rubbing your opponent down with baby oil before beginning the game. Play Naked Twister as you normally would, but expect to spend most of the time slipping and sliding across the board.In keeping with the theme, the loser of Oily Twister must give the winner a full-body massage.
Keep medical supplies handy – Oily Twister has a much higher injury rate than Naked Twister.

Pick a player to spin first.,
Drink what the bottle lands on.,
Replace the shot.,
Continue playing counter-clockwise.",How to Play Shot Roulette2," Choose the first player and have them spin the bottle in the middle of the circle of shots. All players can sit or stand in a circle around the shots to watch the bottle spin.


The first player can volunteer, or you can choose a fun way to pick who has the first turn, like the youngest person in the group, the winner of a rock-paper-scissors battle, or whoever got out of bed earliest that morning., Wait for the bottle to come to a stop after spinning. The player who spun must drink the shot that the mouth of the bottle is pointing toward.


Don’t let the player smell or examine the shot too closely before drinking it—they must drink it right away!
If the bottle isn’t pointing directly at one shot glass, decide on which it is closest to, or default to the shot to its right. If you continue to have this problem, try adding more shot glasses to make a fuller circle.

, Have the player who spun and drank refill the shot they took. They should refill their shot glass with whatever type of shot (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) they just took.


Players can bluff and keep the type of drink they got or refill with a secret. Agree on this before the game begins.

, Have the person to the left of the first player go next. Repeat the process of spinning, drinking, and refilling for each player.


You can play as many times around the circle of players as you like. Players can opt out any time, or you can make rules that a player is “out” if they spill a drink or get three alcoholic shots in a row, for example.

Find people to play with you.,
Choose somewhere safe to play.,
Choose a signal for when the game is over or everyone should come out of hiding.,
Choose the seeker.,
Blindfold the seeker and have her spin in a circle while counting to ten.,
Run and hide!,
Seek the other players.,
Shout for the ""first clap"".,
Choose a new seeker.",How to Play Hide and Clap," You only need two people to play this game, but it can be more fun and challenging if there are multiple people hiding.


One person will be the seeker.
All other players will hide.
Consider the ages of the other players. Unless there is an adult keeping an eye on things, you might not want a blindfolded toddler running around as the seeker. Hide and Go Seek might be better for a player under 6 years old.;
, Because the seeker is blindfolded, it's important to choose a place where they won't easily get hurt. Try not to play near a busy street, traffic, or a steep drop-off if you're playing outside. If you're playing inside, make sure you lock doors that lead to stairways.


Set the boundaries. If you don't want anyone to go in certain areas--like your parent's room, upstairs, or the basement--make sure everyone knows and agrees to stay out of these areas.
Decide if it's okay for people to hide in things, like dressers or closets.

, It's often ""Olly, Olly, Oxen Free!""but you can choose any phrase you'd like. Just make sure everyone knows the signal.

, There are countless ways to do this: rock, paper, scissors; drawing straws; eenie, meenie, miny, moe; or yelling ""not it,"" with the last person who says it becoming ""it."", You can use a scarf or bandana or any scrap of fabric as a blindfold. The spinning will disorient the seeker so she doesn't know which direction she is facing or what obstacles are in her way.


If you don't have a blindfold, the seeker can just close her eyes. Just make sure she doesn't peek!
The seeker can count anywhere from 10 to 100. If people need more time to hide, try counting to 25 or 50., Everyone else scatters to find a hiding place.Try and keep quiet as you find your spot, though the seeker will have a hard time figuring out which direction you went since she'll be spinning.


You may change your hiding place at any time, but if you're noisy you may get caught!

, Once finished counting, the seeker begins searching for the other players. If you are the seeker, use your hands to guide you so you don't bump into anything, and listen carefully. Players may be breathing heavily after running to find their hiding spot and this may lead you in their direction.

, The seeker can ask for three claps during the game (first, second, and third clap), and the people hiding must clap their hands.


Don't waste your claps! You only have three chances, so try not to use them all right away or one right after the other. Pay attention to other cues--breathing, giggling, creaking floorboards--to help you find the other players.
The players who are hiding can change hiding places. Just be aware of how much noise you are making!

, The game ends once the seeker catches someone who is hiding, and that person becomes ""it."" If the seeker uses all her claps and can't find anyone, she may give up and call the signal that the game is over, usually ""Olly, Olly, Oxen Free!""


You may want to use a timer so the game doesn't go on too long and become boring.
If the seeker doesn't find anyone, she must take another turn as the seeker.But if someone else wants a turn, it's okay to switch. It may be frustrating to the seeker if she never finds anyone!

Set up the game.,
Take turns shooting.,
Play ""chance"" during the game.,
Make up rules as you go along.,
Challenge the shooter.,
End the game.",How to Play Quarters1," You will need one standard cup (milk glass will do), some alcohol, cups to put the alcohol in, a table, and a quarter. Players (as many as you would like) sit around the table, either standing or in chairs. The milk glass is placed in the center of the table, at least 10 inches away from each player. Each person gets their own cup, filled with the alcohol of their choosing. Beer is usually used rather than hard liquor., Players take turns shooting, generally proceeding counterclockwise around the table. The objective is to bounce the quarter off of the table, into the milk glass at the center of the table. If the quarter lands in the glass, then the shooter chooses any player in the game to take a drink from his or her own beverage. The shooter's turn doesn't end until he or she misses., After a miss, the shooter passes the quarter to the next player. Sometimes, after a miss, the shooter can opt to play ""chance"", which gives them another attempt. All that is required of this is for the shooter to say the word ""chance"" after a miss. A successful ""chance"" shot means the shooter can continue shooting normally, but a miss results in a penalty drink., The great thing about quarters is that there is a great deal of replay value. If the shooter hits three in a row, he or she is allowed to make up a rule. Rules should be creative and fun, and can involve performing a ritual when drinking, or prohibiting the use of certain common words. A player who breaks any of the rules must take a penalty drink.As the game progresses and the players become inebriated, the many rules often prove difficult to remember. The objective of the game is not to be a stickler however, but to enjoy the game and have fun.
Some examples of made-up rules include, but are not limited too: banning the word ""drink,"" have a drink before each attempted shot, no use of proper names, etc.

, If the shooter were to hit the top rim of the glass and miss the shot, the other players may call for a challenge (challenging the shooter to get it in). If the shooter misses again, he or she must take a drink for each challenging player, but if the shooter gets it in the glass all challengers must drink. However, the shooter does not have to accept the initial challenge, and can instead choose to pass the coin on to the next shooter., Players are disqualified from the game when they cannot, or do not want to, consume any more of their alcoholic beverage. The last remaining player is the winner. You can then replay the game over and over again, seeing whether or not that shooter can remain unbeaten."

Fold an 8 ½” by 11” sheet of paper lengthwise and cut the fold to make two half sheets.,
Fold one of the half sheets lengthwise.,
Fold the bottom right corner upwards to form a triangle.",How to Play Paper Football," Make sure the surface used is smooth enough to not hinder the game. The field size will be dependent on where you are playing. The length and difficulty of a game will differ if you are using a school desk compared to a conference table.;
, These are important for when you attempt to “kick” a field goal. Decide whether you want to make a physical goal post using materials, or a finger goal post when the time calls for it.


To make finger goal posts, simply position your thumbs horizontally and connect the tips of each thumb. Point both index fingers upwards. You decide the height of the goal posts on the field is based on how high or low you place your fingers.
To make a goal post, bend two straws and tape the bent edges together to form a “U” shape. Cut a small X incision in the bottom of a paper cup. Stick the firm end of another bendy straw into the hole and tape it into place. Wrap the bent part of the straw around the base of the “U” made from the first two straws, and tape that into place. Now you have a field goal you can place down wherever and whenever needed., Keeping score is what makes any game competitive and in turn, more fun! Use a sheet of notebook paper or construction paper to write down the scores of you and your opponent. Decide on whether you want to end the game by time or by score.Draw a line vertically down the center of the paper, and a horizontal line towards the top to make a T. Write the name of each player or team at the top of each column. Tally the points throughout the game in the respective columns.Winner can be whoever gets to 35 points first or whoever has the most points after 15 minutes. Adjust the score limit or timeframe to your liking.

, Each player attempts to get the football to their opponent’s side. You decide how many attempts each player is allowed. Pushing the football across can be considered cheating, so it depends on how you and your opponent would like to play.


To get the ball across, place the football on your side of the field so that one corner is slightly off the edge of the surface. Then “flick” the corner of the ball hanging off the side with your index finger. When the football is down the field and you are allowed another attempt, you can lightly tap it forward with your index and middle fingers.
Flip a coin to decide who starts first.

, Once you get the football to your opponent’s side in the allotted attempts, you are in touchdown territory. In order to score a touchdown, one part of the football must hang off the opponent’s edge.


A touchdown is worth 6 points, if you want to follow actual football guidelines. Yet, if you want to keep the game simple, make each touchdown 1 point.To double check if the football did in fact hang over the edge to score a touchdown, bend down so that you can look upwards at the bottom of the surface edge and the football. This angle will make it easier to determine if a piece of the football is past the edge.

, Once you score a touchdown, you can kick a field goal to get extra points. Have your opponent do finger goal posts, or place down the goal post you made, at their side of the field. If you can kick the football between the goalposts, you get 3 points if following football guidelines or 1 point if keeping the game simple.


To kick a field goal, place the football vertically, pressing one point with your index finger onto the surface. Hold it there to keep it steady, and when you are ready, flick the football with your free index finger towards the goal posts., You can use notebook or printer paper to make your football. If you want to be more creative, use colored construction paper, such as brown, to make it look more like a football., After folding, make sure the folded paper is placed vertically in front of you, with the opening facing right. You only need one half sheet to make one football. Feel free to make another one with your extra sheet.


If you want your football to be more sturdy, or contained, tape down or glue the edges of the folded paper together.

, Take the bottom right corner and bring the point towards the left edge, this will form a triangle at the bottom of the paper. Repeat until one fold is left to make a complete triangle. Insert the remaining corner into the folds of the football.To add some flare, draw on some black lines to mimic the stitching found on actual footballs.

A shot will get taken if the number of the card underneath matches the number rolled on the dice.
Players can sit or stand in a circle around the playing surface.

, The first player rolls the two dice on the table or flat surface.


The first player can volunteer, or you can choose a fun way to pick who has the first turn, like the youngest person in the group, the winner of a rock-paper-scissors battle, or whoever got out of bed earliest that morning., The player drinks the shot on top of the card with the same number as they rolled. If there is more than one card with the number you rolled, just take one of the shots and leave the rest for other players who might roll that number on their turn. Count aces as low (value of 1) and face cards as follows: Jack=11, Queen=12, King=13. Because you can’t roll a 1 or a 13 with two dice, you can make up a rule for who has to take a shot that’s on an Ace or King card, like any player who spills a drink or some other “party foul.”
If there is no card out that corresponds to the number you rolled, roll again until you get an available number, or take a shot that’s on an Ace or King card if there is one out.

, Once a player rolls, don’t let him or her smell or examine their shot too closely before they take it; they must drink it right away.


Players can bluff about what type of drink they got if they want to throw other players off as to how many alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are left in the game. For example, if someone takes an alcoholic shot and makes that known with a face or an exclamation about it, everyone will know that there is one less alcoholic drink on the table for future turns.

, The person to the left of the first player goes next. Repeat the process of rolling the dice and drinking the shot on a corresponding number card.


As the number of shots left gets smaller and smaller, players roll on their turn until they get the number that corresponds to a card that still has a shot. The round ends when all of the shots are gone.

, The last player to take an alcoholic shot in the round refills all of the shot glasses for the next round. They can be responsible for deciding what alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks go into the shots for the round."

You need to have one person be in control of the music for each round of musical chairs that you play. This person will be responsible for starting and stopping the music.;
, Musical chairs is a game that needs a lot of space in order to play it. Make sure you have a wide open space in a room or outside to easily play the game. You need enough space to have chairs set up in a circle and room for the players to walk around the outside of them., To play musical chairs, you need to have chairs or seats set up in a circle. You should start with one less chair than the amount of players playing. So for example, if there are 5 people playing, you should have 4 chairs in a circle.Set up the chairs with the seat of the chair facing the outside of the circle.
If you don’t have chairs, you can use stools, carpet squares, or pillows instead.

, As soon as the music starts playing, the players walk in a circle around the chairs. You can choose whether to go clockwise or counterclockwise, but all players should go the same direction following the person in front of them.


Players should walk at a comfortable pace around the chairs without slowing down.

, After some time, the teacher, or host should stop the music. When the music stops, each player needs to find a chair to sit down in. There will be one player left without a chair to sit in because there is one less chair than players., The player that didn’t find a chair to sit it is out of the game. They can help run the music, or just watch the fun and wait to see who ends up as the winner.

, After the person who didn’t find a chair leaves the game, you need to remove one chair to play another round. Start another round by playing the music and having the players walk around the chairs again.

, After each round of musical chairs, remove a chair, keeping 1 less chair the players in the circle. The last round will be 2 players and one chair. The player who sits in the chair this round is the winner., One fun variation on musical chairs is to play it by having players find specific chairs to sit in. Before playing, have the players use a nametag to put their name on a chair. Like traditional musical chairs, they walk around the chairs when the music plays, but when it stops, the players have to try and find the chair with their name on it to sit in. The last person to find and sit in their chair is out. Remove their chair and start again to play the next round.


For this version you will have the same number of chairs as players each round.

, You can make regular musical chairs more interesting by adding different rules to each round you play. For example, you might have the person who gets out become the music player after round 1, and then after round 2 the person who doesn’t find a chair gets to call out a color and anyone wearing it has to be out.This is a fun way to have a game go more quickly when you have a lot of players.
You can come up with lots of different rules to try out.

, You can make musical chairs even more fun by having the players travel around the chairs in a different fashion each round. Having the players skip or crawl around the chairs will add another element of skill to the game. Make a list of different ways the players can travel around the chairs, and you can pick a different one each round.Run
Skip
Hop on one foot
Dance
Gallop
Walk on your tippy toes

Divide your guests into two equal teams.,
Have them each write down three words or phrases on the paper.,
Once they have written down their 3 secret phrases, have them fold the papers and put them into the bowl.

,
Do the first ""Taboo"" round.,
Do the second ""Password"" round.,
Do the third ""Charades"" round.",How to Play Fish Bowl," Then, pass out a piece of paper and a writing utensil to each guest.;
, The phrases can be anything they want them to be. Tell them to keep in mind that each player will have to guess these phrases at some point during the game.

,, During round one, each team will have one minute to guess the phrases in the bowl using rules similar to Taboo. The team should choose a member to go first.


One at a time, each teammate will try to get his or her team to guess the phrase or word on the paper using words or phrases as hints, which cannot be any of the words on the paper. The current player giving hints will continue to try to get his or her team to guess until the timer stops.
Once the timer stops, pass the bowl to the next team and have them repeat the same thing.
Pass the bowl back and forth between teams until each phrase has been guessed.

, This next round will use the same rotation concept as the first. Place all of the papers back into the bow to restart. In this road, teammates will try to guess the paper phrases by having their chosen teammate give them a one word hint as a password to guess the phrase.


For example, if the paper says Jennifer Aniston, the player could say “Celebrity” or “Friends.”

, In the last round, the person will need to act out with motions as hints for the phrase on the paper. They are not allowed to use any verbal aid whatsoever.


For example, if the phrase is “playing basketball” the individual can act out dribbling a ball or shooting it into the hoop. At the end of the round, whoever has the most points is the winner. Make it more competitive by adding in a prize for the winning team.

Set up the game.,
Begin to play speed quarters.,
Determine the loser of each round.,
Give the loser a second chance.,
End the game.",How to Play Quarters2," A drinking glass is placed in the center of the table, filled with the alcohol of choice. There should be at least four players around the table. Two players on opposite sides of the table are chosen to start at the same time, and each is given a quarter and a cup. Make sure that each of the players is separated by an equal amount of space between one another., Each player must attempt to successfully bounce his or her quarter into a cup as quickly as possible. If a player misses, the player must quickly try again. As soon as a player gets their quarter into the cup, they pass the quarter and the cup to the player on their right. If a player shoots the quarter into the cup on the first try, then he may pass it to any player at the table., The goal of the game is to try and get one of your opponents to have both cups and quarters at the same time. If a player ever has both quarters at the same time, then that player is the loser. The player who passes the second cup to the opponent with the other cup is said to have ""screwed"" the loser.However, it is not good enough to simply pass the cup to the opponent with the other cup. You must stack the cup inside your opponent's cup.
This action serves to prevent the loser from attempting another shot, since oftentimes the loser is unaware that their opponent has ""screwed"" them.

, At this point, the loser is allowed one final shot into the stacked cups. If the loser misses, he or she must drink the penalty beverage, which is often a shot or a large portion (perhaps all) of an alcoholic drink. If the loser makes the final shot, then the tables have been turned on the other players.Some rules insist that all other players take penalty drinks, others require only the player who ""screwed"" the loser to drink. Sometimes the player who ""screwed"" the loser is given a single shot just like the loser had, and the two take turns shooting until someone misses.
Another option for the penalty beverage is that the player who ""screwed"" the loser is allowed to spin a quarter, and the loser has to drink a beer or a mixed drink for as long as the quarter remains standing. In the case where the loser makes the final shot, she must then spin a quarter and everyone else drinks for as long as the loser allows it to spin.

, The game ends when everyone decides to mutually quit playing, or everyone is too intoxicated to continue playing. However, you can make up your own rules as to how to end the game. Some versions of the game make it so that a player is eliminated after losing five times. You continue until the last person is standing."

Set up the game.,

Ending the game.",How to Play Quarters3," Fill a cup up with alcohol of your choosing, and place it in the middle of the table. This cup is known as the ""big chug."" Place a cup around the big chug for every player that is playing the game. Fill each of these cups up with alcohol as well. Assign each of the cups around the big chug to each of the players. Each player is to memorize where their cup is placed around the big chug., A player attempts to bounce a quarter towards the cups at the center of the table. If the player misses entirely, he or she must drink the contents of their cup. The quarter then passes to the next player on his or her right. If however the player makes it into one of the opponent's cups, that opponent must drink the contents of their cup., If a player bounces the quarter, and it lands in the big chug, new rules kick into place. Every player must pick up their cup of alcohol and drink. The last person to finish their drink must then drink the entire contents of the big chug., This game is typically ended when people are either tired of playing, or too inebriated to continue playing. However, you can establish a point system if you wish to determine a winner. If you bounce the quarter into an opponent's cup, you get 1 point. If you miss all of the cups, you get no points. If you get it in the big chug, you lose 1 point. Finally, the person to lose the big chug drinking challenge loses 2 points."

Divide the rest of the players between two tables.,
Divide each table into teams.,

Give each table what they'll need to play.",How to Play Bunco1," Players roll dice and accumulate ‘wins’ (or ""buncos"".) The person with the most wins or Buncos at the end of the game is the winner., Each round correlates to a number on the die; the first round correlates with the one on the die, round two correlates with the two, etc. If a player rolls the dice and gets three of the number that the round correlates to, the person gets a bunco.



Example: If it is round four and the player rolls the dice and three of them land on four, that player gets a bunco.

, Bunco is played with 12 people because it is divisible by four.If you are playing with more or less than 12 people, make sure that you are playing with enough people so that there are four players at each table.
If you are playing with an odd amount of people, assign a “ghost” to someone. The partner of the “ghost” rolls and keeps score for the “ghost”. Essentially one person on the team with an uneven number gets to roll and keep score twice.

, The head table controls the pace of the game. The game begins with the head table rings the bell. To pick the players who will be at the head table:


Collect all 12 score sheets. Assign someone to draw small stars on four of the card sheets.
Shuffle the sheets. Have each player select a sheet. Those who pick sheets with stars are the players who will begin at the head table.

, There should be four people at each table. A typical Bunco game consists of three tables--one “losing” table, one “middle” table and one head table. The head table is the best, the middle is middle, and the losing table is worst.

, People across from each other are teammates. However, keep in mind that this will change every round.

, This person will play the game, but will also be in charge of keeping track of points for the team he/she is on.

, Each table should have a spiral notebook to write the score in, 3 dice, a score sheet for each player, and a pencil for each of the four people at the table."

, You can include forests, mountains, rivers, lakes, and more. Remember to consider the geological history of the land.

An ice age would cause glaciers that carve U-shaped valleys into the land and tectonic faults would cause mountain ranges like the Andes or fold mountains like the Alps, depending on how they form and how they differ in composition. This can help when distributing resources.

For example: An extremely advanced civilization has 30 people and 10 working machines that produce weapons (so an overall total of 40 actions, 10 which must be used to craft weapons). After all actions are spent, your turn is over. Note that actions can't be saved. Actions are divided into the following types:

Test out new ideas.",How to Play Cards Against Humanity," You can only look at your own hand of cards. Leave the rest of the white ""answer"" cards and black ""question"" cards separated into face-down stacks.


You need at least four players to play Cards Against Humanity. There's no upper limit to how many people can play, but it's most fun with 6–8 players.;
, The official rules say that the ""person who most recently pooped"" is the first ""Card Czar."" (This might give you an idea of what the game will be like.) If you prefer, the person with the next upcoming birthday can go first instead. That player starts the round by turning over the top card in the black ""questions"" stack. Read the card aloud and leave it face up on the table.

, The Card Czar waits while each other player chooses one card from their hand. The goal is to pick the funniest answer to the black question card, or the answer the Card Czar will like most. Put the selected white cards in a face down pile.


If the black card says ""Pick 2,"" choose two white cards from your hand. Keep them in the order the Czar should read them.

, Now the Card Czar picks up the white answer cards and shuffles them, so no one knows who put down which card. Reread the black answer card, then read the white cards one by one, putting them face up on the table.

, The Card Czar chooses their favorite answer to the question. The player who played the winning card gets one ""Awesome Point."" The easiest way to track points is to give the black question card to the winning player.


All players can talk while the Card Czar is deciding, and try to influence the decision.
Set aside all the white cards from that round into a discard pile.

, Each player draws back up to ten white cards. The person sitting to the Card Czar's left becomes the Czar for the next round, picking a new black card.


Alternatively, you can appoint whoever won the last round as the new Czar. This doesn't work well if there's a newcomer in the group, since it's harder to win rounds if you don't know the Czar's style of humor.

, This is a casual, non-competitive game, and people usually play until they get tired of it. If you want a more defined end point, play until one player gets five points (or 7–10 for a longer game). Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.


One fun way to end the game is to use the ""haiku"" black card for the final round. You don't need to find the actual card: it just says ""Make a haiku."" The other players each choose three cards from their hand to use as an answer.
Some players stop drawing new cards when they announce the end, but keep playing until they run out of cards.This leads to (even more) absurd nonsense answers.

, If you agree to play with this rule, any answerer can gamble one point after the Czar reads the question card. That player then puts two answers into the pile instead of one. Whoever wins the round wins the extra point as well.

, The game tends to get less interesting when players are stuck with a bunch of cards they don't like. Some playgroups like to add one of these rules to prevent that situation:


Anyone can spend a point to discard any number of cards and draw back up to ten.Everyone can discard any number of cards and draw up to ten when the haiku card is played (before answering).The first player to reach 3 points wins. Deal out new hands to start the next game.

, If you're playing with a large group, the Card Czar can choose three winners. Award three points to the Czar's favorite answer, two points to the second best, and one point to number three.

, Instead of taking turns judging the answers, have everyone play an answer card every round. Players then vote on the winner. This works well if you are playing with strangers, who would have trouble choosing cards targeted for a specific person.


Alternatively, if you want to avoid ties, take turns eliminating cards until only one is left.

, If you love Cards Against Humanity but you've memorized all the cards, there are many expansions to shuffle into your set, plus special editions that change US pop culture references for the UK, Australia, and Canada. You can order these from the Cards Against Humanity website, or find them in most board game stores.


If that's not enough, there are many unofficial expansions you can purchase or print out from online. Or you could make your own — all it takes is a pen and two colors of paper.

, Hardcore CAH fans might enjoy the online laboratory. The website will show you a random selection of cards and ask you to pick the funniest one. If you give the creators good feedback, your favorites from the site could end up in the next expansion.

Wait to see who gets the raw egg.,
Award a prize.",How to Play Egg Roulette," The usual amount is 6, as a game of real roulette would have. However, you can vary this depending on the guest amount. It is recommended not to go any higher though, as the suspense gets spoiled and it's best to divide people into smaller groups instead.;
, Refrigerate all of the eggs, so that it is hard to impossible to tell which have been boiled.

,, Ask them for an order or impose one on them, depending on what works best for your party. Each player much come to the table or bench where the eggs are and choose an egg. Then, the player must crack the egg against his or her forehead to see if they've selected the one that is raw.


Inform players to be careful, as a hard boiled egg can hurt!
It also helps to divert too much examination of the eggs by a player by letting them know that they must only choose an egg by sight and that once they've picked it up, they must go ahead and smash it against their head, even if they suspect it's the raw one.

, Be ready with face towels, paper towels and wipes.

, It's pretty tough getting egg all over your face. Be sure to cheer up the unfortunate winner with a sweet prize. Make it so nice that everyone else will wish they'd scored the raw egg.

Finish round one.,
Winning teams write a W on their cards.,
Switch partners.,
Continue playing.,
Keep score.,
Determine the winner.",How to Play Bunco2," One person at the table will take the three dice and roll them. They will want to get as many 1s as possible, as this is Round 1.


For each 1 that he/she roll, they get one point unless they roll three 1s, which would be a 21 (the highest amount of points possible). This is called a ""bunco"", hence the name of the game. When a player gets a bunco, they should yell ""Bunco!"" Mark a hash mark on the player’s card that got the bunco.
If the player rolls three of a kind, but they're not 1s, he/she gets five points, but not a bunco.

, When he/she doesn’t get the number, the dice is passed to the left. For example, in the first round, if a player rolls the dice and gets a 3, 4, and 6, he/she must pass the dice to the next player because none of those dice were 1s.The dice must also be passed as soon as a player scores 21 points. This could either be achieved by getting a bunco or rolling the dice so that at least one of the die is the number needed and adding that to the existing score.

, When a team from the head table gets 21 points or more, the round is over. That team must yell out “game!” The scorekeeper at the head table rings the bell to signify the end of the round. The team at each table with the most points is the winner of that round for each individual table.


Players can finish up the roll that they started when the bell was rung.
If there is a tie between teams at a table, one person from each team must roll one die. The person who rolls the highest number wins for his/her team.

, Losing teams (those with fewer points) write an L on their cards. Shift teams accordingly.


The winning team at the head table stays at the head table. The losing team at the head table goes down to the middle table.
The winning team at the middle table moves up to the head table. The losing team moves down to the losing table.
The winning team at the losing table moves up to the middle table. The losing team stays at the losing table.

, You do not have to do this, but it makes the game more lively. Once each team has moved to the appropriate table, switch partners so that you make up a whole new team.

, Move to round two (the new number that the teams must hope to roll is 2.) There are six rounds in Bunco. Playing all the way to round 6 completes one hand of the game.

, You should keep score by a team (you and the person you're facing) and individually (how many buncos you've gotten).

, After all of the rounds are over, each player should count up the number of buncos they have, as well as how many wins and losses. You can either play that the person with the most buncos wins, or the person with the most buncos and ‘wins’ wins. Award prizes accordingly."

Disappear for a while on the night of the full moon.,
Be very protective of the ones you love.,
Walk like a wolf.,
Practice three different stares.,
Target someone who loves wolves or is very connected with animals.,
After a full moon night, put some dirt and leaves on your clothes and hair.,
At places with many people, move as if you're hunting.,
When you sleep, sleep in wolf positions.,
Hang out with canines more than with people.,
Comment on smells.,
If someone accuses you of being a werewolf, deny it quickly.,
If you are a boy, let your hair grow so it looks like you are quite furry.",How to Pretend to Be a Werewolf," Werewolves are known for their distinctive transformation if they sleep outside with the full moon's light shining directly on their face.


Appear worried on the night of a full moon. Remember, you have to change that night. Do not make people think that something really bad is happening and don't lie. So, just excuse yourself and disappear somewhere where no one can find you. (If you're younger, let your parents know, though or they might freak out and call someone.)
Never stay around other people on a full moon night. If someone calls you when the moon is up, don't answer. But answer every time when they call you at other times during the month. That behavior will make it easier for them to spot that something is wrong with you and you have changed.;
, Just make sure not to thrash out or terribly injure someone. Wolves are always very protective and help the pack in any way they can.

, This will depend on what wolf you want to be. The Alpha? Stand tall and walk with pride. Look up wolves and packs and ranks and how each rank acts. But every rank walks wolf-like. They can't help it because that's their nature. And since you are a werewolf, you're more used to that. It's like walking while wearing high heels. It will be uncomfortable, but it will not harm your feet and you will get used to it as you continue walking this way.

, Werewolves can look menacing and outright scary if they're angry. Practice putting on several different stares to perfect the impersonation.


One for your enemies. Make it deep and aggressive. Look straight into their eyes and charge around them. Smile at them with your mouth open. When wolves do that, it's a sign of challenge.
The other one for your prey. Charge around your prey while observing very slight movement they make. Even if they move their feet a bit or just their finger. Spot it and make that clear. (Do not try smiling with your mouth open with this, since there is not going to be an equal fight. I don't mean that you are going to fight your prey or attack it, but that's how wolves are.)
Last one, for interesting people and friends. Try to make it friendly and playful. Wolves are very playful with their friends.

, If there is no one like that, target your best friend. Creep around in places they are and stalk them, but don't scare them! Think that you are a wolf and you are their protector. Keep a close eye on them and make eye contact. In the beginning, they might be scared a little bit if they don't know you. But prove to them that you are a friend and make them feel safe around you.

, That will give an impression that you have been in the forest. If someone tells you, act scared and excuse yourself.

, Be sneaky. Keep your head a bit low and observe everyone's moves. Charge around them as if they are your prey.

, For example, curl up in a ball in a dark corner. Or lay with both hands and legs straight in front of you, like walking using all limbs. Except this time you're laying on your side.

, Don't break away from friends altogether, but if you were a werewolf you would feel more comfortable around canines. If you are hanging out way too much, you might also start smelling a bit like fur which is very good for your tries.

, Don't be cheesy though! Only do that if you're good at acting.

, Act angry and a bit worried. Give them the ""Enemy look"" and tell them never to bring up the subject again and leave. Don't get in a fight about it.

, Werewolves are known for their very hairy exteriors. If you want to start producing more hair (and you're a guy), you can try shaving and see if that helps you produce more hair.

Then you will need a proper costume.,
Create your costume.,
Find an arch nemesis.,
The penultimate step is to pick a fitting name.,
Finally you need some superpowers.",How to Pretend to Be a Superhero1," No hero is complete without a cape or a mask. Make sure it is as bright as possible. A superhero is no camouflage wearing commoner. Try running in an open area to get used of the cape hanging from your shoulders

, This is almost as crucial as the step above. Your costume should have an overall theme. Are you a popular to women and children alike superhero or a vigilante hidden in the shadows? You'll have to design something that catches the eye. It should have a color theme similar to your cape. Also add some insignia, a logo, or a Latin phrase somewhere on your costume. It ought to be easily recognizable and unique to you alone. No two superheroes are similar! If you need to hide your face (to protect your loved ones or just yourself from humiliation) then don't forget to create a mask as well.

, And since you're most likely not adept at tailoring purchase the necessary fabrics and hand them over to a tailor to create the costume of your dreams.

, A hero has to have persistent foe. Did that old man who took his dog for a walk in the park rubbed you the wrong way? Punch him! That guy bullied you again? Promptly humiliate him in front of the whole school (any prank works wonders). But in the end of the day whoever you decide to be your ancestral enemy don't forget to pick a fight with him/her as often as you can. After all they can't be your arch enemies unless they loathe you.

, This step is also extremely crucial. A name should reflect your alignment. Are you benevolent or malevolent? Law abiding or vigilante? Also it should hint at your superpowers. Also if you feel like it add a title to your name (i.e. Captain or General). And above all be serious with the naming procedure. Wildlife Lover is no good name for your bloodthirsty alter ego.

, Your superpowers don't have to be some sort of mind blowing body characteristic (like superhuman strength or hypersonic speed). Batman is a good example. A few sophisticated mechanical devices can easily do the trick. Below you will find tips on how to get some of the most common superpowers as well as ideas for some generic ones.

Ask another person to choose a number.,
Count the number of letters in the number that they have chosen.,
If you're doing this in a group, involve everyone.",How to Play the Cosmos Game1," This can be a friend, part of a group, or a person you're trying to confuse. You can ask them for a number between one and ten to start, or, if you're playing with more than one other person, allow them to choose any number.;
, Tell them that that number is cosmos. For example, they might choose six. Since the word ""six"" has three letters in it, three is cosmos. Tell them, ""Six is three and three is cosmos.""

, Form a circle and have each person chose a number and find out its Cosmos. See who can guess the pattern first.


When playing this game in a group, it's much more fun to go to higher numbers than 10.

, It could be in the middle of the living room, or be in a room by itself.

, You can pick up items around the house, such as pens and paper. Or, you could make things like clothing or cookies.

, You could name the store after yourself (""Joe's Store) or after the focus of your store (""Grocery-Mart""). It's up to you to be creative!

, Make a sign with your store's name and place it in a visible location. Use a coffee table or a blanket on the floor to put your items on. Use a toy cash register, jar, or box to put money in.

, Some can be as reasonable as $1 each to as crazy as $550,000! Make small paper signs for each item, stating the price.

, Hand out flyers, hang signs around the house, or make a poster and place it outside your store.

, Make sure you split it among them evenly. Encourage them to buy items. Make sure to give them correct change!

, Be sure to clean up after yourself.

Use paper money to pay the bill.",How to Play Restaurant," Decide what material you're going to use to build the restaurant. From cardboard to wood to felt, there are many materials you can use to create a restaurant. You may already have a Fisher Price kitchen and a set of plastic chairs with a table. If you don't, be creative about it. There are tons of possibilities, such as: You can repurpose an empty shelf with drawers and create a service window, just like in a real restaurant.
You can use silver spray paint to create “stainless steel” appliances.
You can create a restaurant made out of paint and cardboard.
You can make a blanket fort that can be the kitchen, and serve your customers through a blanket curtain.
You don’t necessarily need to build an actual restaurant. Use your imagination to transform a couch into a serving area and a low table into the kitchen area.;
, Brainstorm with your parent to come up with a snappy name for the restaurant. It could incorporate your name, such as Sarah’s Market or Colby’s Corner. Or it could be named after your favorite superhero (Batman’s Bistro?) or their favorite animated character (Dora’s Cafe?).


Once you decide on the name, create a sign displaying the name. Color in the sign and decorate it, and practice your handwriting by writing the sign yourself (with your parent's help, of course).

, Decide if the restaurant is going to be open in the morning, in the afternoon, or at night. Or all day, every day. The hours of the restaurant may affect the types of food the restaurant serves, such as coffee in the morning and spaghetti at night.


Of course, you can decide to serve whatever type of food you like, no matter the time of day. This is pretend, after all!

, If you're feeling really creative, work with your parent to create a menu by hand. Decide on simple items, maybe three or four total, so its easy for them to write down.


A more versatile approach would be to type up a blank menu and laminate it. Then, you can use dry erase markers to write down the menu for the day.
Also, with the help of your parent, you can work at the computer to come up with a typed menu together, play with font and color, and print out a custom menu for the restaurant. You can also use clip art or photos of food from magazines and glue them to the menu.
If you decide to use the computer to create the menu, create another document to make a mock up of a receipt. It will make the paying aspect of playing restaurant seem more real, and add another fun element to the game., Do you want to serve Italian food at their restaurant, Chinese food, Mexican food, or a combination of many foods. Talk with your parent about foods that go with a certain country or theme. An Italian menu could feature spaghetti, pizza, and meatballs. A Mexican menu could feature tacos, beans, nachos, and enchiladas. Or you may want a menu of your favorite foods, such as grilled cheese sandwiches, mac n’ cheese, or chicken wings.


You can break down the menu into entrees, sides, desserts, and beverages. This may make it easier to decide how many items should go on their menu.

, Usually there are separate foods for kids and foods for adults. But it's your restaurant, so it is up to you how you want to present the food on their menu.


If you're a parent helping to plan the menu, try to sneak in some healthy items on the menu, if possible. Make suggestions like sliced apples instead of French fries, milk instead of soda, a fruit cup as a side, or a smoothie as a beverage option. Look for ways to use the restaurant game to keep your children entertained and educate them on food.

, Fill up the back side of the menu with games like crossword puzzles, mazes, riddles, and ready-to-color pictures. This adds another fun part of the play restaurant experience!


You can also create placemats and napkins for the table to match the design of the menu.

, Felt food is great for play. It usually comes in a kit themed around a certain meal or cuisine,There are no sharp corners when you use felt food and you can combine different toppings to make different foods.

, Play dough is another great option. It is easy to mold and safe to eat if accidentally ingested, though you should avoid taking a big bite of a play dough sandwich. Use wooden sticks to create play dough corn dogs or popsicles. Or help your child arrange different colored play dough on a plate to create different meals.Get creative and add textures to the play dough to create different foods. If you don’t get it quite right on the first try, simply roll up the play dough and start over.

, If you are looking to get really crafty, gather up a few sheets of colored paper, a pair of scissors, and some glue. Work with your parent to create different foods out of paper.


Watch out for paper cuts and sharp corners!

, You and your parent can both pretend to hold cups of coffee and eat invisible slices of pie. The possibilities are endless when you use your imagination!


Think about how to prepare the ""imaginary"" ingredients, including washing, slicing, and dicing the ""food"".
Describe the ""imaginary"" dishes on the table to your parent, including specific ingredients in each food item or beverage.

, Take turns rotating the roles in a restaurant. Ask a parent or a sibling to get involved and fulfill one of the roles.Practice how you would act as the customer, the server, and the cook with the menus and the play food. But don’t worry too much about sticking to a realistic restaurant scene. Just have fun and get creative in each role.

, Nothing reinforces table manners to a child like a parent sitting straight, eating slowly with their utensils, and dabbing their mouth with a napkin. Act out good table etiquette so your child can learn from your example.

, Once the meal is over, someone has to pay up! Dig out the monopoly money to pay the server for the delicious pretend meal. Or make a card out of cardboard to charge your account.


Don’t forget to incorporate the pretend receipt you made into the paying of the bill. And of course, don’t forget to reward a great pretend meal at your restaurant with a good tip.

Choose what to include in the pretend school.,
Set up the classroom.,
Invite your siblings, friends or relatives to play with you.,
Choose your teaching name.,
Pick the grade level you'll be teaching or learning.,
Get a teacher's grade book.,
Ask the students to bring a binder OR notebook, a bag, a pencil, and a book to read if they finish their work early.,
Create a schedule for your students.,
Print or make your own worksheets and such things for the students.,
Have a reward system.,
Have a snack prepared to munch on while on break.,
Make sure your students are having fun and not sleeping in class.",How to Play School at Home," For example, have a classroom, library, and maybe a principal's office.
, Include a bathroom (You can also have this down the hall), a teacher's desk, desks for the students, and a board.


Outside the room, you'll need a library, a cafeteria, the principal's office, and a hall.
Have a recess bell, to tell your students when recess is over, or you could use a whistle.
Set up a white board or blackboard, or just use paper. If you're just in a house to teach, use a computer, go to the ""Notepad"" program.. Format size 72, font: Times New Roman. You could also visit the ""Paint"" program and fill with color black, and use the eraser to draw or write.
Have a sign-out sheet for any reason the students have to leave.

, Don't make someone to play with you if they don't want to. You can also play alone with some stuffed teddys.


Teachers: Decide with your friends who will be the teacher/s. If you can't figure out who to be the teacher/s play rock, paper, scissors and then take turns in a little bit. Have them write on a whiteboard, use a pointer, and assign small problems. Act like a real teacher.
Students: You can use a small tote bag or a backpack to keep things like pencils, notebooks,and other things you'll use in. Raise your hand and behave or be the ""bad kid"" for the day.

, Put a sign in front of the door that says what your teaching name will be and a classroom number.


When you make up your own name it can be serious or silly. It may be fun to come up with a silly name to depict your teaching 'personality'. For example, if you want to be a mean teacher, you can use a name that is unpleasant or the name of a fictional mean teacher in a book. You could be a dreamy teacher, with a proper name.







, If you are teaching every subject at once, then you probably will not need a grade. If teaching high or middle school, choose a subject.

, You'll use this for keeping attendance, the timetables, behavior codes and grades. You should probably draw out the plans for that day. If you are teaching P.E., track the students' progress.

, Also, have the students bring a packed lunch. No worries, if your student doesn't have a packed lunch, you can fix them a lunch!

, You can create full schedules to tell your students which classes they will be attending. Make sure that you include the academic classes like arithmetic, as well as the fun ones like art or choir (for choir you can use sing-alongs on YouTube)


Classes: Math, language arts, science, social studies, P.E, maybe even get out some books and have your class go to the library.

, You can write them yourself, or use old ones that you did not get to finish.


If you want, you can use some of your old school workbooks for the students so you don't have to spend a lot of time making up work for them. That makes it so you know what you're talking about. Of course, you'll have to use the pages that you haven't used.

, If your students do good deeds, get an answer correct (When doing work together as a class), add a gold star to a chart, or make a mark by their name and they can get a special treat! Also reward them if they do good with a substitute teacher. Don't reward them if they are naughty. Get some stickers, or candy to give to the students for good work, answers or behavior.


Make a misbehaving list. If the students misbehave, they'll have their name added to the list, which will result in loss of privileges - perhaps a timeout or no recess. You could even print out thinking sheets and tell the student to think about what they've done and write it down. You could even make the child stay after school and clean the classroom or give the student extra homework. If the child is very bad, pretend to call the parent(s) and find what punishment will be best for the situation.







, The classic teacher always has an apple, so bonus points for you if you have one as well. Plus, they're healthy!


Recess: After you've been playing for a while, have a break. Play a few games, have a snack, and then after recess is over switch teachers and students to keep the game fun.

, If your students won't listen, write a note home and make a pretend mother or father to sign keep them in the classroom during recess.

The air element is small dashes across a square area.The dashes are light blue in color. The earth element is like a small wedge of land.The bottom is brown like dirt and the top is green like grass.
Water and fire are both easily recognized. Fire’s icon is a small, red flame and water is a white icon shaped like a droplet.;

Say, ""Four is cosmos."",
Repeat with more starting numbers and more people until they get it.",How to Play the Cosmos Game2," Again, it can be helpful to restrict them to a number between one and ten, but it can also be more fun to let them choose any number.

, If they chose six, which has three letters in them, the new number will be three. Tell them, ""Six is three.""

, If the new number above was three (because ""six"" has three letters), this becomes the old number, and the new number will become the number of letters in the old number. Since ""three"" has five letters, the new number is five. Tell them, ""Three is five.""

, Since five, the new number from above, has four letters, the new number is four. Say, ""Five is four."" Then, since you've reached four, you can stop.

, The word ""four"" has four letters in it, so if you didn't stop here, you'd be saying ""four is four"" forever. Instead, simply say ""four is cosmos,"" and have you friends try to figure out why four is cosmos - it's the only number that works this way.


The whole round for this example would work like this: the other person chooses six, so you say, ""Six is three, and three is five, and five is four, and four is cosmos."" The starting number doesn't matter; this will work with any number they give you, even numbers above ten.

, Make them figure out why four is cosmos and how the whole trick works. Make them do it for you before you tell them if they're right.

And most important of all have fun!,
Don't forget to clean up afterwards!",How to Make Your Room Into a Restaurant (for Kids)," You can serve pre-made snacks like popcorn, juice, and other little munchies, or you can make your own foods like sandwiches. Whatever you're making, you want to make sure you have enough, and that your guests know what you have.


Be sure you have clean hands when you prepare the food, for you want to prevent damaging someone's health. Plus, no one wants to eat unhygienic, gross food!;
, You want it to be something catchy, like something that rhymes, or is alliterated. Alliteration is when words start with the same letter (ex. Yvonne's Yummies, Fun Foods, etc..)

, You have two choices :


Write it by hand. This is fun because you can design it a lot easier, with exactly what you want it to look like.
Make it on the computer. It will look more professional, and your computer probably has a program where you can pick a menu design and just add your own text. Ask your mom, dad, or whoever owns the computer you're using if the computer has a program like this.

, Don't just assign it randomly, but see what they want to do so that people don't end up with hurt feelings. If somebody got a job that someone else wanted, you can take turns, so that one shift Jessie is chef, and the next shift Savannah is. Another way to fix this is that each job has multiple people. You can also make up fun parts for people who don't already have any. For example, the special Entertainer, who dances while people wait for their food, or does magic tricks.

, First, get small stools, end tables, or even boxes, to use as tables. For chairs, you can use pillows, or just small chairs, depending on the size of the table. Draw pictures of food to tape up on the walls, and get coloring pages and crayons for impatient customers.


If you have a TV or computer in the room, turn on a video and put it in a corner. Put it on MUTE, and it will keep customers occupied. If you have a chalkboard or dry-erase board, you can put up some special food items.
If you don't have either of these, you can get a big piece of paper and do the same. You may want to use paper or plastic plates instead of glass or porcelain plates, so they don't break.

, Make sure everyone is having a good time.

, Everyone should help put away all the restaurant supplies, vacuum the bedroom, and clean up the kitchen. This will ensure that you are allowed to do things like this again! To make cleaning more fun, put on some favorite music, or race to see who gets done first.

Knowledge of the phases of a player’s turn, and the playing of “Land” and casting of “Spells” are of particular importance. Also review and understand the concepts of “State-based Effects”, the “Stack” (or queue of “Spells” about to resolve upon casting them), and the different “Zones” involved in the game (ex: “Graveyard”, “Library”, “Battlefield”, etc.).


There are several game types that are commonly used in MTG. These include “Modern”, “Standard”, “Legacy”, “Vintage”, “Commander (EDH)”, and others. Each game type allows a different collection of cards to be used.;
, Play around on sites like MTGDeckBuilder and MTGVault. See what cards you can imagine yourself playing and what style suits the way you think.


The color(s) you will use in your MTG deck will determine which “Land” cards that you will put in the deck. You will be able to cast “Colorless” spells (spells that have no colored mana symbols in their “mana cost”) regardless of the color(s) you choose. The more colors you choose for your deck to incorporate, the higher the chance that you will encounter a situation where you will be unable to cast one or more of the spells in your hand due to lacking one (or more) of the colors of mana those spells require in their “mana cost”. Plan accordingly.
White's strengths are a roster of small creatures that are strong collectively: protecting those creatures with enchantments, gaining life, preventing damage to creatures or players, imposing restrictions on players, reducing the capabilities of opposing creatures, and powerful spells that ""equalize"" the playing field by destroying all cards of a given type. White creatures are known for their ""protection"" from various other colors, or even types of cards rendering them nearly impervious to harm from those things. Numerous white creatures also have ""First Strike"", ""Lifelink"", and ""Vigilance"". White's weaknesses include a focus on creatures, its unwillingness to simply kill creatures outright (instead hobbling them with restrictions that can be undone), and the fact that many of its most powerful spells affect all players equally—including the casting player.
Blue is best at letting a player draw additional cards; permanently taking control of an opponent's cards; returning cards to their owner's hand; and countering spells, causing them to be discarded and the Mana used to pay them wasted. Blue's creatures tend to be weaker than creatures of other colors, but commonly have abilities and traits which make them difficult to damage or block, particularly ""flying"" and to a lesser extent ""shroud"". Blue's weaknesses include having trouble permanently dealing with spells that have already been played, the reactive nature of most of its spells, and a small (and expensive) roster of creatures.
Black is best at destroying creatures, forcing players to discard cards from their hand, making players lose life, and returning creatures from the dead. Furthermore, because Black seeks to win at all costs, it has limited access to many abilities or effects that are normally available only to one of the other colors; but these abilities often require large sacrifices of life totals, creatures, cards in hand, cards in library, and other difficult-to-replace resources. Black is known for having creatures with the ability ""Intimidate"", making them difficult to block. Lesser black abilities include ""Deathtouch"" and ""Regeneration"". Black's main weaknesses are an almost complete inability to deal with enchantments and artifacts, its tendency to hurt itself almost as badly as it hurts the opponent, and difficulties in removing other Black creatures.
Red's interests include destroying opposing lands and artifacts, sacrificing permanent resources for temporary but great power, and playing spells that deal ""direct damage"" to creatures or players, usually via applications of fire. Red has a wide array of creatures, but with the exception of extremely powerful dragons, most are fast and weak, or with low toughness, rendering them easier to destroy. Some of Red's cards can turn against or hurt their owner in return for being more powerful for their cost. Red also shares the trickery theme with Blue and can temporarily steal opponents' creatures or divert spells, although generally not permanently. Many of Red's most famous creatures have the ""Haste"" trait, which lets them attack and use many abilities earlier. The ability to raise a creature's power temporarily is also common among Red's creatures. Red's weaknesses include its inability to destroy enchantments, the self-destructive nature of many of its spells, and the way in which it trades early-game speed at the cost of late-game staying power. Red also has the vast majority of cards that involve random chance.
Green has a large number of creatures, which tend to be the largest in the game for their cost. Many of its spells make them stronger temporarily. It can also destroy ""unnatural"" artifacts and enchantments, increase a player's life total, get extra lands or other mana sources into play, and produce the other four colors of mana. Green creatures often have ""Trample"", an ability which lets them deal attack damage to an opponent if blocked by a weaker creature. Green's weaknesses include its difficulty destroying creatures directly; a distinct shortage of flying creatures, and a lack of strategic options other than its signature large creatures.

,

There are five main types of non-land cards in MTG. These are “Creature”, “Sorcery”, “Instant”, “Enchantment” and “Artifact”. While it is possible to build a deck in nearly any combination of these types, the vast majority of MTG decks will have a significant number of “Creature” cards (generally between 30% and 40% of the deck) with which to “Attack” during your “Declare Attackers Phase”, “Block” during your “Declare Blockers Phase”, and to activate the various “Activated Abilities” that many creatures have printed on them. Creatures can also have “Static Abilities” printed on the card that provide a constant effect on the “Battlefield”. One main premise of building a successful MTG deck is to choose cards that will work well or elevate the abilities of one another. Choosing what type of recurrent themes to feature in your deck is central to this process and will comprise your “deck concept”. An example of a “deck concept” would be to include a large number of “Creature” cards in your deck with the “Creature Type” of “Elf” as well as abilities that support other Elves, thereby combining their effectiveness. Keep in mind that in many cases, versatility is as important as your devotion to your “deck concept”. An over-commitment to your “deck concept” may lead to your deck performing its main features very consistently at the expense of creating a glaring vulnerability in the deck. The “test draws” that you will perform later will assist you in finding a good balance between your devotion to your “deck concept” and the overall utility of your deck.
In addition to a “deck concept”, your deck will employ a “win condition”, or a set of circumstances that will lead to your victory. This will be closely tied to your “deck concept”, as the strategy you implement in your “deck concept” should, in theory, directly result in your victory. Your “win condition” can take several forms, but will ultimately result in either dealing lethal damage to your opponent(s) either through combat damage or direct damage, forcing your opponent(s) to draw a card with an empty “Library”, or playing a card (or activating an ability) that reads “You win the game”. Your deck can employ several “win conditions”.

,

Now that you have a “deck concept”, you can select the cards from your collection that will support your deck and ultimately result in your “win condition”.
Most MTG game formats have a minimum card count of 60 cards in your deck (“Commander” requires 100 total cards exactly with no repeated cards except for “Basic Lands”). There is no maximum size to your deck, however the rules state that you must be able to shuffle your “Library” in a reasonable amount of time (30 seconds or so). Depending on the exact parameters of your deck, you will need anywhere from 20% to 45% of your deck to be “Land” cards (used as a renewable currency to cast spells). Wizards of the Coast suggests a general “rule of thumb” of having “Land” cards comprise 40% of your deck. In a 60-card deck, this means you will have 24 “Land” cards, and therefore you will select 36 “Spells”.
If your “deck concept” is particularly prevalent throughout your deck, it is typically considered wise to limit your deck size to the minimum number of cards allowed in a deck in the corresponding game format. You will consequently draw the strongest cards in your deck more consistently.

,

The term “mana curve” refers to an imaginary bar graph (and the smooth curve it represents) that visually enumerates the “converted mana cost” of the cards in your deck. (The “converted mana cost” is the total number of mana required to cast each card, without respect to color.)If your “mana curve” is significantly slanted to the columns of 1 and 2, or alternatively, significantly slanted to high-number columns (5+), you may wish to review your “deck concept” and attempt to even out this disparity by replacing some of the cards you have chosen.

, Land is the most important part of your deck. if your land sucks, the deck is going to be at a disadvantage. That doesn’t mean only stock your deck with 4 Evolving wilds, 4 terra morphia expanses, 4 dual land, and 8 basic lands. Find a happy medium, and make sure that the manna ratio reflects the cards. In a reasonably sized deck you should have between 18-28 lands/mana sources.

Now that you are ready to insert “Land” cards into your deck, you must again consider the colors that you chose earlier. MTG has two main types of “Land” cards, “Basic Land” cards and “Non-basic Land” cards. Unless a “Land” card reads “Basic Land” on it, it is a “Non-basic Land”. Each “Basic Land” provides one mana to your “mana pool” when you tap it of the color on the card (the “Wastes” card provides one colorless mana. Cards with a “Wastes” symbol in their “mana cost” require that the mana used be colorless).
There are two factors to consider when adding “Land” cards to a deck that has more than one color. The first is the overall number of cards that contain each color, and the second is the total number of colored mana symbols of each type in the “mana costs” of the cards within your deck. These figures will assist you in choosing an appropriate number of “Land” cards that produce the various colors in your deck. A calculator may be useful.
The quickest way to determine how many “Land” cards of each type you should add to a deck with two or more colors is to count the total number of colored mana symbols of one type in your deck, then divide that number by the total number of colored mana symbols in your deck. This will provide a ratio you can use to add “Land” cards of that color to the deck. (Example: Deck contains 17 “Plains” mana symbols in the “mana cost” of the cards in the deck, and 38 total colored mana symbols. 17/38 = 0.447. Using that ratio, 0.447*24 (or total desired “Land” cards) = 10.7, so roughly 11 of the 24 “Land” cards in your deck should produce White mana.)
There are many “Land” cards in MTG that provide two or more colors of mana when they are tapped, or have a variety of other effects. Replacing a few “Basic Land” cards with these can have powerful effects on your deck, or simply help to make multi-color decks more reliable.

, Few creature-less decks can make it. Make sure you don't kill the economy of your deck though. If your creatures are weak, or cost too much Mana, you will die.

, Everyone wants to win, but the game gets stale and boring unless you can look in the eyes of your enemy and see the look of horror on his or her face as they realize you have killed them with 64 rat tokens.

,

The term “threading” land refers to the process of evenly spacing the “Land” cards throughout the deck (before shuffling your deck to start the game). This helps to ensure that the random element of drawing cards throughout the game will result in a proportionate number of “Land” cards to accompany your “Spells”.

,

This action is known as a “test draw”, and will provide you with a sample of what type of opening hand you can expect while playing with your new deck. After drawing seven cards, look at the top two to five cards of your “Library” to see how this hypothetical game might play out, and what options you would have in the first few turns of the game.
Due to the random nature of shuffling your deck and drawing seven cards, you should perform this step multiple times for optimal results.

,

If you find that after several “test draws”, you are lacking adequate “Land” cards in order to play the “Spells” in your hand (or the correct colors of mana), you may wish to revisit the number of “Land” cards in your deck (or their associated colors). Other problems that can arise could be a lack of an adequate number of “Creature” cards, or an inability to play any “Spells” until the fourth turn or later of the hypothetical game you established with your “test draw”.

,


Now that you’ve built your deck and compiled some information about the way that it will play in an actual game, you should research what other cards that you do not have in your collection that would support your “deck concept” and help you to finalize your deck, then consider acquiring those cards.In most game formats, you may have a maximum of four cards with the same name in your deck (the card name is the text printed at the top of the card. This rule does not include “Basic Lands”). If you find that you have less than four copies of a card that is central to your “deck concept”, you may wish to acquire and add the remaining missing copies of that card to cause your deck’s main features to function more consistently (keeping in mind the “mana curve” detailed earlier).

,

In most “Standard” and “Modern” format tournaments, a player is permitted to keep 15 cards that are not in their deck with them (outside the game). These 15 cards comprise a player’s “side-board”. Before any match, a player is allowed to replace any number of cards in their deck with cards from their “side-board”. This 15-card supplement can be used to add specific utilities or make other necessary adjustments to a player’s deck in-between matches. See How to Build a Sideboard.

You don’t want your neighbor calling the police on you because you’re firing potatoes around in your back yard. , Parts for a potato gun will cost somewhere between $20 and $40, depending on where you shop. Check the bargain areas of your local hardware supply store for great deals, or use the internet to find deals all over the world. It doesn't need to cost and arm and a leg in order to make a potato gun, but you’ll need some extra cash.

, It’s nice to have all your materials set out for you when you begin building. Your shopping list for a potato gun will include the following items.


1 grill ignition kit (The small red button on the grill that clicks)
1 4-inch diameter PVC 90 degree elbow (or just a section of four inch pipe)
1 fitting adapter for the Tee (or pipe) with threads for a cap
1 screw on cap
1 4-inch to 2-inch PVC adapter
1 4 foot long section of 2-inch PVC pipe.
2-3 few cans of aerosol deodorant (for the butane)
Some form of glue or other adhesive (optional, but recommended)
1 bag of potatoes

, Now screw the cap on it. This is a simple step – you’re basically just combining two component parts. The threaded fit adapter is the part of the pipe that has those little ridges inside of it. These are called threads. Refer to the video above for visual instructions.


You can also use glue if you worry that the pieces might stay connected. Spread some glue around the edges before connecting the two pieces. Don’t use too much.

, Move to the other side of the potato gun and fit the 4-inch to 2-inch adapter in the other end of the elbow.

Once again, you can use glue for this step if you feel more comfortable with the structural integrity of the gun.

, If it doesn't go in, lightly tap it with a hammer. Make sure it is flush when you are done. Don’t tap so hard that you break the pvc pipe.

This is one step where using glue is recommended. The barrel undergoes a lot of force when a shot is fired and it isn’t as snug of a connection as the other parts. , From here on out, the elbow will be referred to as the chamber. This is where you’ll hold your potato projectile eventually.

Make sure your chamber is neither too long nor too short. Too long of a chamber and your spud will sputter out of the chamber too slowly; too short of a chamber and the spud will disintegrate before you know it. , The spark generator is the piece of equipment you bought that will generate a spark. Try to wrap it in such a way that there is a gap between the end of the wire and the end of sparkle generator. The video will offer a visual aid if that doesn’t make sense to you. , Grab your spark generator and stick it into that hole that you drilled earlier. If the hole isn’t wide enough do some more drilling before you try to stick the spark plug in there. You don't want to damage the spark generator or the wire.

, If you're using a threaded pipe, still use the cement but you can also use pipe ribbon for extra sealant. You need to glue it so that it is airtight. This step can’t be skipped or your gun won’t fire.

, You want to the screw to be sitting in such a way so that it is 1⁄16 inch (0.2 cm) away from meeting the prong on the inside. Try to be as exact as you can. , The grill igniter is the piece of equipment with a red dot on top of it in your grill ignition kit. Grab the wire that hangs from the grill igniter and fasten it to this screw on the outside of the chamber. When you click the grill igniter, you should see a tiny spark jump across the prong to the screw. IF you don’t see a spark, check your connections. Don't let your body touch any of the metal parts, your body will take the shock and you won't get a spark. It helps to cover up all of the wiring with electrical tape.

, It should be a tight fit: ideally, the barrel should trim off the edges of the potato when you put it in.

, If you don't have any potatoes, you can load the gun with anything smaller than the bore. All you need to do is stuff a wet rag down the barrel before loading your ammo. This step is crucial, as it forms a tight seal and prevents pressure from escaping around the object. If desired, you can put another wet rag in after the ammo to keep it from falling out of the end of the barrel. , Never load a potato gun before you have identified a target and are sure that the firing of the potato gun will not result in bodily injury to anyone in front of or behind the intended target. , Spud guns are fun, but safety is paramount. Absolutely do not load the gun until you have a safe, intended target far away from anyone.

, Be prepared to do the next step in 10 seconds or less. If you don’t fire the gun quickly it won’t work. Don’t worry if it takes you a couple tries.

, Remember that after you do this you should hurry, because half of your time is already up. Screw the cap back on, but absolutely do not cross thread it. This means screwing it on without the threads connecting correctly. Prepare for a kick and push the button on the grill igniter.


Try to hold the end of the potato gun low so that it doesn’t kick back against your face accidentally.

, Congratulations, you've successfully and safely fired a potato gun. Clean your gun with a wet rag before you shoot the next potato from your cannon.

, The spark may not be traveling though all of the wires. Check all of the connections.

, Your body might have been touching something metal when you pulled the trigger, which would neutralize the electrical charge. Stand in an open field.

, If the potato gun didn’t work you probably waited too long to fire. This mistake is the most common. If you wait more that a few seconds after spraying the hairspray in the chamber, the fumes will condense, and you will be left with a sticky deodorant glob in the chamber. , You absolutely have to clean your gun after every shot. It won’t shoot twice in a row. There will be a puddle of hairspray in the chamber after you fire (only the fumes catch fire). You don't want the leftover glob of hairspray to stay in the chamber, or it will harden around the prong, and your gun will not make a spark. Also, clean it immediately after firing; otherwise the cap will get stuck. , You could have a weak seal around the projectile. Make sure it fits tightly in the barrel.

Spool of heavy string for stitching
Stretching blocks (small pieces of wood that will hold the leather in place)
Needle
Razor knife
Pronged punches (3 or 4 prongs work)
Leather cement (glue)
Hammer
Clamps (to stretch the leather)
Mold of your pistol (you can make this from wood or omit the mold and use your actual pistol)
Empty weapon;
, You’ll need quite a bit of leather to make your own shoulder holster. Make sure to buy enough, even if it doesn’t match—you can dye it when you’re done.

1’x1’ square
1 ½” strip up to 48”
2”x4” rectangle

, This project will take multiple days to accomplish. However, if you spread it out too long, your leather will be more difficult to work with. Try to keep to a time frame that’s less than a week to make your shoulder holster., 1’x1’ is a good starting size for this piece of leather if you’re working with a standard pistol. For a larger handgun, cut it to make sure you can wrap your weapon in it. You’ll be making the pocket that holds your weapon with this piece; this is the holster. Fold the leather in half over the top of your weapon. When you do so, the handle should stick out. This is how you would grab your weapon if you need it., Using scissors or a utility knife, cut triangles out of the top corners. Your triangles should be an inch tall for a pistol. For a larger gun, you can cut up to 3” off. You should easily be able to fold the leather over your weapon and have a spare inch. This will be plenty of material to work with because it will stretch., Take your leather and soak it thoroughly in water. This will take a few minutes. Eventually, it will become pliable. Once this happens, squeeze the excess water out of it.

The side of the leather than is less tough is the inside of your leather. This side will soak water in better than the rough face of the leather.

, Do this with the middle of the leather piece over the barrel and have it wrap under the trigger. Using stretching blocks, put pressure on the leather around the mold and stretch it out. You should have one block on each side of the leather and it should be as close to the mold as you can. This will help the leather stretch once you clamp the blocks into place.

You can use any clamps that you want, as long as they will hold the blocks in place tightly.

, With the clamps holding the blocks, and the mold wrapped in the leather, place it in the sun to dry. This will take a few hours., Making inserts in your holster will help stiffen it. This helps hold your weapon safely and securely., You’re going to need a right, left, and top insert. Simply trace the sides and top of your weapon with a marker onto the inside of your leather. Rough cut it to be the size of your weapon. Cut it with your razor knife.Place a piece of spare leather between the leather that you’re cutting and the table. This protects your table and your razor blade.
Cut it bigger rather than smaller. Cut along the outside of the line that you’ve traced. This way you can match them up and cut them down until they are perfect. It is possible to cut them down more and more, but if you start off by cutting too much off, you can’t add to it.

, After a few hours, go get your holster. It will still be damp, but when you take off the clamps, it should be starting to hold the shape of your mold. Dampen the outer piece of the holster once again. You want it about ¾ as damp as the original time that you dampened it. This means it will be wet, but won’t leave water on your hand when you touch it., Use the empty weapon instead of your mold this time. It will give the leather a better fit around it. Use your stretching blocks and re-clamp them over your holster with the mold and inserts inside. Place your holster back in the sun to dry., The longer you let it sit and dry, the better shape it will hold on its own. If you don’t let the leather set in the proper position, your weapon won’t fit correctly. This could cause it to fall out of the holster, or it could create difficulty for you when trying to get it out., When your leather dries, you should see that is has stretched tightly around your weapon. You’ll be able to see where the sights (the clip on the top of the gun) are by a noticeable bump in the leather on the top of your gun., Clamp your blocks with the holster and top insert between them to help the glue take.

Scuff the leather with a knife to help the glue hold a little bit better.

, This glue will dry quickly: 5-10 minutes is all it takes. When it is dry, remove the clamps. With your top insert glued in, wrap your leather around your weapon once again to check the fit., You’re going to stitch your insert to your holster with your needle and heavy string. Using the pronged punch will help to create the stitching holes will make it possible for you to get the needle through the leather. If you don’t use one, it will be too difficult to get the needle through.

A pronged punch looks like a fork. Simply place it with the prongs facing into the leather, lined up where you want to make indents. Hold it steady and hit the top of the punch with your hammer. The prongs will go into the leather, but not all the way through. Pull the punch out and continue doing this all the way around your insert.

, Go through your stitch holes with the needle and string until your top insert is permanently secure. Start wherever you’d like on your holster and go all the way around. Finish is the same stitch hole that you started in.

Knot your string onto your needle to make it easier for you.
This will take a lot of strength to get the needle through the leather. Keep using the guide-holes that you made with your pronged punch.
If you miss a hole, take the needle back through the way it came and fix it. Your leather will pull unevenly if you don’t.

, To finish your stitching, stitch through your original hole twice. This will help your stitch hold strongly for the life of your holster., Let the glue dry for 5-10 minutes again. Again, use the prong and your curved needle and string to stitch these inserts to your holster., When you fold your leather down, you’ll still have extra fabric on the bottom. With your weapon in the leather, fold it over and glue the leather in place. Don’t be afraid of getting the glue on your weapon—it will come off. Use your clamps one more time to help secure the glue., Once the glue dries, test out how your weapon will pull out of the holster. If it is a snug fit, you can sew this last part together. Once again, take your prong and make stitch indents around the shape of the bottom of your weapon.

If you make the stitch too close to where your weapon sits, you won’t be able to fit your weapon in your holster. If you need to, you can keep the weapon in the holster while you stitch the remaining side. #Clean you edge. After this stitching is done, use your knife to finish shaping your holster. Be sure to leave 1/8” of leather from your stitching so that your stitching doesn’t get loosened over the years.

, If you wish, you can buy leather dye and dye your holster. This is only for cosmetic purposes, and totally up to you., This should be 1 ½” wide and long enough to go around your shoulders and meet in the middle of your back. An easy way to measure this is to make a figure eight and putting your arms through it. This is usually going to be from 35”-48”. , This is going to sit on the center of your upper back. Sew the middle of the long strap to the bottom of the rectangle., Do the same with the left side of the strap. This is going to form your arm loops., If you’re a righty, use your leather cement to attach your holster to the left shoulder strap. Put the straps on and mark where you’d like to have the holster. Once it’s marked, take the straps off and use your cement to attach it. Use your clamps and let it sit for at least 10 minutes while the cement dries.

Attach your holster in a place that is concealed, comfortable, and in easy reach., The leather cement will hold your holster in place. However, if you wish to add extra support, you can use another strip of leather. Place a small strip of leather (no more than 3”) and lay it on your holster, over the strap. Stitch this strap onto both the holster and the strap.

It will take a lot of strength to attach this strap because you will be going through up multiple layers of leather. Be sure to use your prong punch and hammer to create insertion holes for the stitches.

Tape the tube in the middle, and at both ends of the tube.

, Take another 8½"" x 11"" piece of paper. Place the first tube at the end of the fresh sheet of paper and roll it up. Be sure the second tube is neither too tight, nor too loose. Tape the outer tube.









You can check on the fit by taping the outer tube and then attempting to slide the inner in and out of the outer tube. The inner tube should move easily, but not fall out of the outer tube.
Pull the inner tube out of the outer tube.

, With scissors, cut two parallel slits (approximately ½"" long and 1½"" apart) across the the inner tube. The slits should sit near the middle of the tube.









Cut out a rectangle by cutting from one slit to the other.

, Keeping the inner tube in place, slide the outer tube backwards 1½"". Comparing the two tubes, use a pencil to sketch out the approximate length of the inner tube's rectangle on the outer tube.









Cut the rectangle out of the outer tube. Fit the inner tube back into the outer tube. the two rectangle should align when you pull the inner tube out. This is where you will load your paper bullets.

, Take another sheet of 8½"" x 11"" paper. Roll it into a tube and secure the tube with tape. The circumference of this tube does not matter, but should approximately match the other tubes you've already rolled.









Cut this tube to the desired handle length. Cutting the tube in half is a good starting length, but you can choose how long or short to make it.
Tape the bottom of the handle.

, Tape the handle to the bottom of the outer tube. Use a couple pieces of tape to sure the handle to the body of the gun.









Before taping your handle, make sure the loading slots are positioned either on the top or side of the gun.
You can create a second handle to be placed under the barrel of the gun for support. Use the leftover tube cut from the handle and cut it to the desired length. Tape this secondary handle to the bottom of the barrel of the gun.

, Pull the inner tube forward out of the outer tube. On the back end of the outer tube, cut two ½"" slits, ½"" apart. Cut across the slits and remove the small rectangular piece of paper.









Push the inner tube back in through the outer tube and pull it out the back. Using a scrap from one of your cut tubes, roll a tight ½"" long tube. Wrap that tube in tape and affix that smaller tube, or loading knob, to the inner tube using thin pieces of tape. This knob should fit in the slits created on the outer tube.

, Cut out 3"" x 3"" square of paper and place them on your table so they look like diamonds. Roll the squares from the right-hand corner to the left-hand corner, making a cone. Tape the cone tightly.









You can cut the open end of the bullet down if you feel it is too long to fit in the chamber easily.

, Pull the loading knob back and place your bullet into the chamber. Push the loading knob back into place. Blow through the back of the gun. Bask in the glory of having made your very own (firing) paper gun!

Reload the launcher.",How to Make a Grenade Launcher1," Standard cylindrical water bottles work best for the ammunition. You want bottles made with thinner plastic that you can easily crush when they’re empty. However, don’t crush them.


Bottles in the twelve-ounce size are the most common and work very well for this purpose.;
, With the caps on, twist each empty bottle just below the label. You want to twist until you feel the pressure in the bottle bulge the upper half. It may take several twists.


You will have to keep a grip on both ends to keep the twisted portion from righting itself.
When the upper portion doesn’t squish but feels firm from the pressure, the bottle is ready.

, Use a wide strip of tape the holds firmly to go around the twisted part of the bottle and stop it from unwinding. Duct tape works well.

, If you simply want to shoot the cap like this without the launcher, loosen the cap until it starts to turn easily but without depressurizing the bottle. Then aim away from people, pets, and fragile items and use the palm of your hand to spin the cap quickly. The pressure in the bottle will carry the cap several yards.

, The two tubes you have should be the same size, roughly 16” to 24” long, and with a diameter that allows your water bottle ammo to slide easily down them with gravity alone.


Wide mailing tubes that people use for posters or blueprints work well, and you can easily find them at a post office or other mail supply store. Ensuring they are wide enough for the bottles is the most important part.

, With a pair of scissors, cut the first tube in a straight line from end to end. Uncurl it enough so that you can measure 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) in and make another cut parallel to the first.


The removed strip will be 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) wide and as long at the original tube.

, Fold the tube back into a cylinder and tape it well with duct tape so that the seam down the length of the tube can’t reopen. The finished product will look like the same tube, but it will have a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) smaller circumference than the original.


Test that this tube now fits snugly inside the second tube. It should slide in but without being able to easily fall out.
If, when you gather your tubes, you can find one that fits inside the larger barrel tube snugly, then you can skip this part, but most mailing tubes have too much size difference, and you just need to trim one.

, Using duct tape, close off the hole at one end of the smaller tube. You will essentially be using this end of the smaller tube as a ramrod to push the water bottles down the barrel of the larger tube, so make sure it’s sturdy tape.

, Take the larger tube and draw a rectangle just a bit larger than your chosen water bottles on one end. However, make the rectangle 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the actual end of the tube.


Since you’re leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) instead of cutting from the end of the tube, you’ll have to poke a hole into the drawn rectangle and cut it out from there.
In the finished product, this hole will be where the water bottle ammo falls into the barrel from a magazine.

, Hold the tube in front of you with the hole from the first rectangle pointing up. Rotate the tube 90 degrees clockwise (counter-clockwise if you’re left-handed) and draw a second rectangle (of the same size) at the opposite end of the tube. Make this rectangle 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the end as well, but only cut three of the four sides out.


Leave one of the long sides intact. This will create a flap at the end. In the finished product, this flap will act as the cartridge ejector for a bottle after you have launched the cap.

, Take a larger bottle such as a two-liter bottle and cut off the neck. From there, cut the spout off the bottle as well. Use your duct tape to secure the piece over the end of the larger tube at the same end as the cartridge ejector flap.


You basically want to make a funnel where the tapered end is large enough so that the mouth of a water bottle will fit through but not the entire bottle. The piece may have a slight dome shape like the lid of a Slurpee cup after you’ve made the cuts.
In the finished product, this piece will stop each water bottle from being able to fall out of the tube entirely while still leaving a big enough hole for the cap to emerge before being fired.

, Use scissors to cut the tops off both of the tissue boxes, but only cut the bottom out of one of them. Stack the box with both removed onto the one with just the top removed and tape them together. The finished product will look like one extra-deep tissue box.

, Just as you did with the flap on the larger tube, cut three sides of the bottom of the now-larger tissue box to create a flap. Leave one of the two longer sides intact.


This is where you will feed additional ammo into the magazine.

, Secure the fully removed opening (not the flap part) in the tissues boxes over the fully removed rectangle (again, not the flap one) of the larger tube. You can use either glue or more duct tape for this.

, With the water bottle ammo you made earlier, load the launcher magazine by opening the flap and putting one or more bottles inside with the caps all facing toward the funnel barrel tip.


Notice how only one round (bottle) actually falls through the hole into the tube.

, Use the sealed end of the smaller tube as a ramrod to push the round down the barrel. You want to push the smaller tube until it’s holding the round in place with the cap sticking out of the funnel barrel.


Don’t shove too hard since you will likely end up separating the funnel barrel from the larger tube where you attached it.

, Hold the launcher under one arm with that hand on the barrel, which leaves your other arm free to loosen and spin the cap to fire the round in the same steps mentioned in Part 1.

, By lifting the cartridge ejector flap you cut into the front side of the barrel, you can simply tilt the launcher slightly, and the spent cartridge will easily fall out.

, Pull the ramrod tube back from the end of the barrel tube just far enough to clear the magazine feed, and your next round in the magazine will fall into place. Push the ramrod tube forward again until the new round is set against the funnel barrel tip, and you are locked and loaded to shoot again.

Grab the handle of the top piece, then gently lift and push it to the side so the spring comes loose from the bottom piece. Be careful not to break the clothespin or bend the spring.The spring will still be loosely attached to the top piece. You can easily take the spring off now that the bottom piece is removed.;
, Rotate the clothespin pieces so the flat surfaces on the back are pressed together. The thicker ends should be together on one side, with the thinner ends making a point on the other side. Make sure the center notches in the wood that held the spring clasps are lined up so they form a small circular hole between the two pieces.

, Grab a pen or marker. You will want to draw the lines that will mark the areas you will need to chisel with your utility knife.You can label the wooden pieces on the inside edge of the wood to help keep them straight. Mark one piece with a T for the top piece and one with a B for the bottom piece to help keep them from getting confused.

, Take your pen or marker and make a small mark on the top piece of wood. You should draw it at the corner, where the top piece of wood meets the bottom piece.

, Starting from the pointed ends of the wood, look for the first indention along the bottom piece of the gun. It will be about an inch from the pointed ends along the lower edge of the wood. Draw a small 1 cm mark at the top back corner of the indented arc. The mark should be at a 45-degree angle, so it points toward the other line you previously drew on the top piece.

, Take apart the pieces so the inner portions are facing you. Make a line across the inside of the top piece, even with the first mark that you drew on the side. The line should be parallel to the center notch for the spring. Finally, shade the area between the line you drew and the notch for the spring. It should form a small square on the top piece.

, Draw a straight line on the inside of both pieces from the notch for the spring toward the pointed end of the clothespins. The lines should be centered on the clothespin. You may want to use a ruler to get the lines as straight as possible.

, Use the utility knife to chisel away the pieces where marked. Trim the center line on both pieces to make a barrel of the gun. Trim away the small square on the top piece to make the firing chamber. Then carve the small notch across the indent on the bottom piece to hold the front clasp of the spring trigger.

, Use a brush to apply the glue lightly on the surface, or put some glue on a flat surface and lightly touch the clothespin pieces to get a thin coating. You want a to cover the surface completely and thoroughly, but be sure you don't get glue into the notches that were cut away to make the chamber, barrel and trigger notch.


If you don't have any glue you can use a rubber band. Wrap the rubber band around the thick end of the clothespins to hold them together., Press the pieces together firmly. Wipe away any glue that seeps out the edges. Let pieces sit until the glue is completely dry.

, Take one end of the spring and fit it through the center hole in the clothes pin. Fit the other end into the notch that was whittled into the bottom of the gun. The spiral coil of the spring will stick out along the bottom of the gun and serve as the trigger.

, Put a matchstick or toothpick into the barrel of the gun. It should slide easily the channel that was carved. Keep going until you reach the metal spring.

, Using the toothpick or matchstick, push back the spring. Keep pushing the spring backward until the part of the spring in the center of the gun locks into place at the back of the chamber., Find your target, then pull back the spring by coiled portion. The force of the spring clasp popping forward will send your ammo flying.


Be careful not to injure anyone with your powerful weapon. No one wants a toothpick in the eye!

Check the forks if you accidentally clip the base with your ammo.",How to Use a Slingshot," Round, dense objects will work best. Marbles or ball bearings are ideal. Avoid using stones. The object should be round so it shoots straight.








Marbles are among the cheapest ammo choice, and the bright colors will make it easier to track your shot.;
, Hold the base with your dominate hand. With the opposite hand, place the ammo in the center of the pouch. Do not let the ammo shift away from the center of the band.








, Use your thumb and index finger to keep the ammo in place. Your thumb should be parallel with the strap. You can curl your index finger slightly and press the other side of the pocket between your first and second knuckles.









Avoid squeezing the pocket closed around the ammo. There should be enough space for the shot to release cleanly.

, Usually, you will want to grip the slingshot handle with your dominant arm and use your other arm to pull back the ammo. When you shoot, your arm may allow the slingshot to jerk forward slightly. This can throw off your accuracy. Your stronger arm will be more adept at keeping the slingshot steady when you release the shot.








, Raise your arm to the side and hold up the slingshot. Some shooters prefer to hold the slingshot so that the forks are pointed upward, and some like to angle the forks slightly to the side. Either position works, and both can be useful depending on the shot your are taking.









Not all slingshots are the same. Some have longer forks, or and some forks will be wider or narrower than others. You may have to adjust your grip based on the form of your slingshot as well.

, The shoulder of the arm that will hold the grip of the slingshot should face your target. Raise the slingshot so it is perpendicular to your body, and slightly angled away from your body. This positioning will provide ample room for you to use your other arm and draw the slingshot band all the way back.








, Keep your feet facing forward and even with the width of your shoulders.Keeping your feet too close together will make it harder to keep perfect balance and aim your shot accurately.








, Take your time. Aim slightly above your target. You can angle your head slightly toward the slingshot to check your aim, but be sure to keep your head clear of the ammo.









Try to use both eyes. Many shooters tend to rely on their dominant eye when aiming and close the other. While visual restrictions make this necessary, you will find you perform better when you practice using both eyes to find your target., Pull until the band is completely stretched out. Make sure you see all of the triangle formed by the forks of the slingshot.








, Breathing is a big part of making accurate shots. Draw a breath into your lungs, release the breath completely, then take the shot. This will eliminate any chance that your slight body movements caused by breathing could mess up your shot. Take your shot during the body's NRP, or natural respiratory pause.







, Make one last check to make sure there is nothing that you might accidentally hit with your shot. Then let go of the ammo and watch it fly.









Try to flick your wrist forward slightly after letting go of the ammo for a better shot.
Make sure your thumb is not in the way of the projectile as it leaves the sling. This can be very painful!

, You can adjust the bands by creating more or less length in the bands. You will likely need to loosen the band from the attachment. Slide the band to create the right length, then tighten the bands again.









If the band is at full length and the ammo is still not going far enough, consider trying a band made from a different material. Flat bands usually generate more power, but they can wear out much faster than the common nylon tube material., If the band breaks, you can usually contact the manufacturer to get a replacement. Be sure to check how easy it is to replace and adjust the bands when you select your slingshot.









There are many different ways to attach the band to the base and some are easier and more secure than others. Ideally, you should select an attachment made of rubber or even string, as there is minimal risk of injury if the attachment breaks loose., Make sure there are not any cracks in the material that could affect the performance of the slingshot. You don't want to have the piece suddenly snap off when you go to pull the band back. It can cause serious injury.









If you have damaged the base significantly you will likely need to replace it.

Take your plastic water bottle and cut of the top, slanted part of the bottle.,
Take your Bic pen and take the cap and the tip of the pen and rip it off.

,
Next take the bottom and bite it off.,
Take the tissue and fold it until it is long and skinny and wrap it on top of one side of the pen.

,
Next cover it in duct tape.

,
Then stick the part of the pen that is covered in duck tape into the slanted part of the water bottle.

,
Now, wrap the tip of the water bottle with duck tape (this is used to secure it so it doesn't fall out).

,
Stick the spitball into the pen and blow out the bottle.

Gather materials.,
Superglue the spring to the inside of the PVC end cap.,
Superglue a plastic disc to the other end of the spring.,
Drill two holes in the PVC tube.,
Use the PVC glue to glue the end cap onto the tube.,
Attach the launcher to your favorite Nerf gun with velcro.,
Prime the launcher.,
Load the launcher.,
Fire the launcher.",How to Make a Grenade Launcher2," This design calls for a one-foot section of two-inch diameter PVC tubing, an end cap for the two-inch PVC, PVC glue, superglue, velcro, a spring, plastic discs, a paint can opener, a drill, a ruler, and plenty of ammunition.

, The best springs for this design are long, medium coil tension springs such as those found on the inside of the “snakes” in practical joke canisters that spring out when opened. Superglue this spring directly to the center of the PVC end cap., You can easily cut this plastic disc out of something household such as an empty laundry detergent bottle. Most importantly, cut the disc with a 1.5” diameter so that it can easily fit flat down the PVC tube. Center this disc on the opposite end of the spring and attach it with more superglue.

, You want to test how deep you can coil the spring into the tube before drilling the first hole, so fit the end cap onto the tube without gluing it and push the plastic disc all the way down with a ruler. Use that to gauge how far the spring coils down the tube, and drill the first hole in the tube one-half inch more shallow than the depressed disc. Drill the second hole at the opposite end of the tube about one inch from the end.


each hole perforate both sides of the tube in a perfectly straight line.Use a drill bit large enough so that you can insert the paint can opener through the holes., Once you have your holes drilled, you can glue the end cap holding the spring into place on the tube.You’ll want to give the glue thirty minutes to dry before testing the launcher.

, To make this launcher resemble an M203 grenade launcher, you can attach it under the barrel of a carbine-style Nerf or Airsoft gun with velcro. Simply peel the plastic backing off a velcro strip and place one end on the tube and the other on the gun.


You can use the wall-safe velcro types, which will even allow you to remove the velcro easily when you want.
For select Nerf models such as the Recon, you can use the sight that attaches to the gun and slides off instead. Attach this piece to the tube, and you can clip the launcher to the gun where that slides and locks into place.You can just as easily use this design without it being attached to anything else as well.

, Push the spring all the way down, then insert the painter can opener key into the hole drilled into the bottom of the tube. This will hold the spring coiled while you load the launcher.

, This design can hold a ton of Nerf darts. Insert the darts in sets of five or six to keep them straight as they drop down the tube. You can place about three of these layers to fill the tube. Once you have loaded the tube, place a second plastic disc with the same diameter as the first one you cut into the tube on top of the ammo load. Hold this disc down while you remove the paint can opener from the bottom set of holes and insert it back into the top set of holes in the top of the barrel.


If you still have some of the old Nerf ball-type ammunition, these fit in the tube and fire effectively as well.

, Now you simply have to aim the launcher and pull the paint can opener back out as though it were a firing pin. The high load of ammunition may not explode on impact (obviously), but the spread of the ammunition gives you a much more effective idea of a blast radius.


Just like an M203, the angle of the launcher is how you aim.Practice firing it several times to get a feel for the trajectory of the launch, and then you will be able to aim proficiently in no time.

There are many ways to use a sling.",How to Make a Sling," This could be thin nylon rope or jute of some kind. You will need about two and a half to three feet depending on the length of your arm. Cut this in half but leave one end a couple of inches longer than the other.;
, The pouch is the main part of the sling. It holds the ammo. The best material I have found is leather, but canvas or heavy cloth would work. It has to be very strong, else the cords will tear through it.

,,,, Again, the bowline knot works very well. This is the retention cord.

, This is the release cord.

, You need to pinch it, not grip it .Pinch using the end of your thumb and the side of your index finger, first joint from the knuckle.

, It should be about the size of a golf ball or egg.

, One of the simplest is called the Apache Throw. Face 60 degrees away from your target, your arm extended behind your back, with your weight on your back foot. Swing forward, bringing your arm forward like a line drive. As you do this, shift your weight to your front foot and swing the rest of your body forward. Your arm guides the throw, but it is your body that propels the stone to lethal velocity. To release the stone, simply let go of the release cord.

Choose a suitable tube.,
Cut a 6"" length of this tube.,
Choose a balloon that's a tight fit on the tube without having to cut the neck from it and slowly work it onto the cardboard tube, gripping it with your fingers and going around the tube to slide it on evenly.,
Projectile: To load the sling-shot drop a BB or small stone into the tube and into the balloon.,
Hold the cardboard tube with one hand.",How to Make a Tape Roll BB Shooter," Try to find rigid cardboard tubing such as the tube from a wide roll of aluminum foil, which is thicker than most cardboard tubes but has a smaller diameter. You can also use a toilet roll tube, which is flimsy in comparison and a lot wider. A narrow tube will give better accuracy than a wider tube.;
, A craft knife will also give a nice clean cut.

, It takes time and patience but pays dividends if done this way. You need to slide the balloon neck over the tube till only the ""bulb"" portion is at the end of the tube; then, roll the excess back on the tube; at some point it will stop because it will be extremely tight on the tube and secured.


Roll on all the neck of the balloon onto the tube. If there is any amount of the neck not rolled onto the tube it will constrict under tension and cause a block; the projectile will simply 'spit' out because it hits the constriction on the way out. Ensure only the 'bulb' of the balloon is at the end of the tube.

,


BBs are ball bearings, and those sold as BB 'ammunition' are, in fact, slight rejects that fall outside stringent tolerances; often failing by a few millionths of an inch. Precision ball bearings are expensive and unnecessary for ammunition.
BBs are much more accurate because of their even surface and will project further than uneven chippings or loose stones. Small stones, because of their sharp edges, are likely to rupture the balloon sooner. Although the cost is minimal, it can take a long time to replace.

, With the other hand, use your finger and thumb to grip the projectile through the balloon and then pull back to your desired tension. Start off short and work up to greater tension as you become more confident and have some control of its trajectory and begin to achieve better accuracy. Release, and the balloon will snap back to shape and the BB/projectile will shoot out through the tube.

Purchase a water bottle.,
Pierce a small hole in the bottle cap.,
Squeeze the water bottle.",How to Make a Water Gun with a Water Bottle1," A basic plastic bottle of water you purchase from the store works well. Any brand will do, and the size of the bottle doesn’t particularly matter. Make sure the water bottle is easy to carry and can hold enough liquid to last a water fight! Water bottles come in a variety of shapes and sizes., Use a small drill or nail to create a small hole in the cap of the bottle. This is where the water will be shot from. The size of the hole will determine the size of the stream, and thus, how quickly water is expended.


An awl and small hammer may also be used to easily create a hole in the bottle cap.Water bottles that have a “squeeze” top can be used as a water gun right off the bat! Just pull the top open and squeeze the bottle to launch a stream of water.

, Squeeze the body of the water bottle to produce a stream of water. This method only works using the air within the bottle and the remaining liquid. It’s fairly limited in terms of stream and volume, but can do in a pinch.

"
"
Purchase your materials.,
Pierce a hole in the bottle cap.,
Insert the bike pump.,
Create a hole elsewhere on the bottle.,
Pump the bike pump.",How to Make a Water Gun with a Water Bottle2," A pressurized water gun goes through water quickly, and using a large water bottle helps alleviate this issue. Choose a bottle that has a resealable cap so that you can refill the bottle when it has run out of water.


Other materials you'll need include a hand-held bike pump, a small drill or tack, and tape.
Bear in mind that you’ll be carrying the bottle while you use it as a water gun. A two liter bottle full of liquid can be somewhat heavy, roughly weighing 4 pounds., You will be inserting a bike pump needle into the opening you make, so make sure the hole is large enough. It may be roughly the same size, or a bit smaller, to fit the needle correctly.


A tight or snug fit for the needle is ideal, as this keeps the water gun from “falling apart” easily during use.
Using an hand drill or awl makes creating the hole easier, but be careful not to make the hole too large., Place the needle of the bike pump into the hole you created. You may use a bit of force if the hole is slightly smaller than the needle. This will help create a snug fit.


Apply some tape around the hilt of the needle, where it meets the bottle. This can help adhere the needle and pump to the bottle.
Use a hand pump for making this squirt gun. Hand pumps are easier to carry around than other types of pumps, and better facilitate actual water gun play., This is where the water will spray from. A small hole works well, as the water will be fired through pressure created by the bike pump. Choose a spot that allows you to easily aim the bottle while pumping.Puncturing multiple holes close to one another will create a wider “spray” effect. However, this will limit the distance the water gun fires, as the pressure will be divided between both holes.
A large hole will create a large stream of water, but will more quickly consume the water, and requires greater pressure to travel further.

, Holding the pump and bottle in position, start pumping the bike pump. As air is pumped into the bottle, pressure will build, forcing water out of the only opening available – the hole you created earlier.


Make sure the bottle is able to let out enough water to handle the pressure. You may have to adjust the size of the firing hole to get a smooth stream.
If the bottle feels like it is “inflating” and no water is coming out of the bottle, stop pumping and adjust the hole. You don’t want to risk any explosive events, such as the bike pump needle launching from the bottle.Fill the bottle full of ice to give your victims a chilling blast of ice cold water.

Purchase your materials.,
Build the nozzle.,
Create the bottle adapter.,
Vent the bottle adapter.,
Build the nozzle assembly.,
Build the fill assembly.,
Attach the bottle adapter to the bottle.,
Attach the water gun to a hose.,
Release the nozzle ball valve.",How to Make a Water Gun with a Water Bottle3," Creating a PVC water gun requires a few common piping parts. These can be found at most hardware stores, such as Home Depot or Lowes. You will want a few hardware tools as well, which may also be found at the same stores.


You will want the following materials: a 6 inch piece of 1/2"" PVC, a 3 inch piece of ½” PVC, a tee with a threaded side outlet, two 4 inch PVC nipples, one 2 inch PVC nipple, a threaded PVC cap, two threaded ball valves, a garden hose adapter (hose to ½” female thread), a ½” male adapter (female slip to male threaded), and a 2 liter water bottle.
Think of the water gun as being made of three parts: the bottle adapter, the fill assembly, and the nozzle assembly.

, Drill a small hole into a PVC cap. The size of the hole you create will determine the size of the water stream that is created. The smaller the hole, the smaller the stream.


Check online for resources related to working with PVC pipe. There are many guides available for identifying, connecting, and modifying piping.Note that a larger water stream means you’ll have to fill up the bottle more often!

, The bottle adapter connects the water bottle to the gun mechanism. Heat the middle of the 6 inch ½” PVC pipe with a heat gun. When the plastic is softened, press the opposite openings of the pipe toward one another (like pushing an accordion closed). This will flare out the pipe, creating a small bulge in the center. Place this pipe into the bottle so that the bulge snugly fits in the bottle opening, and allow to cool.


Make sure to heat just the middle portion of the PVC pipe. Leave the ends of the pipe cool so that you can use your hands to compress the pipe.
If the tube does not fit snug enough, remove the tube, reheat, and compress once again., Remove the adapter from the bottle and mark where the rim of the bottle meets the pipe, as well as where the pipe is first fully inside the bottle. Drill 2 or 3 small holes around the second line (the line where the pipe is first fully inside the bottle.) These holes allow the water to more effectively drain into the piping.


As a softer material, wood and metal drill bits both work well on PVC pipe.On many bottles, about 1 and ¼” inches from the bottom of the pipe are where the pipe first becomes fully enclosed in the bottle.

, The nozzle assembly is the piping that connects the nozzle to the ""trigger"" of the gun. Attach the nozzle to a 4 inch nipple. Connect the nipple to a threaded ball valve. Afterwards, connect the other side of the threaded ball valve into another 4 inch nipple, and plug the entire assembly into the tee. Use Teflon tape to assemble these pieces., The fill assembly is where the hose connects to the gun in order to fill the gun with water. Connect a 3 inch PVC pipe to the female slip to male threaded adapter. Connect a 2 inch nipple to the ½” female threaded to garden hose adapter. You should now have two “parts.” Connect these two parts using a second ball threaded ball valve. The threaded joints can be connected with Teflon tape, but PVC primer and cement are needed to attach the PVC pipe to the tee and adapter., Place the bottle adapter created earlier into the remaining open tee and cement it in place. Adhere a little cement to the inside of the 2 liter bottle, and place it on top of the bottle attachment. Allow several hours for all of the cement pieces to set.


Don’t cement the bottle in place until you are sure the bottle fits snugly onto the attachment., Screw a hose into the bottom of the gun and turn on the water. Make sure the bottom ball valve is open to allow water into the bottle.Once enough water has entered the bottle, close the bottom ball valve and remove the hose from the water gun. You will now have a “loaded” water gun.

, To fire the water gun, open the valve that is connected to the nozzle of the gun. The internal pressure of the bottle and piping will force water through the nozzle hole, produce a stream of water! Close the nozzle valve to cease firing.


Keep a hose nearby for whenever you need to fill the gun back up."

Remove the shell.",How to Make a Zip Gun," Conceivably, a zip gun can be constructed from household materials, but chances are you won't have everything you need. What's more, on top of the listed parts, you'll also need tools to properly file and drill the metal and wood pieces. These materials can be found at a hardware store, though there may be thing lying around your garage that will do the trick just as well.A receiver. A receiver is essentially the steel tube chassis for your zip gun. This is where all of the other parts will be made to fit in and where the bullets will rest. Ideally, it should be a 1/4' diameter tube to accommodate the most common types of ammo. Something along these lines can be found at a hardware store; improvised home gun makers have found success with gas and water pipe fitting.A 6 inch length for your pipe should suffice, although you may find it better to start with a longer length and saw it down to your preference.
A wood board, 8'x5'x1'. This will comprise your gun stock.
A 1/4' solid pipe plug and two steel pipe coupling, for the firing mechanism.
Two elastic bands and a ~5 inch metal strap.
Two #8 type screws and a flat head nail with a 1/16' diameter.;
, If a pipe is dented or a coupling broken, the zip gun you make could prove very dangerous.

, Drilling holes into metal will take precision and a high-quality drill. Drill a 9/16' diameter hole 3/8' deep into one of your couplings. From there, drill a hole 3/4' deep into the main pipe. Make the hole as big as you want to accommodate your chosen ammunitions; making it 25/64' (1 cm) in diameter will be enough to fit 9mm ammo. From there, fit the drilled coupling onto the pipe at the rear.If you have ammo at hand, you can use a bullet's size to gauge how big you need to make the hole.

, The pipe plug you should have acquired earlier should fit snugly inside your pipe. It will secure the bullets in the loading chamber. First, drill a hole in the center of the plug, just big enough to fit a nail through it. Stick the nail through and file it off at the other side. You'll be able to fit this plug in with the rear coupling when your zip gun is loaded., A stock is important for any gun, as it'll give the gun far more stability in your hands and it'll give you something to build the firing mechanism on. With the wood you have, saw pieces to fit around your pipe, leaving space at the front for a pipe couple. Also make sure to saw off an extra board to glue on an the bottom so you'll have something to hold onto it with. Take care to leave an opening at the back for the pipe plug and rear coupling. Furnished properly, the gun should look boxlike, with the receiving pipe protruding at the end.
Carpenter's glue is a good idea in this case to piece the wood together. You should give a few hours to let the stock set sufficiently.

, Once your stock has set to your liking, screw on the front coupling at the front of the zip gun. Following that, attach the rear coupling at the back of the pipe, and screw in the pipe plug., A makeshift firing mechanism can be tricky, but an elastic slingshot effect does the trick in the case of a zip gun. Take a strap of metal and bend it into a 'U' shape, drilling holes at the end to connect it with the rest of the gun. File a small notch on either side of the metal strap to fit elastic bands. Attach it to your wooden stock by putting two screws through the holes in the strip and securing them to the top of the stock. From there, attach an elastic band to each side of your strap and stretch them to the front coupling., If you have any intent on feeding your zip gun with live ammunition, you need to make absolutely sure that the gun has been constructed perfectly. This includes giving it a thorough look over to make sure there are no cracks in the material or flaws that occurred before or during the device's making., Loading a zip gun is fairly simple. Just remove the plug at the rear coupling, add the bullet firmly inside, and close it up again. Repeat this easy step whenever it comes time to shoot off another projectile.An improvised weapon can accommodate it own, invented brand of ammunition. However, this zip gun has been designed to work with 9mm ammunition, so chosen because it is a small calibre, cheap, and relatively easy to come across.

, Due to the fact the firearm has been made at home, there is absolutely no assurance it will work safely. To save yourself the risk of injury, you should try activating the gun from afar. Go to an open space and attach a cord to the metal strap firing mechanism. Secure the gun in place so that you can control the firing direction. Find somewhere at least 3 meters away behind cover to activate it. Pull the cord and let the gun fire.


If the loaded projectile fired successfully, you'll know you assembled the zip gun correctly.
If for whatever reason the zip gun exploded, you'll have saved yourself a life-debilitating injury.

, You can fire your zip gun by pulling the metal strap back and releasing. Pull back the strap carefully and hold it with your thumb until you're ready to let it loose. Releasing the pressure will cause the gun to fire; make sure not to flinch when it goes off or you might send the bullet flying astray.Improvised firearms aren't made for range nor accuracy, so don't get your hopes up for hitting targets or whatever else. Zip guns are most effective at point blank range.

, Once a shot has been fired, you need to remove the empty shell from the gun's chassis. Remove the shell by taking out the plug from the rear coupling and pushing it out with a thin rod.

Have your supplies for making your toy gun on hand.,
Cut the barrel of your toy gun.The barrel of your toy gun will begin as a 6x6 inch (15x15 cm) flat piece of cardboard.,
Form the rectangular barrel from your cardboard square.You can do this by folding your cardboard at equal intervals.,
Tape your barrel along the open edge.,
Create plugs for the open ends of your barrel.,
Tape your handle into a rectangular tube.,
Cut both ends of your handle at the same angle.,
Cut a plug for the bottom of your handle.,
Attach your handle and barrel together.,
Add a trigger to your gun.,
Add personal touches to your toy gun.,
Paint your gun.",How to Make a Toy Gun1," To make a cardboard toy gun, you'll want to find cardboard that is fairly rigid, like the cardboard from a shoe box or a cereal box.Cardboard that is thin and flimsy will make a gun that is not very sturdy. Including your cardboard, you'll also need:


Cardboard
Tape
Glue (optional)
Scissors
Paint
Ruler
Pencil;
, Mark out these measurements on your cardboard to guide your cutting, then use your scissors to cut your square of cardboard free.


Be sure your cardboard is not so stiff that you cannot fold it. You will need to fold this piece of cardboard several times to mold it into the shape of your barrel.
You might also use the semi-rigid, cardboard back of a notebook, if you have no shoe or cereal boxes available.

, For example, you might fold your cardboard straight across every 1.5 inches (4 cm) until you can go no farther. Then unfold your cardboard and bend the opposite ends so as to touch, creating a square shape. For a thinner barrel,


Make the interval at which you fold smaller. For example, you might fold every ¾"" until you can't fold anymore.
Then unfold your cardboard and bend it into a rectangular tube, allowing excess to overlap on the outside.

, Use as much tape as you need to secure the open edge of your cardboard barrel. In the event you have some overlap with your cardboard, you might strengthen your barrel by:


Putting a dab of glue where the overlapping parts of your cardboard meet. Hold the cardboard together tightly for about three to five minutes while the glue sets.

, Hold your rectangular barrel at a 90° to your cardboard and use your pencil to trace its outline. Then, using your scissors, cut these free and attach both to the open ends of your barrel.


Use as much tape as you need to attach your plugs to the open ends of your barrel.
Cut the handle of your toy gun. Your handle will be made in a similar fashion to your barrel, with an angled cut at the top of the handle imitating the connecting point between barrel and handle.
Use your pencil to outline a 6x3 inches (15x7.5cm) piece of cardboard.
Cut your outline free with your scissors.

, This tube will be similar to the one you made for you barrel, but smaller. Fold your cardboard at regular intervals, then unfold it and tape the open edge to create a sturdy rectangular tube.


For example, you might fold your handle a ½"" at a time until you can fold no more, then touch the opposite ends together to form a square shape.
Use as much tape as necessary to secure your handle.
If you have some overlapping cardboard, you can strengthen your handle with a dab of glue where the cardboard overlaps.
If you use glue, hold the glued cardboard firmly with your fingers for two to five minutes until the glue sets.
A narrower handle can be made by folding a ¼"" at a time until you can fold no more. Then fold your cardboard into a square shape, allowing excess cardboard to overlap on the outside, and fasten the loose edge with tape and/or glue.

, The angled top and bottom of your handle will make your toy gun look more realistic. To make sure your angle is the same on both ends, you might want to:


Mark one side of the top of your handle ½"" below its top edge.
Mark the opposite diagonal side (the opposite side of the bottom) ½"" above its bottom edge.
Use your ruler to draw a straight line from your mark to the opposite corner of the same side of the handle, for both top and bottom.
Cut along the line formed between each mark and its same side corner.

, Hold your toy gun handle to your cardboard to form a 90° angle so that it roughly forms an L shape with your cardboard. Then use your pencil to trace the outline of your handle.


Use your scissors to cut the cardboard plug for the bottom of your handle free from your cardboard.
Use as much tape as you need to attach your plug to the bottom of your handle.

, Glue and/or tape the handle of your toy gun to the barrel at the end opposite the front of your barrel. Be sure you hold glued cardboard firmly together for two to five minutes to allow the glue to set, if applicable. You may want to first glue your handle to the barrel, then after the glue has dried, strengthen the connection with tape.


The angle of your handle should be attached to your barrel so that its incline is facing the front of the barrel of your gun.

, A simple trigger can be made by cutting a thin L shape out of your cardboard with your scissors. Then you should cut a slit into the underside of the barrel of the gun, slightly in front of the handle. Slide the long part of your L piece into the slit until you reach the bend in the L. Then glue or tape your trigger into place.

, To make a hammer on the top, back-end of your barrel, you can cut another thin L shape out of your cardboard, similar to your trigger but smaller than it, and cut a slit in the top, back-end of your barrel. Insert the long end of your L until you reach the bend, keeping the part sticking out facing backwards, and glue it into place. You might also:


Add thin strips along both sides of the barrel of your gun to give it contour and character.
Make a raised sight along the top of the barrel by layering several thin strips of cardboard there.
Create a trigger guard by cutting a thin strip of cardboard and connecting that strip from the handle below the trigger to the underside of the barrel in front of the trigger.

, You may want to make a realistic gun by painting the entire thing black. Or maybe your toy gun is really a space-age shooter, in which case gray and red accents might be a better choice.


Acrylic paint works well, but many other kinds of paint should work as well.
You might also wrap black electrical tape around parts of the gun, like the handle.

Gather the parts needed for your toy gun.,
Remove the screws from your old glue gun.But before you do, you should check to make sure it isn’t plugged in and is cool to the touch.,
Remove the insides of the glue gun.,
Put the casing back together and test the trigger.,
Add personal touches to your toy gun.,
Create a realistic sound effect with bang snaps.",How to Make a Toy Gun2," Your first challenge is to find a broken glue gun. You might ask your parents or an art teacher if there is a broken model that you can use as the frame for a toy you are making, but be sure you ask to use it first. To make this toy gun, you'll need:


Glue gun
Screwdriver
Party snaps (optional)
Paint (optional)
Black electrical tape (optional)
Glue (optional)

, Once you know it is safe to take apart, use your screwdriver to take out the screws from the casing.


If you have a battery powered hot glue gun, you should remove the batteries before attempting to unscrew it.

, Now that the screws are out, you shouldn't have much difficulty pulling the two plastic halves of the case apart, though you might meet with some resistance. If you have difficulty taking the casing apart, twist the casing slightly to pop it free. Then:


Identify the trigger and loading mechanisms, which should be connected. The trigger, when pulled, will cause the loading mechanism to push glue sticks through the casing.Remove all the internal components except the trigger and loading mechanisms.
Take off the metal nozzle at the front of the gun., Use your screwdriver to reinsert the screws into your casing and fasten it together again. Then, test the trigger by pressing down on it with your finger. You should be able to feel some resistance, which means that the trigger is still moving the loading device in the casing.


If the trigger is loose and feels like it isn't engaging the loading mechanism, you'll need to make adjustments.
Open the casing and check the connection between the trigger and loading mechanism. Repair any breaks between the two with tape.
If it appears that the trigger and loading mechanism have been separated, you may have to reconnect the two with tape.

, You can give your toy gun a sight by gluing a bead on top of the front end of the barrel. You should also consider painting your gun a more authentic color, like black or gray, but feel free to use your imagination.


There may be a gun in your favorite TV show or video game that you'd like to imitate. Use your paint to decorate your gun until you are satisfied with its appearance.

, A bang snap is a kind of novelty firework that, when thrown or stepped on produces a loud noise similar to the caps used in a cap gun. Create your sound effect by triggering the bang snap with the loading mechanism by:


Placing a party snap inside the loading area.
Pulling the trigger to engage the loading mechanism.

Assemble the gun.",How to Make a Water Gun1," To make a water gun out of PVC, you need to go to your local hardware or home improvement store. You need to buy a 20"" long, 3/4"" around PVC pipe, a 25"" rounded wooded stick that can fit into the PVC pipe, a 3/4"" PVC pipe cap, 1 screw, and a pack of toilet tank bold washers. You will also need a pair of scissors, glue that works on PVC, and a drill.


If you want to paint your gun, you may also want to buy some waterproof paint that will adhere to PVC pipe. Try outdoor spray paint or a can of deck paint.;
, Cut off a small piece of your PVC pipe with a saw and lay it over one of the plastic toilet tank washers. Using a pencil or marker, trace along the inner edge of the PVC pipe onto the plastic washer. Cut out around the mark on the washer with a pair of scissors.Make sure you cut along the outer edge of your mark. You don't want the washer to be too small because then your gun will leak. Measure it against the edge of the stick. It should be slightly larger than the circumference of the stick and hang over the edge a little bit.

, Grab one of the metal toilet tank washers from the pack. Holding the end of the stick, place the plastic washer directly against the flat end of the stick. Then put the metal washer on top of that, aligning the holes. Next, take the screw and place it in the holes. Using the drill, drill the screw and the washers to the end of the stick.


You want to be sure that the washers are centered in the middle of the stick's edge. You don't want the plastic washer to hang over unevenly along the edges.If both edges of the stick are rounded, you will need to cut an even, flat edge onto one side before you attach the washers with the screw.

, The PVC cap is going to control the kind of stream that comes out of your water gun. Depending on what kind of stream you want, you need to drill holes in the top of the PVC cap. You can change the width of your drill bit to push out more or less water, so make sure it is big enough to create a steady stream but small enough not to pour too much water out at once.If you want to try a more elaborate cap design, try making three or four holes around the center area of the PVC cap. It will pour streams from multiple holes and look super cool when shot. Just make sure the drill bit is a little smaller so you don't lose too much water all at once., Take the PVC cap and glue it to one end of the PVC pipe. Next, insert the stick into the other end of the PVC pipe. You should feel a little resistance as the washer pushes against the sides of the pipe. Now that it is together, stick the top with the cap on it into water and slowly pull out the stick. That will pull water into your pipe. Once you have enough water, pull it out. You are now ready for a water fight.


If you want to paint your gun, do that before you insert the stick into the pipe. Paint each part with the spray paint and let them dry. Then you can assemble the rest of the gun."

, In order to make your toothpick gun, you’ll need 5 items. If you don’t have them at home, you can find them at any hardware store.


Clothespin
Steel hand saw or X-acto knife
Wire cutters
Rubber band
Toothpicks

, Before you start to assemble your gun, you need to break the clothespin into two separate pieces. Rip the two pieces apart and untwist the metal spring. Remove the spring and set it aside. You should have two even pieces of wood.







, Take one side of your clothespin and hold it with the skinny end in your right hand. The indent closest to your right hand is the guideline you’ll use to make your cut. Place this indent in the mouth of your wire cutters. Squeeze until it breaks off.









You may have to move your clothespin piece up and down to give the wire cutters some leverage to break it.
Remember to wear your safety goggles!

, Once again, take the piece of wood with the skinny part in your right hand. The indent closest to you is the one you’ll saw. Take your steel hand saw and saw half way through from the indented side of your clothespin.









This will create an indent that will eventually hold your spring.

, Take the side of the clothespin that you used your saw on and hold it with the flat side facing up. Now, take the wider side of the piece that you cut and place its flat side up against this so that it sits flush. Wrap your elastic around the first indent from the wide end.








This elastic needs to be securely holding the two pieces together. If you leave it to loose, it won’t hold.

, Use the spring that you took off of your clothespin before you began. Slide one of the open ends into the crease you made with the saw. The other open end will wrap around this piece of wood and give it a secure hold. It will rest on right in front of your cut piece of wood.








The coil of the spring will be on the bottom of your sawed piece.

, Hold on firmly to your spring and slide the smaller piece of the clothespin over it until the first indent envelopes the spring. If you’re elastic is too tight, unwrap it once. If it is too lose and doesn’t hold onto the spring, wrap it one more time.








Once you have this part securely in your indent, slide the wooden piece back to its original position. The two ends of the wood pieces should meet up and your spring will still be in your indent. Your gun is now fully constructed.

, Hold your gun with the spring on the bottom. This is your trigger. Slide a toothpick in between the two pieces of wood. Slide it back so that it reaches the indent holding your spring.

, Use two fingers to hold your gun behind the elastic. Place another finger on the trigger (the coil of the spring). Pull back the trigger and watch your toothpick fly.








, Apples make great targets and are easily shot into with your toothpick gun. Set up some apples at different distances and try shooting them. Do not shoot the toothpicks at other people. Remember to wear your safety goggles."

Gather your materials.,
Make the base.,
Measure the piping.,
Glue down the top.",How to Make a Water Gun2," For this project, you only need a few items. You will need a spray bottle, an old pill bottle, glue, a sharp knife, and a pair of scissors. The spray bottle should have the plastic piping on the inside of the bottle. These are found on many household cleaners or you can buy a fresh one from the dollar store., Take the old pill bottle and remove the label. Then, take the cap and poke a hole in its center using your sharp knife. The cap might already have an indent in the middle of the cap. If it does, just puncture the cap using this as a guide. If not, find the center of the cap and puncture it with your knife. Once the hole is made, try to stick the plastic piping from the spray bottle inside the hole. If the hole is too small, use the knife or a ball point pen to try to open the hole a little wider until the piping can fit through it.


Make sure you don't make the hole too big. The plastic piping should be snug against the sides of the hole in the cap.

, Put the cap back on the pill bottle. Remove the piping from the top of the spray bottle and stick it into the cap. There will likely be an excess of pipe above the pill cap. Using the scissors, cut off the piping about 3/4 an inch above the cap. You want to make sure that there is enough left so you can stick it back into the bottom of the spray bottle.


If there is still too much, snip off the excess until the bottom of the spray nozzle fits snugly against the bottle cap and the pipe is completely inside the hole in the spray nozzle., Remove the bottle cap from the bottle and set the bottle aside. Take your glue and apply it around the bottom of the spray nozzle cap where it meets the bottle cap. Fit the pieces snugly together, pressing them firmly. Allow them to dry. Once they are, fill the pill bottle with water and put the cap back on the bottle. Your water gun is complete.


If the spray nozzle keeps coming off of the cap, try a different type of glue or use a glue gun. The glue you originally used may not be strong enough to stand up to the movements of the water gun."
"
Collect your materials.,
Drill a hole in the pump.,
Tape the nozzle needle.,
Assemble your gun.",How to Make a Water Gun3," This water gun is made by converting a sports ball air pump into a water gun. These are the small air pumps that are used to refill the air in basketballs, soccer balls, and footballs. To make it, you will need a hand operated sports ball air pump, plumbers tape, a drill, and a pair of scissors.You may also be able to use a small hand operated bicycle tire pump as well if you want a slightly larger gun.

, Take the air pump and remove the nozzle at the end, putting it aside. Find a drill bit that fits into the hole in the top of the pump. Take the drill and drill through the metal area on the inside of the pump. Make sure you don't strip the sides of the hole. The nozzle needs to be able to screw back in there.


Make sure the handle lever is pulled out. You don't want to accidentally puncture that part of the pump.

, The nozzle of the air pump should have multiple holes along the needle and one on the end. Using a long piece of the plumbers tape, cover up all the holes except the one at the end of the needle. You want to make sure you wrap it around the area where the hole is as well as the surrounding areas. You don't want any water to leak out of those areas once you start shooting your gun.If you want, you can paint the outside of the pump in a fun color or in a cool design. Using outdoor spray paint or some other waterproof paint, paint the pump and let it dry before you assemble it.

, Take the pump and stick it in water with the lever all the way in. Once the end is submerged in water, pull back the lever to fill the pump with water. Next, screw the nozzle back on the gun. To release the water, just push in the pump lever."

Consider using a small pistol.,
Check the pistol.,
Slide the pistol into the holster.,
Consider wearing a belt.,
Grip the handle of the gun.,
Position the holster.,
Push the paddle underneath the waistband.,
Adjust the position as necessary.,
Draw the pistol as needed.,
Wear loose clothes to conceal the pistol.,
Know how to remove the holster.",How to Wear a Paddle Holster," If you intend to use a paddle holster for a concealed carry weapon, consider choosing a firearm with a short barrel.Most paddle holsters will hold the pistol low and angle it away from your body. As a result, the bottom of the holster and/or firearm has a tendency to peek out from beneath the average shirt or jacket when the holster is used for a long-barreled pistol.
If you do not want to use a short-barreled pistol, you might be able to avoid this problem by wearing the holster higher on the waist. Note that you will need to wear the waistband of your pants higher on your waist, as well, for this option to work.;
, Before going any further, make sure that the pistol is safe by verifying that the safety is on.


If you intend to carry a loaded pistol, the pistol should be loaded before you insert it into the holster.
If you do not wish to carry a loaded pistol, make sure that it is not loaded before you proceed.

, Grab the handle of the pistol, then slide the barrel of the pistol into the holster. Continue until the entire gun is securely seated in the body of the holster.


Keep your finger off the trigger and along the side of the gun as you handle it.
If your holster has a button latch, fold the latch down and snap it in place to further secure the weapon.

, While not always necessary, wearing a belt can help keep the paddle holster more secure.


Wear a belt if your pants feel loose or saggy. Keeping your pants secure around your waist will make the holster more comfortable and safer to use.
Even if your pants fit well without a belt, the use of a belt is still recommended. Paddle holsters are held in place with tension. By putting another layer (the belt) in between the side of the holster and the holster clip, you create more tension and keep the holster more secure.
Note that most paddle holsters work best with belts that are 2 inches (5 cm) wide or smaller.

, Grab the holster by gripping the handle of the gun. Make sure that the firearm is securely seated in the holster before continuing.


As before, you should keep your fingers off the trigger and outside of the trigger guard.
The pistol and holster should move as one. If they don't, the firearm may not be seated in the holster securely enough, and this could pose a safety threat if not corrected.
When you grab the pistol and holster, make sure that the rigid paddle portion of the holster faces the dominant side of your body. The firearm should face away from your dominant side.

, Position the holster at the 3-o'clock position and guide the rigid paddle portion of the holster so that it clips in between your pants and underwear.The paddle must be in between your pants and underwear. It should not be hooked loosely around the belt.
Use the 3-o'clock position if you are right-handed or the 9-o'clock position if you are left-handed.
If this position feels uncomfortable or unnatural to you, you can easily adjust it later. Many paddle holsters are designed to work with the angle of your body based on this position, however, making it the best one to start with.

, Push the positioned paddle completely beneath the waistband of your pant.Continue pushing the paddle downward as far as it will go.
If your paddle holster has a security clip or hook along the underside of the paddle, it may hear or feel it click into place once the paddle slides past the seam of your waistband. This security clip will help prevent the holster from sliding out when you go to retrieve your gun., Since the paddle is not locked into any specific position, you can slide the holster around your waist until it settles into a comfortable, natural point along the curve of your body.Generally, you will need to position the holster somewhere between your side and mid-back.
Regardless of where you keep the holster, keep in mind that you must be able to grab the gun and remove it from the holster in a single, fluid motion. Otherwise, the holster is not serving its designated purpose.

, When you need to draw your pistol, grab the handle of the gun with your dominant hand and lift it straight up. Once the barrel has cleared the holster, grip the firearm with both hands and aim as needed.


If the holster has a button latch, you will need to unsnap the latch before removing the gun.
The tension and lip on the clip of the paddle should hold the holster in place as you remove the gun, especially if you lift the gun straight up.
Keep your fingers away from the trigger until you are ready to shoot. Make sure that the gun is properly and safely aimed before placing your finger on the trigger and firing the gun.

, As an out-of-the-waistband holster, you will need to wear a long, loose top capable of covering the pistol and holster to conceal it. The top can be a shirt or jacket, but either way, it must be long enough to hide the entire holster from sight.Paddle holsters are notoriously bulky due to the way they angle out from the body, so you will probably notice a bulge if your top is too tight. For that reason, it is strongly recommended that you wear loose clothes over the paddle holster, instead.

, To remove the holster, grab the handle of the gun and use it to tilt the paddle toward your body and away from the side of your pants. With the paddle tilted, lift the weapon up and out.


If you do not tilt the paddle in this manner, it might get stuck on the waistband of your belt when you try to remove it. The pistol could accidentally come out if you carelessly allow the holster to get stuck.

Purchase your piping.,
Create or buy a dowel.,
Find a handle or grip.,
Get a potato.,
Have other supplies.",How to Make a Spud Gun1," The best way to propel bits of potato is with a piece of copper piping. Visit a hardware store to purchase a copper pipe.The inner diameter of the pipe should be ⅝ inches. Ask someone at the hardware store to assist you find the right size.


While at the store see if they’ll cut the pipe for you. A good size for the pipe is anywhere from ½ a foot to a full foot.
If you want, you could use a PVC pipe with the same diameter. Any pipe will work, but copper is durable and can withstand years of use.
The average overall length is half an inch, depending on what pipe you choose.;
, A dowel is a long cylindrical rod typically made of wood. You’ll need a dowel that is exactly ⅝ inches to fit into the piping. It’s important to use the same size to create the necessary air pressure to fire the spuds. The dowel should also be slightly larger than your piping.


You should be able to purchase the exact size at your hardware store.
If you have a small wooden block that is thin, but larger than ⅝”, sand it to size. Hold the sandpaper in your palm with the coarse part facing out. Put the wood in your hand. Twist and move the plank until you form a cylinder.
Use a tape measure or frequently check if the wood fits into the pipe. Try to make the dowel even.

, To properly hold the potato gun, you’ll need to add a grip. You can either use bicycle handlebar tape or an old school tricycle’s handgrip. This isn’t necessary, but it’ll add to the look and accessibility of the spud shooter.


You can usually find the handgrip at a thrift store or at a bike shop.

, To shoot out potatoes, you’ll need to use potatoes as ammo. Use older potatoes that have started to sprout, if you have any at your home. One potato contains over a hundred shots of ammunition.


Any type of potato will work.

, It’s good to keep other supplies and tools on hand when working on your spud gun. Keep coarse sandpaper on hand for modifying your dowel. You should also have duct tape or electrical tape."

Troubleshoot the gun.",How to Make a Spud Gun2," The bicycle grip or tricycle handle will be mounted to one end of the dowel. If you have modern handlebar tape, you can simply wrap it around one end of the dowel. Handlebar tape comes with an adhesive side. Attach the tricycle handle using tape.


If you messed up one side of your dowel, attach the grip to this side.
Wrap tape around the tricycle handle and the dowel until it feels secure.

, Insert the dowel into the piping. If you went to the hardware store for the proper sizes, the dowel should fit. You will probably need to sand the dowel down slightly. Sanding the dowel will make it easier to push through the piping.


Again, hold the sandpaper in your palm with the coarse side facing out. Then twist and stroke the dowel in small increments with the sandpaper.
Take caution when sanding down the dowel. You don’t want to create too large of a gap. The spud gun functions based off of air pressure. The source of air pressure is between the tightness of the dowel and piping.

, Wedge one side of the piping into a potato. When you remove it, there should be a chunk of potato in the pipe. Insert the dowel at the opposite end of the piping. Keep the dowel crowned in the pipe until you’re ready to fire.


With all of your force, jam the dowel towards the potato. The piece of spud should go hurling out of your contraption.
You should hear a popping sound and a faint hint of smoke (potato debris)., If the spud didn’t shoot, you may need to take a look at your contraption. Make sure that the piping is straight and smooth. Look over pipe for any dents and ensure the pathway is clear. Check if your pipe has a rough edge around the opening. File it down if there is a sharp edge.


Use either a nail file or a metal file depending on what type of pipe you are using.
Check to see if the spud is wedged firmly in the pipe. There can’t be any gaps for the spud to successfully fire. Also, you’ll need to empty the spud from the piping completely before reloading."

Use the rubber band to launch other things.,
Don’t aim hard objects at anyone’s face.",How to Fire a Rubber Band2," Tired of the rubber band catching the back of your hand and leaving you with a welt? Get your hand out of the way! Hook a rubber band on the tip of your pen or pencil, pull it back and let it fly. For the best possible accuracy, point the tip of the pen in the direction you want the rubber band to go.

, If you want to get creative, use rulers, the corners of books, and other objects to fling your rubber band. Think outside the box. The tip of your glue bottle? Perfect rubber band launcher. The head of a WWE wrestling action figure? Now you're thinking.


Ideally, you want to use something firm enough to stay steady when you pull the rubber band back on it, but you could also experiment with bendable objects if you want. See what works.

, The rubber band works just as well as a launcher as it does a launchee. Use the rubber band to launch:


Wads of paper
Paperclips
Skittles and other candy

, Bummer alert: Be very careful any time you fire rubber bands or other things and make sure that you don't aim them at anyone's face. It's better not to aim rubber bands at someone at all, especially if you're in class. Firing things around the classroom in general can get you into a lot of trouble with the teacher, so be careful.

Find a solid stick, preferably with a curve.,
Sand the wood down.,
Glue a clothes pin on the top of the “gun.” To fire the rubber band, you'll want to glue a rubber band to the top of the ""barrel"" of the gun, preferably right where you'll be able to activate it with your thumb while you're holding it.,
Cut a notch into the front tip.,
Hook a rubber band between the notch and the clothes pin.",How to Fire a Rubber Band3," If you want to build a simple rubber band gun, you'll need to find a great stick to do it. The best sticks will be hefty and gun-shaped, with a slight curve that you can hold like a handle. So, look around for a good stick about 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) long in total, and about an inch wide, if possible. If it looks gun-shaped, you've got a good one.

, Get an adult to help you, if necessary, to remove the bark and other junk from the outside of the wood. Whittle it away so you've got the clean wood underneath and spend some time sanding it down with some sandpaper. If you're going to go to the trouble to make a gun, you might as well make it look awesome.

, To attach the clothes pin:


Set the clothes pin on the side, so the flat side of the pinchers will be flat against the top of the barrel.
Use wood glue to run a long line of glue along that side of the clothes pin.
Secure it in place and hold it while the glue dries.

, Again, get an adult to help you, and use a knife to cut a small notch in the front of the barrel of the gun, big enough to seat the rubber band in firmly.

, To fire the gun, you'll hook the rubber band on the front of the barrel, then catch it in the clothes pin on the top of the gun. When you're ready to fire, aim the gun where you want it to go, and push the top lever on the clothes pin down. The rubber band should come loose and go flying.


While it might be cool to paint your rubber band gun, you need to be extremely careful to make sure it doesn't look like a real-enough gun to get you into trouble. The last thing you need is someone to call the cops about a kid running around with a gun. Have fun, but be safe."

Find a suitable piece of wood for the stock and barrel.,
Collect the rest of your rubber band rifle parts.,
Attach a clothespin to your stock to act as your release.The best placement for your clothespin depends on the kind of rifle you intend on making.,
Notch your stock at the front of the barrel.Use a knife or a cutting tool, like a small woodworking saw, to cut a notch in the front of your stock where your barrel comes to an end.,
Arm your rubber band rifle with ammunition.,
Test tension and sturdiness.,
Test fire your new rubber band rifle.",How to Make a Rubber Band Gun1," The stock and barrel of your rubber band rifle should be made of a material soft enough that you can cut a groove into it. Wood is likely the cheapest and most readily available option, though bamboo and similar materials can also make an effective stock.

Your stock should be about two feet (60 cm) in length.
You can find suitable wood for your stock from a sturdy tree branch, a hardware store, or a lumber yard.
Spare handles for tools, frequently sold at hardware stores, are an excellent option to consider.;
, In addition to your stock and barrel, you'll need a release along with something to attach your rubber band release to your gun. All in all, you'll need:

Clothespin (for release)
Pencil
Glue (wood glue, superglue, etc.)
Knife
Rubber band

, A high powered rubber band rifle can be made by attaching your clothespin farther back on the stock. Normal rifles should have the clothespin attached ⅔ of the way from the front toward the back of your stock. To attach your clothespin:


Mark your stock with a pencil or knife at the location you plan on attaching your clothespin.
Use a glue, like wood glue, superglue, or hot glue, to attach your clothespin to your stock.
Allow sufficient time for your glue to fully dry.
Note: the farther back you put your clothespin, the more pressure your rubber band will exert on the pin. If you place your pin too far back, your clothespin might not be strong enough to hold your rubber band in place.

, This will be where you load your rubber band.

, Take a rubber band and put one end of it into the notched part of your stock at the tip of the barrel. Then pull your rubber band back, stretching it all the way to the clothespin. Open your clothespin and:


Hold your rubber band so that it is behind the teeth of your clothespin.
Close your clothespin to trap the rubber band on the inside of the clothespin.

, Using your finger, push and pull lightly on your armed rubber band to make sure the notch you have cut is deep enough. Then, inspect your clothespin to ensure it is sturdy enough to withstand the tension of your rubber band.


If the band slips free easily, you may want to use your cutting tool to cut your notch a little deeper.
If your clothespin does not seem sturdy enough, you may want to apply some more glue or an additional fastener, like duct tape.

, Aim your rifle by looking down stock, using the clothespin and end of the barrel to sight your target. When, looking down the barrel of your rubber band rifle, you see your target right above both your clothespin and the tip of your barrel, down on the clothespin to release the rubber band.


At maximum tension, the rubber band should fire about 15 to 20 yards (13.7 to 18.3 m).

Pull your strip free to release your rubber band.",How to Make a Rubber Band Gun2," To make yourself a more realistic rifle, you'll need a board about three feet (90 cm) long and six inches (15 cm) wide. You should be able to purchase a board for this purpose from your local hardware store or lumber yard.

, In addition to the wood that you will form into the main body of your rubber band rifle, you will also need ammunition and supplies to help you cut your wood into the shape of your gun. For this project you should have:

Pencil/felt tip marker
Woodworking saw (or a common saw)
Jig saw (optional)
Duct tape (or thin leather strip)
Knife
Rubber bands

, Using a pencil or felt tip marker, draw a general outline of a rifle. Feel free to do this freehand, though you may want to use an image from online to model your outline. Generally, your rifle should have:

A long, thin barrel
A rectangular sight atop the beginning of the barrel.
A stock.
A trigger.

, Use a woodworking saw for greater precision, or a common saw if that is unavailable, and cut along the outside of the outline you drew on your board. Do this until the outline is completely cut free.

, The notch should form a wedge pointing inward on the barrel and should be thick enough to accommodate a rubber band.


In the event you don't have a jig saw, a normal saw or knife should be able to sufficiently notch the front of your barrel.

, Take a piece of duct tape or a thin strip of leather folded in half and nail or staple it onto the center of the top of where the stock meets the barrel. You will use this strip like a ""trigger,"" where by pulling the strip free you can fire your rubber band.

, Using a saw or knife, cut a notch into the top of your barrel beneath where you have attached your trigger strip. Your notch should be deep and thick enough to serve as a catch for your rubber band.

, Tuck your duct tape or leather strip into the notch you have made on the top of your barrel. Now your gun is ready to be armed with a rubber band. Place one end of your rubber band in the notch you have made at the end of your barrel and the other end over your strip and into the notch atop your barrel.

, Pull backwards on your strip of duct to release your rubber band, causing it to fire down the length of your barrel. Take aim by:


Look gown the barrel of your gun with your dominant (most likely your right) eye.
Align the top of your barrel where the notch is with the tip of your barrel as closely as you are able.
Adjust your gun until you see your target directly above both your notch and tip of the barrel.
Release your rubber band.

Pencil
Thumbtack
Hot glue gun or superglue
Clothespin
Rubber band

, Using your hot glue or superglue, attach your clothespin so it is lined up with the writing end of your pencil, with the alligator clip side facing the eraser. Allow enough time for the glue to fully dry before continuing.

, Take your thumbtack and push it into your pencil on the side opposite your clothespin. The nub of the thumbtack should give you just enough to wrap a finger around to help you grip your pencil peashooter.

, Take your rubber band and pull it so that one end catches on the eraser end of your pencil and pull the opposite between the clip end of your clothespin. Aim your weapon and open your clothespin to release and fire your rubber band."

Wood in these dimensions can be purchased at most hardware stores or lumber yards., There are some tools you should have on had so that you can fashion the piece of would you found into a really cool rubber band pistol. To make your pistol, you'll need:

Pencil (or felt tipped marker)
Saw
Knife
Rubber bands
Nails (thin kind)
Hammer

, With a pencil or felt tipped marker, draw the desired outline of your pistol on your piece of wood. You may want to refer to an online picture of a pistol to serve as a model for your drawing., Using a normal saw, follow the pistol outline you drew on your board to guide your cutting. Once you cut your pistol free, take some sandpaper and smooth any jagged edges.

, A second nail can be added to improve the stability of your clothespin.

, Use a regular saw or knife to cut a V-shaped notch into the front end of the barrel of your pistol. The resulting notch you make should be deep and wide enough to serve as a catch for your rubber band.

, Do this by catching one end of your rubber in the notch you made at the front of the barrel and pulling it into the jaws of the clothespin. While the clothespin is closed, the pistol will be loaded with a rubber band. To fire, open the clothespin and shoot the rubber band.

Pull the string to release your rubber bands.",How to Make a Rubber Band Gun5," You'll need a board that is at least one foot (30 cm) long, six inches long (15 cm), and of decent thickness. Thicker wood will result in a sturdier gun. Wood can be bought at most local hardware stores or lumber yards., The wooden board that you now have will eventually turn into the stock and barrel of your rubber band machine gun. But to transform that wood into your legendary rapid-shooter, you'll need:

Pencil (or felt tipped marker)
Saw
Knife
Rubber bands
String
Thumbtack

, Use a pencil or felt tip marker and sketch the outline of your machine gun. You may want to look up some images on line to serve as an example for your outline., Using a normal wood saw, cut along the outline you have drawn on your wood until your machine gun is free from the board. Once it is free, you can take sand paper and rub it against the edges of your wooden gun until it is smooth to the touch., Cut a notch with your knife that runs down the barrel of your wooden gun, starting where your barrel meets the stock and running along the top side. This will be the track for your pull-release string.

, Leave about one inch (2.5 cm) between your horizontal notches, and make sure your tip to tip notch running along the top of your barrel crosses all of your horizontal notches.

, Use a tack to pin your string to the very front of the barrel of your wooden gun. Lay your pull-release string atop the barrel of your gun, guiding it with your fingers so that it lays in the tip to tip track.

, Each of the horizontal notches you cut into your barrel will be a catch on which you can string your rubber band. Take one end of your rubber band and catch it on the front of your wooden gun, and pull it back until you can hook it in place onto a horizontal notch.

, By pulling on the release string quickly, you'll knock the rubber bands free one after another, creating a rapid fire, machine-gun effect. You might also think of pulling the string slowly to create a more sustained effect.

Hold the whip correctly.,
Put the whip in starting position.,
Practice smoothly bringing the whip straight up in the air.,
Create the ""loop."",
Keep a straight plane.",How to Crack a Whip1," With your feet planted shoulder-width apart, take the handle of the whip firmly in your dominant or writing hand. Hold it with a firm business handshake.









Always practice whip cracks outdoors, clear of any people, animals, or obstacles.;
, The whip itself should be untangled and unbunched, preferably trailing straight back behind you, perpendicular to your hips. It doesn't need to be perfectly straight, but make sure it's not going to catch on your leg or hip as you bring it up into the snapping position.









Always start from this position, with the whip safely behind and to the side of your body.

, All other whip crack moves are based on the basic forward whip crack. With the whip held firmly in your dominant or writing hand, bring your arm up straight up to the 12 o'clock position, as if you were pointing at the sky. Keep your elbow locked on the up motion, keeping your arm straight. To crack the whip, let your elbow bend naturally and snap your arm down firmly in front of you, keeping the whip clear of your body.









Practice bringing the whip up smoothly, and letting the weight of your arm falling do most of the work. It shouldn't be an abrupt or jerky motion, it should follow the natural motion of your arm.

, The reason the whip cracks is because one part of the whip is traveling in one direction along a straight plane while the other end of the whip is traveling in the opposite direction. This is called the loop. When you bring the handle of the whip straight up, at the apex, the end of the whip will still probably be close to the ground and traveling up. As you bring the handle down, the end of the whip moves toward the point where the handle used to be, and will ""crack"" as you abruptly change direction.









Maintaining this loop is essential to making good whip cracks. It helps to make sure you've got the whip in the right starting position.

, It's important to remember that the whip won't crack if you don't maintain a straight plane. Whether vertical or horizontal, your arm and the whip need to be in a straight line to get that distinctive cracking sound from the whip.









If you're having trouble getting the whip to crack, make sure you're bringing the whip up high enough on the initial up motion.

There are a great many materials you could use in the construction of your catapult, but at minimum you will need:


Broomstick or crank
Padding
Plywood (1/4"" to 1/2"" thick, 15"" by 18 and 1/2"")
Rope (strong, stretchy preferred, like kernmantle rope)
Screws or bolts
Weights (optional)
Wood (preferably non-flexible, like oak wood)

If using 2x4 planks collect: two pieces at 36"", one piece at 30"", four pieces at 15"", and one piece at 18"";
, Since your catapult utilizes such powerful forces to eject its payload, you will need a strong and sturdy platform for launching as well as a strong and stable foundation. Poor foundation can throw off your aim or cause your catapult to fail.


Torsion catapults, which is the technical name for a normal catapult, have historically been built with heavy, reinforced sides, as these would allow for heavier payload, greater tensile force, and greater stability., For the base of this catapult, you will use a 2x4 base supported with plywood triangles. To prepare your plywood supports, take one rectangular piece of plywood 1/4"" to 1/2"" thick, 15"" by 18 and 1/2"", and cut it diagonally into two equal triangles.

, Traditionally, spruce or fir wood were used for the throwing arm, as these woods were light and strong. Consult your local lumberyard to see if these are an affordable option and, if not, ask for some alternatives, two of which follow:


Thick PVC pipe
Metal pipe (lightweight, durable)

, You will need rope torsion to provide the launching force for your catapult. The more twists, the greater the torque, the more power your catapult will have. The amount of torsion (twisting) you can achieve is limited only by your strength and the strength of the materials you've used in making your catapult.To make your torsion handles, take a broomstick and cut into two 15 inch segments.

, Position your 36"" 2x4 flat, longways on your workbench or another suitable sturdy surface. Place your 18"" 2x4 at a right angle to your 36"" piece at 15"" from the end of the 36"" piece and screw them into place., Place it atop your 2x4 planks. The 18"" side of your plywood will be vertical to your 36"" plank, its base parallel with the 36"" plank, and its diagonal will approximately span the distance between the two ends each 2x4 plank. Screw down your triangle securely to your 2x4s. This forms one base leg of your catapult.

, In the same fashion you constructed the right side, put your 36"" and 18"" 2x4 planks at a right angle 15"" from the end of the long piece, and screw your triangular plywood piece into place atop the two 2x4 planks, with the base parallel to the 36"" 2x4.

, Using your two 15"" long 2x4 planks, screw your left and right side, with the base of your triangle and base of your 36"" 2x4 forming the bottom, leaving the hypotenuse (the diagonal) facing up.Use long screws to ensure your frame is sturdy.


Do not use nails for this part of your frame. Nails are sensitive to the stress your catapult will exert, and could come loose over time.

, Now that you have your frame constructed, you will begin working on constructing the throwing arm. The top side of your catapult will have the 18"" vertical boards pointing straight up, and your 36"" boards laying flat edgewise.

, The top of your cross brace should be level with the top of your vertical 18"" 2x4 boards.

, Take your 30"" 2x4 and measure 2.5"" from one end. Drill a 1/2"" centered hole clear on the narrow side of the board through the entire width of the 2x4.

, Screw a plastic cup to the center of the flat side of your 2x4. This should also be the opposite side from where you drilled a hole through the short side of your 2x4. Feel free to experiment with other materials and holding devices, like baskets, bowls, and cases.

, Drill a 1"" hole in each side of the base into the end with your triangular support. This hole will need to be centered 6"" from the end of the 36"" piece where the end of your plywood triangle should also end. Then measure 2.5"" up from the bottom edge of the device and drill.

, The arm of your catapult operates by being pulled or winched back after applying tension to the rope that will be laced through the frame. Where the throwing arm of your catapult meets your cross brace, it's a good idea to add padding, like a blanket or several layers of wrapped rags. This will prevent your catapult from doing damage to itself when the arm is pulled back, released, and comes in contact with the cross brace.

, You will need about 20' of rope to complete the lacing process. Tie the rope around your broomstick handle, then take it through the hole in the right side of the base, through the hole you drilled in the arm of the catapult, out the opposite side of the base and back out to your second broomstick handle. Loop it around your second handle, then take it back through the frame to your first handle, where you will loop the cord again. Do this several times.When choosing rope, look for strong material that has some stretch to it. Kernmantle rope, like parachute cord, is an excellent option.Take your cord back and forth through the frame and arm several times to ensure your rope is securely fastened to the frame.
While lacing, don't worry about keeping the rope tight. When you turn your handles, you will tighten the rope and apply launching force.

, After you have run your cord through the base of your catapult and throwing arm several times to secure it to the frame and arm, starting with your second handle, bring the end of your cord around the second handle in a loop that passes through the hole in your frame and under the throwing arm, passing through to the hole on the other side to loop around your first handle. Continue this motion, following each over-lacing of the arm with an under-lacing with each pass of the cord through the frame.


This should form a figure eight shape with your rope where you can clearly see the rope twisting together. The more twists you add through your over and under motion, the more tension and greater force your catapult will have.
After securing your rope to arm and frame, you should not continue threading your line through the throwing arm. To achieve the tension necessary to throw a projectile, you must finish lacing by going through the frame holes, around the broom handles in loops, and over and under the throwing arm.
Make sure your loops stay anchored around your broom handles.

, When you are reaching the end of your rope, wrap it around the strings to one side of your catapult, then cross over and do the same on the other side. Now you can knot the end of your cord, ensuring it won't come lose with the added benefit of keeping your rope orderly.

, As you twist your handles, the torsion of the rope will cause your throwing arm to ascend until its tension holds it against the cross brace. First allow your arm to rest fully back in the launching position and judge where to best install your catch, then drill a hole and insert your hook.


By installing a catch to the rear of your frame, you won't have to pull the arm back to launch your payload. Simply release the catch after applying tension, and your arm will spring forward, stopping at the cross brace and launching your payload.

, Your handles should now be off to each side of your catapult base, parallel to your 36"" pieces and attached to the frame and throwing arm by rope. Turn the handles to create torsion in the rope.This will give the catapult tension, simply add a payload to your cup, wind your broomstick cranks, release your catch and fire.

Do an overhand crack.,
Try a sidearm crack.,
Try the coachman's crack.",How to Crack a Whip2," If the forward crack resembles a tai-chi motion, the overhand crack resembles a baseball pitch. Put your non-dominant foot forward slightly, and instead of bringing the whip up, rotate your shoulder back and bring the whip straight forward over your shoulder as if you were throwing a ball.









Your starting position for this whip crack needs to have the whip laid out in front of you, rather than behind you.

, This motion resembles the motion used to skip stones across a body of water. With the whip in starting position behind you, and your hand holding the whip facing palm out, away from your body, bring the whip forward in a horizontal motion.









This crack can be used as part of a combination crack. After bringing the whip forward, adjust your footing to stand straight up and bring the whip back over your shoulder to complete a second forward crack. This looks and sounds more complicated than it is. Be careful not to bring the whip back into your face if you attempt this., This is the kind of whip crack you might use to drive horses on a stagecoach, and is basically a combination of the forward crack and the overhand crack. Start the crack as you would the forward crack, bringing your arm up, but keeping your arm flexed, rather than perfectly locked and straight. Flex your wrist backward at 12 o'clock position to strike the whip straight out, rather than straight down.

Release!",How to Fling a Small Object With a Ruler," You will need one small object such as a pen cap, a little aluminum wrap/paper ball, an eraser etc. Don't forget a ruler that can bend. The best one to use is those plastic rulers that are sort of thin. Wood rulers won't work. Those special bendy rulers might work if you put a little more effort and control into it.

, Put your opposite hand that you write with on the bottom of the ruler. Grab the top of it. When you place a small object on the ruler, you might want to grasp your object with a finger. But remember...when in the flinging stage, you must let go of your object, or, the ruler might go flipping in the air. Also, if you do it incorrectly, the ruler will flip in the air.

, Remember, the farther you bend it, the more force. It could go 20 feet (6.1 m) in the air if you know what you're doing! But, don't bend it too much, you'll break your ruler...which would suck.

, Bend it back just a little more, and don't lose your object. If you do, just repeat the steps over again.

, Let your writing hand which should be on the top go, and, if you did it properly, your object will go flying.

, It shouldn't be too big. 8–9 inches (20.3–22.9 cm) wide is enough. It should be thick, too, for better results.;
, One end should be slightly bigger. It should be the left end. Reverse if you are a lefty.

, The object that works best for this method is one of those cap erasers you put on pencils.

, You don't need that much pressure, just enough. Make sure the cap eraser on the left is still perfectly on the left side. You can hold it down with your other hand if it slips.

, Be sure to still put pressure on the right side. Pull the left side all the way back to the table. It should have been high in the air. The higher it was when you just applied pressure to the right side, the more power. But if it was too high, then it is not going to work too well.

, The cap eraser won't go that high, but still, it's entertaining. This version is a little trickier to get the hang of it. But don't worry, you will.

,,,,,,,, Cut two lengths of 2""-diameter pipe 30"" long and a third 6"" long. On the end of one, glue on the 2""x1"" SPIGOT x FIPT reducer bushing. To do this, glue the bushing into the coupling, then glue the coupling onto the pipe. Using the elbows, then make a U-shaped pipe, with the 6"" section as the bottom of the U. Cut the bike tube off of the valve, leaving the valve and a small flap of rubber around then the valve, about 3/4"" wide. Before gluing on the pipe end cap, drill a hole in the center of the cap just big enough for the bike valve. Insert the valve, cut from the tube, and tighten the valve on the cap using the nut. Then glue the cap on the open end of pipe. Where the female threads are, thread the 3"" long pipe nipple. Be sure to use the Teflon tape on the male threads of the nipple!

, Cut a length of 2"" diameter pipe 36"" long (remember, you can always trim this down later!), and also cut a 4"" long piece of 1""-diameter pipe. Glue the remaining reducer bushing into one end of the barrel (to do this, glue the bushing into the coupling, then glue the coupling onto the pipe), then glue the 1"" pipe into the bushing. Finally, glue the 1"" SOCKET x MIP adapter on the end of the 1"" pipe.

, Thread the air chamber into the valve. BE SURE THE AIR WILL MOVE IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION!! Air from the chamber needs to move into the IN hole of the valve, and out of the OUT hole of the valve, as indicated by arrows. Tighten down until snug, and be sure to position the valve on the chamber so there is room for the barrel.

, Thread this into the OUT hole of the valve until snug.

, 3 9v batteries wired together (in series) to make 27v works perfectly. A 12v battery will work effectively, too. Applying voltage will open the valve, cutting it off will close the valve.

Locate wood.,
Dry out your wood.,
Carve some notches.,
Cut your tubing.,
Attach the tubing to your wooden fork at the notch.,
Make your pouch.,
Slip one end of one of your rubber bands through the slit and fold it back over itself so that it makes a little loop around the edge of the pocket.,
Practice using your slingshot!",How to Make a Sling Shot1," The goal is to find the sturdiest Y-shaped piece of wood you can find. You can make a slingshot with a forked branch of just about any size, but a piece about 6 to 9 inches (15.2 to 22.9 cm) long with a fairly uniform thickness of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) will make a strong, easy-to-use slingshot.









Try to find a piece with as few imperfections as possible--even moderate cracks can render your slingshot dangerous or unusable. If there are knots or bumps you can cut or sand them off.
You can peel off the bark to make the handle more comfortable to hold.;
, If you're working with wood that has recently been cut, it will contain moisture that will not make for a very sturdy sling shot. To dry your wood fork out quickly, pop in in your microwave oven.









Wrap your fork in a kitchen dish towel and pop it into the microwave. Heat it on high in a series of 30 second intervals.
After every 30 second interval, allow the wood to rest for a few seconds and listen for hissing. Once the hissing has stopped, all the moisture has been removed from the wood, and you can proceed to the next step.

, With a sharp pocket knife, make a notch towards the top of each of the fork prongs. The notch should be where you want to attach your bands. An inch or so from the end of the prong is a good location.








, ¼"" latex surgical tubing (found at hardware stores) is a good, solid option for a firing mechanism. Determine how long you want your bands to be. Shorter bands will produce more powerful shots, but you need some give to be able to pull the band back.









When you have determined the desired tube length, double it and cut it in half, yielding two tubes of equal length.

, Wrap one end of the tubing around a fork prong and back on itself to form a ""C"" shape. The tail end should approximately 1"" long.









Tightly wind a 10"" piece of dental floss around both lengths of the tubing so the tubing is firmly affixed to the wooden prong. Tie a square knot to secure the floss and trim off any excess.
Repeat this tube attachment on the other wooden prong.

, You can buy a rectangular piece of leather or strong cloth from a hobby or fabric store. This material should measure approximately 4"" wide by 2"" high.









Cut a slit on each side of the pouch. Use a knife to make an incision about ¼"" to ½"" in from each of the shorter edges. The slits should be just large enough for the tubing to fit through.
You can opt to trim off ½"" from all the corners of the rectangle. This octagonal shape cups and supports the rock or stone you are shooting with.

, Secure the loop (as you did when you attached the tubing to the prong) by wrapping dental floss around both lengths of tubing. Secure with a firm knot, and repeat on the other side.







, Try using small rocks or stones to shoot at targets. Use caution when shooting around people and pets.

, Take your other toilet paper tube and draw two ½"" parallel lines straight down from the rim. Use scissors to cut along the two lines. You will now have a tab.









Draw another set of identical lines on the same end of the tube, opposite the lines you just cut. Cut on these lines.
Push a rubber band into one set of slits so one end wraps around the tab. The long end of the rubber band should hang outside the tube. Repeat on the other side.

",How to Build a Desktop Catapult," See the complete list under Things You'll Need, later in the article. All the components for this project cost less than $15 (US), and there was no problem finding them.;
, The following were used in this assembly:


Circular saw
Battery and electric drills with bits
Sander
Hot glue gun
Measuring tape
Hammer
Utility knife

, You will need:


1 piece 3/4 plywood, 9X16 inches
2- 1/2 inch diameter dowels, 12 inches (30.5 cm) long
2- 1/2 inch diameter dowels, 18 inches (45.7 cm) long
4- 1/4 inch diameter dowels, 18 inches (45.7 cm) long
2- 1/4 inch diameter dowels, 16 inches (40.6 cm) long
2- 3/8 inch diameter dowels, 7 inches (17.8 cm) long
3- 3/8 inch diameter dowels, 18 inches (45.7 cm) long
various spacer blocks cut from the dowels listed above
various lengths of twine to lash dowels together while assembling. These lashings give the catapult its structural soundness.

, Mark the board lengthwise at 1 inch (2.5 cm) and 9 inches (22.9 cm) with a framing square or rule, then mark the center line, from which you measure out 3 inches (7.6 cm) either way for the holes.

, These holes are drilled perpendicular to the board.

,, These are the holes for the cross beams to fit into.

, Drive the 12 inch (30.5 cm) by 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) dowels into the holes at the one inch marks, they should intersect the vertical dowels at their tops. Some carpenter's wood glue applied to the ends of these dowels will help hold them securely in place.

, Hot melt wood glue will save a lot of time on this step, and a dab of glue will help secure the lashing twine when it is knotted.

, If these are not snug enough, glue them in place.

,, The spaces should be located so that the pivot point is an open space about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) wide, which will be the location for it to be placed on the pivot beam. Leave another space about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) long at the top end of this assembly (the launch arm). This is where the cup, or projectile holder will fit.

,, This can be carved by hand if you prefer, since it will be a fairly small piece of wood to hold securely while using your power tools for carving.

, You will want to be certain to lash this tightly and glue the lashings in place to avoid accidentally launching the complete cup when you fire the catapult.

, These will keep the launch arm assembly in line while it swings during launch. If the arm and pivot bar are tight enough to keep the assembly in alignment, these pieces can be left off.

, Adjust the tension so that the launch arm can be drawn back to a horizontal position for loading and firing. Using a stronger spring will make your catapult more powerful, but this is not always desirable, since it causes a lot of stress on the moving components. Most hardware stores have an assortment of various springs, so you may need to experiment a bit here to find one that works for you.

, Pull back the launch arm and release it from various draws to determine the range and power you are looking for. If none of the parts become loose or lose tension, you can launch similar size and weight projectiles with remarkable consistency using this device.

Shoot it!",How to Make Blowgun Darts," As a rule, smaller darts will fly faster. Heavier darts will hit harder.This makes a difference whether you want to use your blowgun for precision work (like shooting against a dartboard) or breaking things (like glass). Fundamentally, the process is the same. However, knowing what you want to use your darts for is important before you go out and buy the materials.


The sort of tip you ultimately give your dart will have a significant impact on its use as well.;
, There are usually two or three parts to a dart. All blowgun darts will have a nail (for impact) and a flight (the part at the end for aerodynamics). Flights can be made by wrapping small pieces of paper into cones. A third part to the dart may be the tip. In some cases, you may want to modify the end of the dart. Whether for safety or utility's sake, you can add something to change your dart's impact.


Type #16 and #18 wire nails are recommended for blowgun darts. Choose between the two based on your preference between speed and impact.Sticky notes are perfect for the flight.They're already a good size so you won't need to cut off too much. They're also often brightly coloured, which will make it easier to retrieve your darts once you begin firing them.
A tip of a dart can be anything, so long as it doesn't get the way of the dart's natural aerodynamics. For use in your house, some tape to dull the pointy end can help, although some will use a tip to make a dart more damaging.

, Because this is a homemade project, you can go many ways about making a flight for your darts. As mentioned, easy flights can be made by rolling sticky notes into cones.Form them into a cone, and tape the crease to keep them steady. Alternatively, you can glue short pieces of yarn around an ear plug. From there, the nail can impale through the ear plug and function just as well as a dart.In order to find the perfect length for your cone flights to be, try sticking them n the barrel you'll be using. Cut off at the point where the cone doesn't fit in.Try to make your darts consistently. It helps to get really good at one kind of dart. What's more, you'll adjust your shooting style to match the weight and impact of that type of ammunition.

, A nail is usually simple to add to your flight. This involves sticking it through the central part of the flight and bringing it all the way forward. In the case of a cone flight, stick the nail through the back end so that the flathead is covered by the cone. From there, hot glue the nail in place. Once the nail is settled, you are ready to add a tip.

, Just as with the making of the dart frames themselves, tipping darts begins with a choice. Before giving darts a tip, you should have a solid idea what you'll be using the darts for, and what you'll likely be aiming them at. Soft tipped darts aren't likely to puncture or break things, so they can be used in indoor settings without fear of damaging anything. In contrast, hard-tipped darts can be used to puncture or shatter targets. Tipping darts doesn't generally take as much time as making the rest of the dart, but the possibilities are much more varied.


For the sake of safety, if you're just starting out with making darts, it's recommended you begin with soft-tipped darts. That way, you can perfect your craft before moving trying something that could potentially hurt someone. For this reason, soft-tipped darts are becoming more popular.You can make projectiles from most anything. Just make sure there is enough mass to the projectiles for them to gather velocity.

, Most dart styles have a pointed tip. This allows the dart to puncture its target.If you've made your own darts using a nail for the flight, your dart will come pre-equipped with a hard-tipped puncture dart. If you have precision metalworking equipment, you can sharpen the nail tip further or dull the end.

, Taping the nail end is a quick way of giving yourself a functional soft-tip. Tape will dull off the end and lessen the risk of your darts puncturing anything. It should be kept in mind, however, that this approach does not make the darts totally safe. For a truly safe soft-tipped dart, you will want to replace the nail with something different.

, To make a glass breaker, you should remove the nail shaft from your dart. Using the hole it's created in the cone, slide a small screw in, with the screw head facing forward. These screws should be kept fairly small. They need to be small enough to be projected, and it doesn't take a lot of size to shatter a glass target.


Metal head darts can be purchased professionally as well, if you ant something that packs extra punch but don't want to invest the time in making it., One dart could technically suffice, but it makes more sense to rack up, at least, a few of them. That way, you can use the blowgun without having to retrieve the dart each time.

, The same as with the blowguns themselves, you can simply choose to buy darts from a professional outlet if you lack the time, materials or skill for it.Outlets like Cabela's have a solid variety of different dart types you can purchase from. If you're thinking of hunting with a blowgun, it's recommended you use professional ammunition.


Expert blowgun users may go as far as to modify professional darts after they buy them. It requires professional-grade metalworking equipment for customizations to reasonably benefit you however.

, Marshmallows are very light, so they tend to shoot very far with a regular amount of force from the blowgun. They can be bought cheaply in bulk from a grocery store, and are completely safe to shoot around indoors.


You can make a fun game out of using marshmallows . You can try to shoot a marshmallow into someone's mouth from a distance. This is great for parties., They're usually small and light, so they're perfect for use in a blowgun. Paintballs can get pretty messy, so they're only recommended for use outdoors.


Paintball repeaters are available for purchase.They attach to the mouthpiece end of a blowgun and load a new paintball with the press of a button.

, There are pre-made targets for blowguns you can purchase online.Otherwise, part of the fun of using a blowgun is experimenting with all of the different things you can shoot at. Try combining different types of targets with different kinds of darts and see how different combos turn out.


It is recommended in the long run that you make a wide variety of darts. Certain types of darts favour certain activities, but you're bound to have the most fun if you have the widest range of opportunities at your disposal.

, If you're not a DIY type of person, blowguns can be purchased fairly easily at a hunting or firearms store.Generally speaking, the blowguns you get professionally will be more effective than something homemade, and if you're looking for a quick fix, it's something you should look into before putting the time aside to make one yourself.


On that note, you can buy darts as well. However, purchasing everything from a store would rob you of some of the satisfaction of using one you made yourself.

, Traditional blowguns were fashioned from hollowed wood. For your own blowgun, there are different sorts of material you can use. If you want to make it natural, river can and bamboo are recommended, as they are already mostly hollow. Assuming you don't have easy access to these supplies, a half-inch PVC pipe is perfect.You can buy these at a hardware store.


A precision cutting knife is necessary to cut pieces down to size.
If you're using something other than a PVC pipe for your gun chassis, you'll need something to burn and smooth out the insides. A ramrod is best if you're working with solid wood. A red-hot steel tip is good for bamboo or river cane, as it will burn out the excess materials inside.
Making a blowgun from a regular, solid piece of wood is not recommended, especially if you haven't done something like this before. All the same, if you do want to try it, you'll need to have a length of wood that could be shaped into a straight pole with a half-inch diameter inside of it. As the hollowing process is time-consuming, you can expect to spend several times the amount of time on this than with other types of blowgun.

, A blowgun can be any length between three and seven feet.Longer blowguns generally mean longer ranges, although they're harder to carry and properly aim. Using a precision knife, cut your PVC pipe (or natural substitute) to a length that suits you. If this is your first time building a blowgun and you don't know where to start, make a shorter one. Three-foot blowguns are easiest to use, and you'll get the hang of it without using too much material.


Make sure your cut is clean and straight. Rough or slanted edges will increase drag in the barrel.

, A blowgun can always use a cool look. If you're making something from home, part of the enjoyment is in making it look as professional as possible. For the look and traction, it's recommended you wrap it up in a coloured masking tape.Buy a coloured tape from a hardware store you think suits the blowgun. Set the blowgun lengthwise against the blowgun and pull the tape up to wrap partway around it. From there, turn it around and do the same on the other side.


Look up professional designs for blowguns if you need some inspiration on how to cover up your gun., In general, blowguns are simple devices. The ranges you'll be shooting from won't make it necessary to have aim assistance, but it can make a fun addition for your blowgun. A laser pointer is perfect for this, as they're very cheap and relatively powerful. Buy one from a dollar store. Set some hot glue 8 1/2 inches away from the firing end of your blowgun and glue it down. Take care to make sure the laser pointer runs perfectly parallel with the gun barrel.Tape down the laser pointer with some tape to secure it further.
Many laser pointers also come equipped with a flashlight, making your blowgun capable in night situations as well.Calibrating a scope or laser-assisted aim takes patience. Tape your laser in a place you think you want it to go. Keep shooting in the same place at an optimal range and adjust your scope if the dart doesn't hit where the aim indicates it will go. Set glue and secure it when you've decided on a placement.

, Find a safe target, and have some practice. Lodge a dart in one side, and blow it out the other. Experiment with different arcs and velocities. It helps to have a strong set of lungs.

Gather your materials.,
Wrap the head of a nail in your small piece of paper.,
Place your dart snugly into the conduit to measure and cut.,
Place the dart in your conduit, aim, and fire.",How to Make a Blowgun1,"


4 or 5 feet (1.2 or 1.5 m) piece of conduit with 1/2"" inside walls
Ring shank nails
Small piece of typing paper (2"" x 3"")
Scissors
Masking or painter's tape

If you don't have these, consider using method 2 below.

;
, Place it in the corner and wrap it -- what should form is a cone. This is your dart. The cone-shaped end centers the dart in your gun, giving it direction and speed.


Once it's tight around the head of your nail, tape it in place. You'll want the first piece of tape to catch the nail and the paper. One or two pieces of tape will ensure it's sturdy and won't fall apart.
The heavier the dart, the more penetration you'll have. So, if you'd like, add more and more tape to make it heavier.

, Don't worry -- it's not supposed to fit at this point. You just want to place it in to the point where a light line forms on the paper -- where the conduit stops. This shows you how long your dart should be.


Cut the paper at this slight indentation. You'll be left with a dart that fits perfectly in the hollow of your conduit tube.

, That's it! With the dart in the tube and a big breath, that dart will go flying for a solid 50 feet (15.2 m). Experiment to see how powerful yours is.


Make a whole bunch of darts so you have plenty of ready-to-fire ammo.

Get ready to launch!",How to Build a Basic Catapult2," This catapult uses the same basic supplies as the catapult from Method 1, but uses torsion, or twisting force, to propel its payload.This catapult is also quick to build and a lot of fun to fire!10 standard (4.5"") craft sticks
4-5 elastic bands
1 bottle cap
A hot glue gun and glue stick
Ammunition: small marshmallows, beans, and pencil erasers are all great choices!

, This will form the fulcrum of your catapult. Stack 5 craft sticks together and secure with rubber bands at both ends.

, Align one craft stick perpendicular to the stack and center it, leaving 1/3"" hanging below the stack. Attach the throwing arm to the stack with 1-2 elastic bands, wrapped in a crisscross pattern.


The more secure the attachment, the more spring you will get from your catapult.

, Arrange the catapult so the stack of craft sticks is laying on the table, and the throwing arm is sticking up.


Add a small dab of hot glue to each end of the stack and glue a craft stick to each end.
Add another dab of glue to the end of each support you just added, and use an additional craft stick to attach the two ends, creating a rectangular base.

, This step is optional, but will add additional stability and power to your craft stick catapult.


Cut or break off a 2-inch piece of craft stick.
Add a dab of hot glue to the middle of the support beam that is parallel to the fulcrum stack, and attach the piece of craft stick.
Thread an elastic band over the throwing arm, and pull the end under the base of the catapult and secure it to the craft stick stub you just created.

, Add a small dab of hot glue to the end of the throwing arm, and press the bottle cap into the glue, holding it in place for a few seconds while the glue cools.

, Load your ammunition of choice into the bottle cap. Hold the catapult frame securely to the table with one hand. Pull down on the lever arm with the other hand, and then let go! This catapult should have a longer range and more accuracy than the basic craft stick catapult in Method 1.

Fire your catapult!",How to Build a Basic Catapult3," This catapult design project is used to teach engineering skills to children. It builds a slightly more complex torsion catapult than the previous methods, but requires just a few additional supplies and steps.10 standard (4.5"") craft sticks
1 jumbo (6"") craft stick
1 drinking straw
1 6"" length of wooden dowel, with a small enough diameter to fit through the straw
1 elastic band
Glue gun and glue stick
1 milk jug lid or large bottle cap
Ammunition! Ping pong balls and grapes both work well with this catapult project.

, These will hold the dowel/straw fulcrum that will support the throwing arm. Add a dab of glue 1/2"" from the top of a craft stick, and attach another stick to it at approximately a 30 degree angle. Create a second upright that is the mirror image of the first.

, Place a dab of hot glue on each of the bottom legs of the first upright, and attach a craft stick connecting the two so that the vertical portion of the upright attaches to the end of the base. Repeat this process with the second upright. Then use hot glue to attach one additional craft stick to the front of each of the uprights.


The base should now form a rectangle with one end open, and the two uprights sticking up parallel to one another.

, Cut a 2"" length of straw and slide the dowel through it. Use hot glue on to attach the dowel firmly to the wedge formed at top of the each upright.

, First loop an elastic band around the craft stick that connects the two uprights. Then glue the large craft stick to the straw so that about 1/2"" hangs below the straw. Finally, carefully attach the other end of the rubber band near the bottom of the large craft stick.


The throwing arm should now be able to rotate freely around the dowel on the straw, and the elastic band will put tension on the throwing arm as you pull it back.
To create a strong bond with the throwing arm, use a pencil or other tool to press the elastic band firmly into the hot glue, and hold it for a few seconds until the glue cools. Do not use your fingers or you will burn yourself!

, Your catapult is nearly ready to go, but a few more steps will make it sturdier and easier to use!


Attach the milk jug lid to the free end of the throwing arm with a dab of hot glue.
Attach one additional craft stick horizontally to connect the slanted sides of the two uprights and provide additional stability.
Add additional craft sticks to the bottom of the catapult that out as needed to keep the machine stable while firing.

, Load a ping pong ball or grape into the milk jug lid. Pull back the throwing arm and let fly!

Carry extra darts on your straw.",How to Make a Blowgun2,"


Small pieces of paper, about 1"" x 3""
Tape
Toothpicks
Scissors
Straw
A sharpened pencil

, Start in the corner so it forms a cone shape. Get it nice and tight, lining up with the very tip of the lead.


Once you have the cone tip formed, tape it together. Don't worry -- it won't be a perfect cone. You should still have the edge of the paper sticking out at the top.

, You want it the size of your toothpick. To do this:


Insert the tip of your toothpick through your cone.
If you cannot, make a snip ever so small at the tip of the cone.
Reinsert the tip of your toothpick. If it fits snugly, you're good to go.

, Most of it will still jut out. Place it in snugly so a crease or indentation forms lightly where the edge of the straw hits the paper.


At the top of the straw, where this indentation is, cut off the rest of the cone. This will leave you with a tiny cone that'll fit the tip of your toothpick, giving it direction, speed and and the ability to fly.

, You want the end of the toothpick sticking out just slightly. Make sure the tape is securely attached to both the toothpick and the paper cone.

, That's it. Take a big breath, blow in, and shoot whatever target you're aiming for. Try a piece of fruit or some balloons. Definitely not your brother or sister.

, If you want to get fancy, you can create a makeshift dart holster on your straw. This way, you can reload and fire with swiftness and ease. Here's how:


Cut pieces of straw about half the length of the dart.
Place some double-sided tape toward the end of the straw.
Place the pieces of straw in a circle on the tape.
Put more tape on top of the straw pieces, securing them in place.
Insert your darts. They should stay right in place!

Remove the dart from the target carefully.",How to Make a Blowgun from CPVC Pipe," Choose the straightest you can find. Don't worry if it has a slight bend.


When shooting, compensate for the bend by angling the blowgun upwards and gravity will do the rest.;
, If the blowgun is for children or short distance shooting, cut 2-3 feet. Otherwise, use 4 feet. Shorter, and the gun will be less accurate. Longer, and it will be quite unwieldy.

, This will make it far easier to aim.

, Make sure it is at least 8x8 inches. The bigger it is, the easier the target is to hit. A good width is 3/4 inches


If you need to cut the Styrofoam, you can use a heated knife. This prevents the flakes from going everywhere. Make sure there is good ventilation as the fumes can be harmful.

, Include a bulls-eye, and optionally a few other rings for aiming.


Another simpler possibility is to print out a cover and tape it on. Put a weight or attach the target to a surface for practice.

, Put the dart into the gun and push it about half-an inch in. Aim by putting your lips to the blowgun and focusing your eyes on the target.

, Making a ""phhh"" noise can help.


Don't blow with all your strength as this will not be effective.
If the dart is stuck, you may need a smaller one.

, Otherwise it can damage both the target and the dart.


Wood targets will be harder to remove. Use a two handed grip and pull slowly and steadily.

Play until someone loses.",How to Play Yu Gi Oh!," They are usually orange (effect) or yellow (normal) in color, but there are many other colors as well. Monsters have levels, ranging from 1-12, which are indicated by the stars along the top, and a symbol in the top right corner indicating Attribute. Above the card text, the Type, the kind of monster, and monster abilities such as Tuner or Flip are written in bold. The Attack and Defense stats are listed as ATK and DEF along the bottom. Effect monsters have effects which affect the game, but normal monsters only have lore. Effect Monsters are the most commonly used type of monster, as their effects can be quite powerful. Normal monsters are not as useful, but have some good support and are used in certain types of decks. All other monster types are either Normal or Effect monsters (technically, a Ritual, Fusion, Synchro or Xyz monster is never treated as a Normal monster, even if it has no effect. If it does not have an effect, it is not treated as an Effect monster either - there is no official term for such monsters, though ""non-effect"" is sometimes used).
Tokens are a type of monster summoned by an effect. They can be represented by anything small that can indicate attack and defense position. Token cards cannot be in either deck, and can only exist face-up on the field. They are treated as Normal monsters, and are given their name, attack, defense, level, attribute, and type by the card used to summon them. Official Token cards are gray.
Xyz monsters, Fusion monsters, and Synchro monsters cannot exist in the hand or deck, and must go in the Extra Deck. Xyz monsters have black backgrounds, and Ranks instead of Levels. Synchro monsters are white, and Fusion monsters are violet. They each have their own specific summoning methods and must first be Special Summoned using that method before they can be summoned any other way (revived from the Graveyard, etc.). Some of these monsters have special requirements for the monsters used to summon them (known as the materials), which are written on the first line of the text.
Ritual monsters are blue, and also cannot be summoned unless they are first Ritual Summoned using a Ritual Spell. Most of them are not very useful because you must have the correct spell, monster, and tributes all at the same time, but there are exceptions.
Pendulum monsters can be any type of monster, and their background color fades to the green color of spell cards on the bottom half of the card. Above the card text, there is a box which contains that card's Pendulum Effects and has the Pendulum Scales on each side. A Pendulum monster can be activated from the hand as a spell card in either Pendulum Zone, where their Pendulum Effects will be applied instead of their normal effects. Unlike Field Spells, Pendulum cards cannot be replaced by putting another Pendulum monster in the same zone. When a Pendulum monster would be sent from the field to the graveyard, it is placed face-up on top of the Extra Deck instead, where it can be resummoned to the field. If you have a Pendulum monster in both Pendulum Zones, you can perform a Pendulum Summon (more on that later).
Possible monster abilities are Tuner, Spirit, Gemini, Flip, Union, and Toon. Tuner monsters are used to perform Synchro summons. Spirit monsters return to the hand at the end of the turn they are Normal Summoned or flipped face-up. Gemini monsters are Effect monsters that are treated as Normal monsters while on the field or in the graveyard, and Effect monsters everywhere else. They do not have effects unless they are Normal Summoned a second time while they are already face-up on the field. Union monsters can equip themselves to another monster or unequip themselves and be special summoned onto the field. Flip monsters have Flip effects. A Flip effect is designated by the term ""FLIP:"", and activates when the card is flipped face-up. Toon monsters are part of the archetype ""Toon"".;
, There are three main types of summons: Normal, Special, and Flip. A Normal Summon can be done once per turn. You can Normal Summon a monster from your hand in face-up Attack Position or face-down Defense Position (called a Set). Level 4 or lower monsters do not require tributes, but for higher level monsters, you will need to send monsters from your field to the graveyard. Levels 5 and 6 require one tribute, and Levels 7 and higher require two. A summon involving tributes is also called a Tribute Summon.


A face-down monster is not revealed to your opponent. While face-down, it has no name, attribute, stats, etc. It can be flipped face up by manually changing it to Attack Position (called a Flip Summon), by an effect, or when it is attacked. A face-up monster cannot be flipped face-down, except by effect.

, A monster cannot normally be special summoned face-down, but can be summoned in either attack or defense position. The following are types of special summons.


A Fusion summon is usually done by using a Fusion spell card (like Polymerization) and sending the monsters listed on the Fusion monster to the graveyard. Certain Fusion monsters do not require Fusion spell cards (unofficially called Contact Fusion monsters). Fusion Materials are usually quite specific.
A Synchro summon is done by sending a Tuner monster and one or more non-tuner monsters from your field to the graveyard, and special summoning a Synchro monster from your Extra Deck whose level exactly matches the combined levels of the material monsters.
An Xyz summon is done by taking two or more monsters on your field with the same level and stacking them on top of each other, then stacking an Xyz monster with the same Rank on top. The monsters on the bottom are now called Xyz Materials, and are not treated as being on the field. Most Xyz monsters have effects that are activated by detaching Xyz Materials (sending them to the Graveyard). If an Xyz monster leaves the field or ceases being treated as a monster, its Xyz Materials go to the Graveyard.
A Ritual summon is usually done by using the specific Ritual Spell card, tributing a number of monsters whose levels equal the Ritual monster’s level, and special summoning the Ritual monster from your hand.
A Pendulum summon can be done if you have a Pendulum monster in both of your Pendulum Zones. You can Special summon any number of monsters in your hand and face-up on top of your Extra Deck, if their levels are between the Pendulum Scales of the two Pendulum monsters (they cannot equal the Pendulum Scales). You can only perform a Pendulum Summon once per turn.

, They are usually activated from your hand during your turn, and have various effects. There are six different types of spells, and spells other than normal spells will have an icon at the top right near the bold text indicating their type.


Normal Spell cards are played from the hand onto a S/T zone on the field, and after their effect is applied, they are sent to the graveyard.
Continuous spell cards have a ∞ symbol. After they are played onto the field, they stay there unless removed in some way, and their effects are applied as long as they are on the field.
Quick-Play Spells have a lightning bolt symbol. They can be played during any part of your turn, and, if set, during your opponent's turn.
Field spells have a four-pointed star, and go in the Field Spell Zone when activated or set. Field spells affect the whole field, and stay there unless removed. If you activate a new Field Spell while you already control one in your Field Spell Zone, the previous one is destroyed. Both players can control a Field Spell at the same time.
Equip spells have a plus symbol. When activated, they are equipped onto a face-up monster on the field, and remain on the field unless removed. An Equip Spell Card is destroyed if the monster is no longer face-up on the field or is no longer a valid target.
Ritual Spell cards are indicated by a flame, and are used in the Ritual Summoning of a Ritual Monster. They work like Normal Spells, and usually require tributes from the field to summon the specified monster from the hand.

, Traps are purple, and will have a symbol in the corner for anything other than Normal Traps. All Trap cards must be Set (placed face-down in a S/T Zone) before they can be used, and they can be activated during either player's turn.


Normal Traps can be flipped face-up when you want to use them, and when any activation requirements are met. After they resolve, they go to the graveyard.
Continuous Traps are indicated by the same ∞ symbol as Continuous Spells and function the same way.
Counter Trap Cards are indicated by an arrow. They act like Normal Traps, but the only cards that can be activated in response to them are other Counter Trap Cards.

, When they are set, they are placed face-down in an open Spell & Trap Zone. If you set a Trap or Quick-Play Spell, it can't be activated until the next turn.

, If your opponent controls no monsters, you can attack directly. Each monster can only declare an attack once per turn. If the monster it battles with is face-down, it is flipped face-up just before damage calculation.

,
If they have equal ATK, both are destroyed.
If one is in Defense position and it has less DEF than the attacking monster’s ATK, it is destroyed but its controller does not take damage.
If it has more DEF, the attacking monster’s controller takes damage equal to the difference, and neither is destroyed
If the ATK and DEF are equal, neither is destroyed.
In a direct attack, the opponent takes the ATK of the monster as damage.

, You can also choose a different attack target. If you attack with a different monster, the first monster is considered to have already attacked, and cannot attack again for the rest of the turn.

, The position they are in determines which of their stats are used for damage calculation; therefore, monsters with high attack should be in attack position, and monsters with low attack should be in defense position. Also, if one of your opponent’s monsters has a higher attack than all of yours, your monsters should be in defense position to protect you from taking damage. Battle position can be changed manually once per turn for each monster, during your Main Phase. You cannot change its battle position if it was summoned, was set, or had attacked during that turn.

, The activation of a card or effect will start a Chain Link. After it is activated, the other player can choose to chain a card to it, which will then become Chain Link 2. This continues until neither player responds to the chain, after which it resolves, starting with the most recent Chain Link. While a Chain is resolving, cards and effects cannot be activated.


For example: Player A activates “Torrential Tribute”, which becomes Chain Link 1. Player B responds by activating ""Seven Tools of the Bandit"" to negate it by paying 1000 Life Points. He pays the LP now because that is a cost to activate the card, and happens during the activation and not the resolution. Player A passes on chaining more cards, and so does Player B, so now the chain resolves. Resolution begins with the most recent Chain Link - ""Seven Tools"". Seven Tools negates “Torrential Tribute”, so it does not destroy any monsters.

, Quick Effects will be designated either by saying they are a Quick Effect or by being able to be activated during either player's/your opponent's turn. These are also the only type of cards that can be played outside the Main Phase of your turn. Quick-Play Spells can only be played during your opponent’s turn if set the previous turn. If a Counter Trap Card is activated, the only cards that can be chained to it are other Counter Trap Cards.

, To play Yu-Gi-Oh, you must have a deck. The number of cards in a deck must be greater than or equal to 40 cards and less than or equal to 60 cards. It is usually better to have closer to 40 cards in your deck. Your deck should have a good balance of spells, traps, and monsters. A good ratio is 15-20 monsters, around 9-12 spells, and around 8-10 traps. These numbers will vary depending on your strategy. Most of the monsters should be below Level 4, with only about 1-4 (if any) of the higher levels that can’t be summoned any other way. The spells and trap cards should cover for the weaknesses of your deck, and you should have a handful of each of the following: attack protection, effect negation, summon negation, spell/trap destruction. Of course, these numbers are not absolute and will vary depending on your deck, so use what works for you. Your deck will be more consistent if it focuses around a single central archetype or theme.


An Extra Deck is not necessary for a duel, but is recommended for most decks. Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz monsters are placed in the Extra Deck instead of the Main Deck. You can look through your Extra Deck at any time during the duel, and you can special summon monsters from it during your turn. There is a maximum of 15 cards that can be in the Extra Deck. Your opponent cannot view your Extra Deck, except with an effect.
The Side Deck is also limited to 15 cards. It is optional, and is good for matches in tournaments. A match is a set of three duels, in which the player who wins two out of three is the winner. A Side Deck contains cards to be used against specific decks that are common or pose a major threat to your deck, but are too situational to put into your main deck. It is not to be used during a duel, but you can swap cards between it and the main and/or extra deck between the duels in a match. After siding, the number of cards in your Side deck must be the same as what you started with.
You can only have three copies of a single card in your Main, Extra, and Side decks combined. Certain cards are banned or limited for use in tournaments, so make sure your deck is legal if you are going to participate in them.

, To start a duel, find someone else to duel with. Shuffle each other’s decks and decide who goes first. This can be done by playing rock-paper-scissors, flipping a coin, or some other suitable method. The player going first cannot draw or attack. Decks that like to set up a field early or use effects that prevent themselves from battling will find it more advantageous to go first, while decks that need extra hand advantage to start their plays or respond to what the opponent does will prefer to go second. Both players start the game with 8000 Life Points.

, Place your Extra deck at the left of the bottom row, and your deck at the right, with space for five cards in between. These five spaces will be your Spell/Trap zones. Above your deck and extra deck will be your left and right Pendulum zones. The top row will contain the Field Spell zone (on the left) and the Graveyard (on the right). The five spaces in between these will be your monster zones. The banish zone is usually to the right of the graveyard.

, Both players draw 5 cards at the beginning of the game as their starting hand.


Your hand is revealed to you and not your opponent. They can only look at your hand through a card effect. It is important to keep your opponent from seeing your hand and learning about your strategies. During the End Phase, if you have more than 6 cards in your hand, you must discard until you have 6.

, You draw a card from your deck at the beginning of your turn, during the Draw Phase. The player who goes first can't draw.

, Certain effects activate during the Standby Phase. Otherwise, just ignore it.

, The Main Phase is the most important part of the turn, being the phase in which you will take most of your actions. In this phase, monsters can be summoned, effects can be activated, a monster’s battle position can be manually changed, and spells and traps can be activated or set.

, You can attack using Attack Position monsters you control during the Battle Phase. Entering the Battle Phase is optional. If you do not enter the Battle Phase, you move on to the End Phase and you do not enter Main Phase 2. The player who goes first cannot conduct the Battle Phase.

, After Battle Phase, you enter Main Phase 2. In this phase, the same actions as in Main Phase 1 can be performed, except you cannot change the battle position of a card that attacked during the Battle Phase. You cannot enter this phase if you have not entered the Battle Phase.

, The End Phase is the end of your turn. Certain effects may activate in this phase. After this, it becomes the next player’s turn.

, Once a player’s Life Points reach zero, they lose the duel. If a player would draw a card but cannot because they have no more cards in their deck, they also lose the duel. Players can also win or lose by card effect.

, Crow"" also to remove the third DARK monster in your opponent's Graveyard. This will slow them down in the attempt to Summon the infamous ""Dark Armed Dragon"".

, This will prevent the Summoning of ""Judgment Dragon"". This can possibly give you another turn to start a counter attack.

, Now of course ""D.D. Crow"" isn't just limited to removing monsters. You can also:


Remove your opponent's Spell and Trap Cards as well, stopping cards like ""Magical Stone Excavation"", ""Mask of Darkness"", and ""Spell Reproduction"" dead in their tracks.
If the card has a cost to activate it, your opponent will still have to pay it and get nothing back as a result giving you more of a field/hand advantage.
Its effect, ironically, can also help the Summon and activate the effect of the aforementioned ""Dark Armed Dragon"", since it is also a DARK monster and can contribute to the three DARK monsters in your Graveyard required to Special Summon it.

, As you can tell, ""D.D. Crow"" is a very flexible card and can be quite deadly and annoying when used correctly. With all these examples of stopping cards from either being summoned or being able to resolve their effects, there is no reason why ""D.D. Crow"" shouldn't be at least a Side Deck in your most competitive Deck.

If you do this, be sure to slide it out when you are done., Plain scotch tape will do for this, but you can also use colored washi tape to make your blow gun look more interesting., You don't have to wrap the tape around the tube this time. Just place short strips of tape between the middle and end pieces of tape. This will hold the flaps down.

, This will protect the paper and keep it from getting ruined. Wrap a piece of tape around the end of the tube so that the tape is sticking out slightly. Tuck the tape back into the tube, and press it against the walls. If your tube is very small, you may have to use a pen or pencil to do this.

, The rectangles need to be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide and 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) long.Each piece of paper will make one dart. You can make as many darts as you want.

, You can use a sharpened pencil to help curve the paper as you go. Don't worry if the dart looks like it will be too wide at the end. You will fix that in a moment.

, Use clear tape for this, so that you can see the paper. This is your dart.

, Do not force the dart into the dart. If it falls through the blowgun easily, you are ready to go. If it won't fit all the way into the blowgun, make a mark on the dart where the blowgun touches it. You can use a pen or pencil to do this., If the dart fell through the blowgun, then you can skip this step. If the dart was too big and you had to make a mark, simply cut the dart in half using the mark as a guide.


Your dart may start to come undone after you cut it. If that happens, simply wrap more tape around it.

, Paper darts can hurt if you fire them at someone. Toothpick darts will hurt even more. Never fire toothpick darts at another person or animal. You can fire them at balloons and other targets, however. Here is what you need to do:


Trim the tip of the dart until you get a hole big enough for you to slide a toothpick into.Push a toothpick into the hole until about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) is sticking out.
Wrap some tape around the tip of the dart to hold the toothpick in place.
Cut or break off any extra toothpick that is sticking out of the open/wider end of the dart.

, Push the dart into the mouth part of the blowgun, pointy part first. Hold the blowgun up to your lips, and point it at your target. Give the blowgun a sharp, quick blow.

Select a deck.,

Take a single card of your deck and place the card down to make individual rows.,

Place single cards on top of each row until you run out of cards.,

Pick up each row and stack them up in any way you like.,

Hand your opponent your deck so they can cut your deck.,

Move your deck to your side of the table.",How to Shuffle Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Cards1," This is also the only time you can make deck edits, so be sure to do them before progressing to next step.
, Make at anywhere between 5-10 rows.

Placing it in your card zones is one of the best places to put it down, because it gives you a set place to put a card down, and easy to repeat.

, Be sure to do this quickly, remember you are on a timer in a tournament, It does not matter what way you pick them up, or if you place each row on top, or each row on bottom, If you do not follow this step, it's grounds for an immediate loss or disqualification.

To cut means to split your cards in half and place the bottom half on top.

, Do not rearrange any more cards or shuffle again, or else your opponent must cut your deck again."

Plan ahead.,
Know the when and where.,
Bring what you need to play.,
Remember handy items to have.,
The night before be sure to get good rest.,
Take a shower and brush your teeth.,
Eat a good breakfast.,
Leave at a reasonable time to get to the tournament.",How to Prepare for a Yu Gi Oh! Tournament," Know the game, know your rules and know your deck. If you don't know what you are doing you won't get very far in the tournament and it will be a frustrating experience. ;
, Know when the tournament is and how to get there. Some tournaments are small local events, some are larger regional or national events with thousands of players. Also consider the format and make sure the deck you are using fits that format.

, Using a backpack can help you carry all your items. Keep it where you can see it at all times.


A 40 to 60 card deck
Something to keep track of your life points (calculator or pen and paper)
Tokens, dice or coins if your deck requires them.
Trade binder (optional)

, These will help you keep your focus for the entire tournament especially if it is a large event.


Cell phone (In case of an emergency or need to call someone for any reason)
Snacks and water (keep these away from people's cards)
A book or something to entertain you between matches
Tylenol and Pepto (or any other medicine you may need) are good to keep on hand. Most the time you won't need them but if you do you will be very happy to have them.
Luggage locks are great for keeping your stuff safe in your bag.

, Try to go to sleep when you normally would. Forcing yourself to go to sleep usually won't help. Basically don't stay up all night.

, No one wants to hang around someone that smells like a locker room.

, If you don't normally eat breakfast or a large breakfast go with something small. Eating a huge breakfast when your body isn't used to it will just give you a huge stomachache.

, Latecomers are sometimes turned away, especially at regional and pre-release events.

First find the method that suits how you like to play the game( increasing your opponents draw, stall, and destroying their deck), for example if you like to sit back and watch as the other player is unable to do anything, stalling is for you.,
Now that you have picked the way in which you will mill the other players deck you have two main choices on how to build the basis of your deck.,
Now that you have picked how you will mill other players decks and how your deck will do that, its time to start building your deck.,
First narrow your list of cards down to about 30 cards, no more than 34, and no less than 25.,
After step 4, if you are aiming for a 40 card deck, you should have about 10 cards left to add.,
Now it's time to play test your deck.If you are using stall, you should run against another deck to see how long you can survive.,
Now that you have test played your deck you can take out the cards that don't work in your deck, and add other cards that will work better.

,
Repeat steps 4,5,6,and 7as many times as needed to make your deck work the way you want it to.,
Now that you have your main deck it's time to make a side deck.,
Play games with about 5 different types of decks to see what doesn't work in your deck(much like in step 6 but a real game not just to see how long you can live, or how many cards you can mill in so many terns).

,
Again, after playing those 5 or so games, take out the cards that don't work, and add other cards that will work better.

,
Repeat steps 10 and 11 until you are pleased with your deck.

",How to Make a Yu Gi Oh Mill Deck," In the tips section I will add a link to a list of mill cards, a few deck ideas, and a few more helpful hints.;
, Find cards that mill your opponents deck, and find the best way to turn that into a deck. Or you can make a combo that mills cards, and then build your deck around getting that combo on the field, and keeping it there.

, But before you continue, consider how you will deal with decks that play into being milled, like Primordial Sun decks, or Lightsworn decks. or direct damage decks, which will thrive on a lack of offence on your part. So unless you get clever with the way you choose to mill the other player, you will most likely counter these decks using your support cards, which i will talk about later

, The way you do this is up to you, but for best results you should have 3 copies of about 10 different cards, but depending on your strategy, you might need 1 copy of 30 different cards, or 1 copy of some and multiple copies of others. If you plan on using an extra deck, now would be a good time to find the cards that will go into it, and at any point when you change your main deck you can change the cards that are in here too.

, These last 10 cards will be support cards. Support cards are anything that will keep you live long enough to win the game, and depending on the type of deck you have, the cards picked in step 4 might be support cards themselves, for example if you are making a stall deck all or most of the cards will be support already. If this is the case, you can add another 10 cards to that list and call it good. If that is not the case, add 10 support cards that fit the type of deck you are making. For example, if your deck is monster heavy put cards that add conditions to attacking, like having to mill cards to attack. If your deck is monster light put cards that will wipe the field of all monsters, and or stop attacks altogether.

, If you are using one of the other methods, you can test play by seeing how many cards you can mill in a certain number of terns.

,,(by now you should be able to survive 15-20 terns, or mill 20+ cards by tern 7)

, a side deck is not needed, but if you plan on playing in tournaments its best to have one, so you can customize your deck to better fit who you are playing. What goes in the side deck is largely up to you, but its best to have about 5 support cards, and about 10 cards that didn't quite make to cut for your main deck.

Look at the bottom right part of the card.,
Look on the bottom right hand corner on the back there should be a ™ sign.,
Inspect the back of the card.,
Feel the card, if it feels waxy it's probably fake.

Examine the cards for any giveaways -- (they may say they are fake right on them).

Some cards might have a shiny coat that makes a kind of sparkle and can only be removed if you rip the card.,

There is also a Japanese character to represent the Attribute in the top right hand corner.,
One of the most common fake cards you will see is Exodia.,

",How to Make Sure You're Buying Real Yu Gi Oh! Cards," If it says Copyright to the left of the shiny square then the card is fake.;
, If that is blurred then the card is fake.

, On the back next to the Konami sign there should be a small ®, if this is blurred then the card is fake.

,,, If this feature is on a card, it will always be a fake. (EDIT: This is not actually always the case. There are card rarities known as Parallel Rare. They feature this coating over the entire card. The sparkles can be rubbed off with excess handling, but the film will remain. Many fakes do in fact employ this effect to make a card appear rare, however, the only real cards that have this feature are certain video game promo cards, so if you encounter something that is supposed to be out of a pack, or is any other way represented as not one of those promos, then it will be fake. Use all of these steps together when evaluating a card, as this step alone is not guaranteed to weed out all fakes, and may weed out some real cards.)

, logo at the bottom-right.


If it doesn't have this it means they are fake.

, If it is not solid or is slightly faded, they are most likely fake. Also, the backs shouldn't be different colors unless they are god cards; Obelisk is blue, Ra is yellow, and Slifer is red.

, If the card has a different name than the original cards then it is most likely a fake card

, in it. Silver squares represent unlimited edition, and gold represents 1st edition//limited edition. Below the lower left-hand corner of the card image and the upper left-hand corner of the card lore area, if it says 1st edition or limited edition, then it should have a gold hologram in the lower right-hand corner of the card. If there is no writing in that area, then it will have the silver hologram. Note: Look closely at this hologram, as it should have Yu-Gi-Oh! in it as well as an eye of Anubis sign. If it is just a reflective piece of silver or gold, then it is fake. Be sure to look at it from different angles, as sometimes those little images aren't visible from one or more angles, depending on the lighting. If the box is not there or is not exactly in the corner it is fake. Note: It is possible that, as a production defect, the printing press was misaligned and the hologram could be askew, or even partially off the edge of the card. Also, the hologram may be the wrong color (silver instead of gold, or vice versa). However, this is very rare, so follow this step closely in conjunction with the others. If the card is real but has one of these defects, it is not a misprint but a manufacturing defect, and adds no value to the card, other than to an avid collector, so do not let someone talk you into an uneven trade based on a claim that it is worth a lot.

, If it doesn't look exactly the same it is fake. If it's shiny look at the shiny parts, see if the shiny part is circles everywhere then it's a fake. (EDIT: The card rarity Prismatic Secret Rare does in fact have the dots in the holofoil for the writing. However, this is also coupled with a special perpendicular holofoil effect. Normally, the lines in the image of a secret rare are diagonal and parallel, and the card name is printed in silver writing. However, in Prismatic secret rare, the lines in the image are straight up and down and left to right, making an effect that looks like boxes, or plaid. However, this effect is only present on certain video game promo cards. The newer video games have normal super rare cards, rather than this prismatic secret rare, so any card with that effect is going to be old. You may want to look on yugioh.wikia for a list of some of the video game promo cards that have been released in this rarity, because this is also a technique scammers use to make fake cards look real.)

, In newer packs there is a rarity known as ghost rare. You should google an image of such a card, to see what they look like. Their pictures are almost completely without color, or have only two colors and are very washed out. These are very rare and very valuable, but that also makes them a target for scammers trying to trade fakes. Generally if a card has an odd image, it is fake. Sometimes the words will not be grammatically correct, this is a dead give away.

, If it doesn't have this it is most likely a fake. Remember though some cards may not have this so check with guides online.

, If there is any strange wording or misspelled words, or the font is different from a normal card, it is a fake.

, If it is not there it is most likely fake.

, There are a lot of fakes of Exodia on the market because newbie players don't know any better, and are likely to buy or trade for them, thinking they are getting a good card. ""Exodia the Forbidden One"" features only the head of Exodia, and part of his shoulders, and has 1000 Atk/Def. Then, each of his limbs is a separate card, making a total of five cards to a set. Any ""Exodia the forbidden one"" or just ""exodia"" that has a picture of the entire assembled Exodia is fake. If it is coming out of the frame of the image area, it is fake. Often, these will have Atk/Def listed as infinity, or other insanely large numbers. There are cards, like exodius the ultimate forbidden lord and exodia necros that look similar to exodia, but they are very different. Educate yourself on Exodia and its similar partner cards, so that you don't fall victim to this common trick.

Get the Neo Spacians.,
Add other monsters.,
Get the fusions.,
Include support cards.,
Use staples.,
Pendulum variant: One of the problems with the Neos deck is that you have to summon all the materials for a contact fusion.",How to Make a Neos Yu Gi Oh! Deck," Using too many of them may clog your deck, so only use a few copies of the better ones. Use 1-2 Air Hummingbird, Dark Panther, Aqua Dolphin, Flare Scarab, and/or Glow Moss, and 1 Grand Mole (because it's limited). Also include around 2 Elemental HERO Neos to make the fusions, or Neos Alius if using Pendulums or Gemini support cards. Use Cross Porter to search your Neo-Spacians and Neo Space Pathfinder to search Neo Space.;
, Elemental HERO Prisma is great for dumping Neos and copying its name, so you can fuse more easily. Use 2-3 copies of it. Mathematician can be used to dump Cross Porter and trigger its effect, as well as making Rank 3 Xyzs. Some Elemental HEROs can help too - Necroshade allows you to summon Neos from your hand, Shadow Mist can search the rest of the HEROs and Mask Change, Bubbleman special summons himself and Mask Changes into Acid, and Blazeman can dump Necroshade, Neos, and Shadow Mist. Summoner Monk can special summon Prisma and Shadow Mist and make Rank 4s.

, The best Neos fusions are Air Neos, Grand Neos, Dark Neos, Flare Neos, Storm Neos, Magma Neos, and maybe Glow Neos. Include the ones you have Neo-Spacians for. Magma Neos is hard to summon, so it is not recommended. If you use Necroshade, Elemental HERO Darkbright or Necroid Shaman can be used to dump it with Prisma. In addition, if you have the proper cards, use Elemental HERO and Masked HERO fusions, as well as Rank 3, 4 and 7 Xyz monsters.

, Since Contact Fusions require both monsters to be on the field, you will need ways to quickly special summon your monsters. Common Soul, Fake Hero, and Double Summon can help with this. Convert Contact is a great draw card for the archetype, and Miracle Contact is the best card they have access to. Both should be maxed out. Reinforcement of the Army searches Prisma, the majority of the HERO cards, Cross Porter, Pathfinder, and Aqua Dolphin. Space Gift is also great for drawing, but it can be hard to get enough Spacians on the field at a time. Neo Space and Instant Neo Space will keep your Neos fusions on the field after the effort you went through summoning them. Neo Space is more searchable. E - Emergency Call will search your HEROs, O - Oversoul will revive Neos, Contact Out can save your fusions from destruction or their own End Phase effect, and Wrath of Neos can be used with Neos or a Prisma copying its name to destroy the entire field.

, Cards that would help are Twin Twisters/MST, Raigeki, Soul Charge, Foolish Burial, Call of the Haunted, Oasis of Dragon Souls, and Reinforcement of the Army., Pendulums could help solve that problem by special summoning a bunch of monsters from your hand at once. Good Pendulum engines to use are Magicians (good search card, high enough scales to Pendulum Neos) and Igknights (good at deck thinning and searchable via RotA and Summoner's Art, but you can't Pendulum summon Neos). In a Pendulum deck, use less of the special summon cards and more draw, search, and revival cards."

This can involve burn, mill, an alternate win condition like Final Countdown, or just stalling long enough to use up your opponent's resources and summon powerful monsters you can win with.
, Sort them into monsters, spells, and traps. Note any cards that can help you negate attacks or damage, or that help with your strategy.

, You do not necessarily want ones with high defense, because it will be easy for most decks to get over it. Instead, use ones that can destroy opponent monsters, negate attacks, negate their own destruction, or prevent damage. Good ones are Marshmallon, Swift Scarecrow, or Spirit Reaper., Use cards that can negate the opponent's attacks, like Scrap-Iron Scarecrow, Threatening Roar, or Waboku. Also, use cards that prevent your opponent from attacking, like Swords of Revealing Light, Level Limit - Area B, Gravity Bind or Ordeal of a Traveler. Hand traps like Battle Fader, Swift Scarecrow, or Speedroid Menko and cards that end the battle phase are also good. You can also decrease their monsters' ATKs with effects like Burden of the Mighty or Half Shut., Use cards like Raigeki, Dark Hole, Lightning Vortex, or Lava Golem/Kaijus to preventing them from building up a powerful field and overwhelming your defense. Also, use attack response traps like Dimensional Prison, Mirror Force, and Quaking Mirror Force., These include cards like Mystical Space Typhoon, Twin Twister, Solemn Warning and Solemn Strike, Torrential Tribute, and Compulsory Evacuation Device., Use Xyz monsters you can summon, and a few synchro monsters if you have a tuner. This can get you out of tough situations or provide an alternate win condition for you."

, 1st Edition and Limited Edition cards will have a gold square, while Unlimited Edition cards will have a silver one. Having an incorrectly colored hologram or the lack of one is a clear indication that the card is fake.

, It should be noted however newer cards are glossier than older cards.

, If the font is too thin or too thick, or there are spelling mistakes, it may be fake. Note that Yu-Gi-Oh! uses a special font.

, If it is blurry or poor quality, it may be fake, however note that Duel Terminal cards have a parallel coat which may make the cards look blurred.

, However some boosters, like Gladiators Assault, have brighter colors and Duel Terminal cards have darker colors because of the parallel coat.

Use a pen that will work.,
Unscrew and open your pen.,
If the spring isn't attached to the ink cartridge, re-attach it.,
Insert the ink cartridge backwards into the ""click end"" of the pen.,
Tape one end of the rubber band to the ink cartridge.,
Pull back the rubber band.,
Let go of the rubber band to fire.",How to Build a Pen Gun," Not every pen can easily be converted into a rubber band-slinging cannon. Find a cheap ballpoint pen that uses a thumb-operated ""click"" mechanism to extend and retract the tip of the pen. You also should be able to unscrew the pen somewhere in its middle section for easy access to its contents.


Inside the pen, you should find an ink cartridge (usually clear plastic with a metal tip), a few plastic pieces that make up the ""click"" mechanism, and a small metal spring. When finished, the pen gun will launch a custom projectile made from the ink cartridge and an ordinary rubber band.;
, Remove the ink cartridge.The spring may cling to the plastic of the ink cartridge - if so, you may leave it. If not, look for it in the pen - if it is still in place at the tip of the writing end of the pen, shake it out or reach for it with some tweezers.








, Gently slide it over the tip of the pen up to the small ridge most ink cartridges have. The spring will provide extra mechanical power for launching your rubber band projectile.








, Insert the ink cartridge point-first. The ink cartridge should comfortably rest in the plastic housing of the ""click"" mechanism. When positioned correctly, the back end of the the ink cartridge should stick out of the pen.









Before inserting the ink cartridge, you may want to drop in a small rolled-up bit of paper. This can help secure the spring to the body of the pen.

, Using clear plastic tape, electrical tape, or duct tape, secure one end of a rubber band to the end of the ink cartridge that's sticking out of the pen. Make sure the rubber band is firmly stuck - if it falls off, you could misfire and snap yourself!








, Find a suitable target (never a person or animal) and pull the rubber band back to ready your projectile. Hold the rubber band parallel to the body of the ""gun"".








, The rubber band should snap forward, launching the ink cartridge towards your target. Best of all, the projectile is re-usable. Retrieve the ink cartridge, take aim, and fire again!

Add monster cards.,

Add trap cards.,
Build an Extra Deck.,

When building your deck, keep the metagame in mind.,
Once you've compiled your deck, test it out and learn the strengths and weaknesses of your deck.,
Have consistency.",How to Construct a Yu Gi Oh! Deck," cards. If you already have cards, lay them out so you can see them all and organize them easily. It's a good idea to have a lot of cards so you have some variety. If you don't think you have enough to work with, buy a tin or two. These offer a few cards from a lot of series to choose from. If you already have an idea of what you're looking for, you can buy singles online or at your local trading card store. Alternatively you may construct and test a deck with an online simulator, such as on the Dueling Book website (Dueling Network is down), before deciding to buy some cards.


You will need between 40 to 60 cards to make a full deck. Always have as close to 40 cards as possible to lessen the chance of getting bad draws.;
, Ensure you know the rules before you start. If you don't know the rules of Yu-Gi-Oh, you can find a rulebook and many tutorials online. If you do know the basic rules, familiarize yourself with the more complex mechanics, like chaining, missing the timing, and conjunctions.


, The best Yu-Gi-Oh! decks focus around a single archetype: a group of cards with similar names that support each other. An archetype deck will be much more powerful and consistent than a deck focused around an attribute or type, because of the synergy and support cards. A deck should also focus on a single mechanic or gimmick, like Synchro summoning or banishing.


Before you build your own deck, you might want to watch or play a few games with a friend's deck to help decide on what strategies you prefer. You can also find good decks to use on the internet.

, Monsters are the most important cards in Yu-Gi-Oh, used by almost every deck to attack and defend. Around 12-18 cards in your deck should be monsters, which should support your archetype or work with your deck. Don't have too many monsters you can't summon - the majority of your deck should be level 4 or below. Only use around 3-4 level 5 and 6 monsters, and 1-2 level 7 and up monsters, unless your high-level monsters are readily summonable. Use effect monsters with useful effects, unless your deck focuses on normal monsters.

, Most spell cards help you make your plays or get you out of tough spots. Good spells to use are: archetype support cards, searchers like Reinforcement of the Army or Preparation of Rites, monster destruction like Raigeki or Dark Hole, monster protection like Forbidden Lance, spell/trap destruction like Mystical Space Typhoon, and deck thinners like Upstart Goblin and Pot of Duality. Certain decks may also use field spells or ritual spells.

, Trap cards are useful for disrupting your opponent's plays. Most decks use around 5-10 traps, though some use as low as 3. Good trap cards are those that can: prevent attacks like Mirror Force, negate summons like Solemn Warning, negate spell/trap activations like Wiretap, negate effects like Breakthrough Skill or Fiendish Chain, remove monsters like Ring of Destruction or Compulsory Evacuation Device, and prevent your opponent from making plays like Vanity's Emptiness. You should use trap cards to shore up your deck's weaknesses.

, Nearly every deck in existence benefits from having an Extra Deck. If you have at least 3 summonable monsters of the same level, include some generic Xyz monsters of that rank. If you have a Tuner, add a few Synchro monsters who's levels equal the combined levels of that Tuner and you most commonly summoned monsters.

, A Side Deck is optional, and you will not need one unless you plan to participate in tournaments. You can switch in the cards in your side deck between duels in matches. A side deck is limited to 15 cards, and contains cards that are good against certain strategies, but are too situational to include in your main deck. If you want a side deck, build it to counter the decks you are likely to face, such as your friends' decks or the decks at your local tournament.

, Understand what cards are good at the time, and have strategies to counter the most popular decks and strategies.

, Now would be a good time to make any card swaps, and build your Side Deck.

, Consistency is essential. In order for you to draw the cards you need, you need to add copies of some cards.


The more copies of the same card you carry, the higher chance there is that you will draw it. This step relies on a smaller deck. 40 card decks has smaller amount of cards than 60 card decks. If you have a 40 card deck with three copies of a card, you have a 1/13 chance to draw into the card. This means that every 13 cards you should draw one copy of the card.
Combine this with cards that thin the deck from searching or special summoning along with drawing cards, and you may be carrying a deadly deck.

Make a coil with the copper wire around one of the two openings of the PVC pipe (wind the copper wire around said opening a hundred or two hundred times).,
Cut the PVC pipe on the opposite ends to make it about 6 inches (15.2 cm) thick.,
Make a ring out of the steel wire by twisting it with pliers and cutting it.,
Dismantle the camera.,
With the plywood, make a cast to fake the body design.,
Bend the metal and make a body out of that.,
You're ready to try it.",How to Make a Coilgun," Make the coil start on the border and end 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) from it (the coil would be 2-3 inches long). If it doesn't stay still, use glue to glue it in place while you coil it. Make it thick (half an inch is quite enough, but the larger the coil, the more powerful the projectile will be when fired). Be sure to leave the two copper wire ends of the coil easy to use and not insulated (while the rest of the coil should be insulated).






;
, Turn the coil on by hooking it up to a battery. Cut a piece of the steel wire. Put the steel next to the coil and see how far it can be while still attracting. Cut the PVC pipe at that distance.








, It should fit well inside the pvc pipe, but not too squeezed.








, Take out the flash circuit. IMPORTANT: There is a battery in this circuit. Take it out and don't touch any metal parts (especially the two ends of the capacitor). Then, touch the two ends of the capacitor with a screwdriver to discharge it. if there is a spark, then it was charged but now safe to touch, if not then it wasn't charged. This is to avoid getting shocked. When this has been done, find the capacitor, which would be a cylindrical thing, larger than most of the components in the circuit. Cut two more copper wires. Insulate the ends and attach them to each wire protruding from the capacitor. Attach the other end of one of these wires to one end of the coil's wires. The other two wires (the other capacitor wire and the other coil wire) will be connected whenever you turn on the coilgun. A fly zapper can also do the job well.








, then put the coil and the pvc and put a tube larger than it in. put the foam filler in the body cast and your set.








, then put the foam filler in so that the electrical parts won't touch the metal so that you won't get shocked and you're all set








, Put the battery you took out in the previous step back where it was. Find a sort of button in the middle of the flash circuit. Press it and wait a minute. After that, load your projectile (the steel ring) and connect the two wires left unconnected. There should be a spark, and the projectile should get shot. When you're done, take out the battery and touch any metal endings (especially those of the capacitor) with a screwdriver to release any charge.

Separate the clothespin pieces.,
Take one of your clothespin pieces and enlarge the spring hole.,
Expand the lip nearest to the narrow end of the other piece of wood.,
Carve out a barrel for the gun.,
Use a rubber band to hold the two pieces together.,
Reinstall the spring.,
Load the gun.,
Cock the gun.,
Pull the trigger.",How to Make a Clothespin Gun," Pull the pieces of wood apart slightly while moving one piece sideways. This will help pop the spring loose.


You can usually find wooden clothespins at any local grocery store. If wooden clothespins aren't available, plastic clothespins can also be used.;
, Use a utility knife to carve a centimeter or two of wood away between the spring hole and the pointed end of the wood.Carve until you have expanded the spring hole by about a half inch toward the pointed end of the clothespin.

, Find the first rounded indentation along the narrow end of the wood. Use your utility knife to cut away the wood from the curved corner closest to the spring hole until it is squared., Use your utility knife to carve a small channel from the spring hole to the pointed ends. It only needs to be a couple centimeters deep. Be sure it is center on the length of wood to create a straight canal on inside surface. Repeat this step on the other piece of wood. This will create a barrel for your gun so you can launch objects with more force since the wood won't be pressing against your ammo.

, Press the clothespin pieces back together so that both thick ends are on one side, and the thin ends are on the other. The flat surface of the clothespin pieces should be facing each other.


Wrap the rubber band around both pieces of wood several times. Rotate the remainder of the rubber band in your hand halfway around after each layer. Continue until the rubber band keeps the wood pieces together securely. You can add an additional rubber band around the barrel of the gun to make the gun sturdier if you want.
Alternatively, you can use wood or super glue. Apply glue to the flat surfaces of the clothespins. Squeeze the pieces together and wipe away any residue. Wait until the glue dries to proceed.

, Place one end of the spring into the front notch on the gun, and place the other end through the spring hole in between the pieces of wood. The coiled portion of the spring should be suspended just below the body of the gun. This will act as the trigger.

, Slide a matchstick or toothpick into the hole at the narrow end of the gun. Keep pushing it until you reach the spring.


You might want to break off the point on the side of the toothpick being loaded. The flatter surface will make it easier to push back the spring.

, Slide the toothpick or matchstick in until it pushes the spring back to the cocked position. Once the spring is secured in the back notch, your gun is ready to fire.


For additional excitement, try using a strike anywhere match as your ammo and see if you can get it to ignite. You can also light your match before firing and go to battle with flaming artillery. Just be careful and don't play with fire indoors or near anything flammable or explosive.
Warning: Be sure that no one is nearby when you select your target. You might think it's just a tiny piece of wood, but it could do some real damage if you accidentally hit someone in the eye.

, Use your index finger to pull back on the coiled spring and fire your artillery. The gun should be powerful enough to fire a toothpick or match up to 20 feet away. It can even penetrate the skin of apple."

Plan out the name of your trading card game.,

Come up with a unique background and story.,
Plan the game.,
Think of various types of cards.,
Come up with a good and relevant time period.,

Either print out the templates on card or paper, then get your artist to draw on them, or use a tablet to draw them on your computer.

Play it with your friends and have fun!

",How to Make a Trading Card Game," It has to be an interesting name so that people will want to play it. The name should be catchy and original, so people will want to play your game. (Don't use other card game names, like Yu-Gi-Oh! or Pokémon);
, Science fiction, space, fantasy, western, past, future, are a few examples.

, You should base the rules on the background and story, not the other way around. So this step must come before the rules

, Make a good set of rules and an exciting objective. The rules have to be balanced its not too easy its not too complicated. It's no fun playing a card game when there are no rules or too many rules to follow.


Many games have different rules. Some are strict whereas others can be looser. Experiment, and see what is right for you. When planning the game, you must come up with a good playing field. You might as well think of how turns will be lost or gained, how to win the game, and more.

, There definitely must be a very wide assortment of characters. Power-ups, bonuses and health are also several cards that can make a card game more interesting. You can also make ""rule-bending"" cards that change the rules.


This makes your card game more interesting. These cards may be grouped into types, elements, or classes if the creator desires. These cards must have graphics. Few people would like to play a card game by just looking at words on a card. Hire an artist if you need.

, It would have been a bit confusing if the creator of Yu-Gi-Oh! called his game ""A Time in Modern Rome"" for a time period. If your game has many different creatures from different time periods, this step is irrelevant.

, Photoshop is a recommended choice. Draw out your templates on the program, then write on the card the abilities, colour, attack power, name etc... You may also draw the cards by hand, but this is extremely time consuming.

Collect others' ATCs.",How to Make Artist Trading Cards," Artist trading cards are generally 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) by 3 1/2 inches. This allows them to fit into the plastic sleeves in which they are stored. You can then use the plastic card holders in a binder to bring to a trade and store in your own binder collection. This is the size of hockey cards and other trading cards. You can even start with mismatched playing cards as a base for collage or altered item artwork.
, A paper cutter, if you have one, will help you make square, straight cuts quickly., You may start by cutting cardstock or heavy paper to size. If you work in another medium, such as leather or fabric, you may either cut it to size or work so that the finished result is the correct size., If you can do it inside of 3.5 x 2.5 inches, you can make an ATC.

Drawing and painting are easily done at this size, but so are plenty of other arts, including quilting, photography, crochet, leather work, metal work, and collage.

, You don't need to be careless when making an ATC, but there's no need to work your masterpiece in miniature, either. ATCs should be simple pieces that you're willing to give away when you're done. It is suggested 15 minute per card so you will want to trade them., You'll need a selection of cards. Remember that you will be giving your cards away. ""Lots"" can be relative. It could be half a dozen or a few dozen, depending on how many you expect to trade., Is there a particular palette or medium you prefer or a technique you've been exploring lately?, An email address or website is a good compromise if you'll be giving these cards to strangers, or mailing them., The title is optional, but it will give your recipients or viewers a context in which to view your work. Or leave it to the the people trading, beauty is in the eye of the beholder., The whole point of ATCs is to trade with other artists, so once you have a selection of cards, trade them.
Find artists or groups in your area that trade cards. The idea is to trade in person.
Attend gatherings of artists in your area, and remind them to bring ATCs to share.
Carry them with you as you would business cards, so that if you find an occasion to trade or give away a card, they are with you.
Spread the word. If your local artist community is unfamiliar with artist trading cards, you might wish to give away a few cards or offer them with a request for one in return before you get many back.
Organize a gathering to swap ATCs. Let people know what ATCs are about, and get together to try trading some.
Look on-line. There are on-line groups that will match you up with others the world over who can mail cards in exchange for yours.

, Because they are the size of other standard trading cards, most will fit in trading card sleeves. ATCs should be as unique as the artists who create them, so enjoy the selection. Start a collection of ATCs and try to get as many as you can."

Use a ruler to mark off six 5-inch sections of pipe with a black marker.,
Cut at the other marks you made to produce the required six 5-inch pieces and one 8-inch piece.

,
Get the two elbow-bend connectors, two T-shaped connectors, and two end caps.

,
Take the 8-inch piece and insert it into one of the two horizontal ends of one T-shaped connector.

,
Put one 5-inch piece in the other horizontal end of the same T-shaped connector.

,
Insert another 5-inch piece into the third opening of the connector.,
Go back to the first short piece you put in (the horizontal one) and put the other T-shaped connector on the other end, this time with the third connector facing up (so it looks like an upside-down T).

,
Insert a 5-inch piece into each opening of the connector.

,
Put an elbow connector on both pipes that you just put in.,
Insert the remaining two 5-inch pieces into the elbow connectors and put a cap on the end of the vertical one.

To fire the gun, first take a mini marshmallow and place it gently in the opening of the only uncapped small pipe (the one on top of the gun).",How to Make a Marshmallow Gun," Then mark off one 8-inch section of pipe and cut the pipe at that mark, leaving you with one 38-inch piece. It's just easier to work with a shorter pipe.;
,,,,, Put a cap on the other end of this piece; this is one of the handles of your gun.

,,, The connector on the vertical pipe should face away from the 8-inch piece; the connector on the horizontal pipe should face down.

,, Diluting white glue with water will result in a clear-drying liquid perfect for decoupage. This mixture can also be used as a varnish/sealant to keep marker ink from rubbing off, paint from flaking off, stickers from falling off, et cetera. If you've got enough cash to spare, colorful electrical tape works beautifully, though the cost of one little roll tends to be a bit steep.

, Take a deep breath and blow into the opening that you just put a marshmallow into. Your confection should shoot out of the barrel (the 8"" piece). If it doesn't, try blowing again. It might've gotten stuck.

Hold the deck of cards loosely between your left thumb and fingers.,
Angle the cards slightly.,
Fan the cards with your right thumb.,
Practice.,
Flick up your left wrist as you thumb with your right.,
Practice the one-handed close.",How to Fan Cards1," Put your left hand out as though you were holding a cup of water, with your thumb nearest you. Place the deck of cards in between your thumb and index finger, keeping it flat with the face side down. Place your index and middle finger against the underside of the deck. The tip of your middle finger should be against the near right corner of the deck, with your index finger alongside it. Loosely hold the deck by placing your thumb across the top of the deck, with the tip about halfway across the nearest edge.Being left-handed or right-handed doesn't make too much of a difference, but you can try using your right hand instead if you keep dropping the cards.;
, Shift the top of the deck slightly, so the top cards are very slightly more to the right than the cards beneath them. This small angle helps the cards fan out more evenly, although this step becomes less important with practice.







, Bring your right thumb onto the left edge of the deck, and use it to push the cards into a fan shape, pivoting around your left thumb. Press down slightly with your thumb as you do this, but keep it gentle enough that the cards spread out in an even fan instead of clumping together in chunks. Ideally, you should finish the fan with the cards spread out in a full 180º semicircle.









You can use your right fingers instead of your thumb.You can think of this movement as pulling the stack of cards away from the bottom-most card in turn. If the entire deck moves together, hold it more loosely, or try consciously moving your right thumb at an upward angle as you spread

, Magicians make fanning cards look easy, but they've put in many hours of practice. Keep practicing until you can fan the cards smoothly and evenly. Speed up your fan as you become more experienced, but don't become so fast that you ruin the grace and fluidity of the fan.









Replace your deck if the cards become more difficult to fan. Worn cards may not spread as evenly.

, Try this advanced technique to increase the speed at which the cards fan out. With this wrist flick upwards, as you are pulling the cards down with your thumb, you are simultaneously pulling the cards up with your left hand.








, It's easy to close the fan again with your free hand, moving the cards in the same direction as the fan to put them back into one stack. For a more advanced technique, practice using the fingers holding the cards to pull them closed instead. You may need to ""walk"" your fingers a few times along the underside of the cards to manage this, and it can take a fair amount of practice before you can do this confidently and without dropping cards.

If your Exodia pieces are getting banished often, you may consider adding a card to retrieve them.,You can fill in the rest of your deck with whatever you want, but recommended cards are ""Deep Diver"", ""Jar of Greed"", ""Legacy of Yata-Garasu"", 3 ""Toon Table of Contents"", ""Monster Reincarnation"", ""Magical Stone Excavation"" and ""A Feather of the Phoenix""

",How to Build an Exodia Deck," Each one is Limited to 1 per deck.;
,, Emissary of the Afterlife, Where Arf Thou?, Legion the Fiend Jester, and Blue Dragon Summoner can search the limbs, and Deep Diver, Vampire Dragon, and Lavalval Chain can search all pieces, including the head.

, Upstart Goblin, Pot of Duality, Dark World Dealings, Reckless Greed, One Day of Peace, Reload, and Magical Mallet are all helpful. Do not use Pot of Greed, as it is forbidden.

, These help get cards out of your deck so it is easier to draw Exodia. Use three copies of Thunder Dragon or Toon Table of Contents to search themselves.

, This will protect your life points, as well as your monsters

, Otherwise, if your opponent manages to discard one, you will be unable to win. Good cards are Jar of Avarice, Monster Reincarnation, Dark Eruption, Backup Soldier, and Dark Factory of Mass Production. The latter two only work on the limbs. Don't use too many of these; you priority should be getting the Exodia pieces before your opponent can do anything.

, Trance Archfiend, Dimensional Alchemist, and Necroface are good for this.

Try this with half a deck first.,
Grip the deck in your dominant hand.,
Lift your thumb and tilt the deck outward.,
Place your thumb against the lower left corner, moving your other fingers.,
Spread your thumb and fingers in opposite directions.,
Misdirect the audience.",How to Fan Cards2," This fan is most easily done with approximately half the playing card deck, although it can be done with a whole deck with practice. Practicing with half a deck is recommended.This fan is more difficult than the two-handed fan, and some familiarity with that method may be useful.
Once you are an expert at this fan, try dividing a deck in two and fanning each half with a different hand, simultaneously.

, Square the cards together in a neat stack. Hold the deck with your first and fifth fingers on opposite long edges. Put your third and fourth fingers along one short edge, and your thumb on the remaining short edge. Each finger should cover the entire width of the deck and protrude slightly beyond it.Turn your hand so the deck is held vertically, with the thumb along the upper edge.


This grip should be secure enough that you can lift your thumb and rotate the deck in any direction without spilling cards.
You can skip straight to the position described below, with your thumb in the lower left corner. However, this is a good starting position to practice from if you plan on learning more advanced card tricks and flourishes.

, Remove your thumb from the upper edge. Tilt the deck outward, away from you, and curl up your third and fourth fingers to grip the bottom edge.








, This is the lower left corner of the top surface of the deck, nearest to you. Once your thumb is in position, move your first and fifth fingers away from the sides and down to the lower edge, so all four finger are supporting the deck from below. This can take a little practice to time the movement of your first finger, so as not to drop the cards.









Depending on the length of your thumb, you may prefer to place your thumb along the left edge of the top card instead, less than an inch (2.5 cm) from the lower corner.Placing your thumb nearer the center of the top card is a common mistake, so concentrate.
If you are holding the deck in your left hand, instead place the thumb against the lower right corner.

, Fan the cards by moving your thumb clockwise, while you move all four fingers counterclockwise, in the opposite direction. (Reverse these directions for a deck in your left hand.) A fast spread will make the cards fan more smoothly.








You can think of this motion as ""snapping"" all four fingers against your thumb.At the end of the fan, the fleshy part of your hand beneath your thumb will help support the fanned-out cards.

, Once you've got this motion down, practice some sleight of hand while using it in your tricks:








Secretly removing the top half of the deck before fanning still results in a fan that looks like a full deck, and will prevent an audience member from picking the top card.
Hold the card fan vertically, directly in front of the audience member's face. This will distract him while your other hand performs an manipulations necessary with the other half of the deck.

Choose the cards you want to craft.,
Click the card you want to craft.",How to Craft Cards in Hearthstone3," Different cards require different amounts of arcane dust to craft. The higher the rarity of the card you are trying to craft the more arcane dust you will need to craft it. If you have a particular card in mind you want to craft, but do not have enough dust to create it, you will need to disenchant more of your cards until you have enough dust.

Keep in mind that when you craft cards of high rarity, you will be sacrificing many other cards into to craft. Make sure you don’t accidentally disenchant too many cards and leave yourself with nothing to put in your deck to complement your newly-crafted legendary card.

, A menu will pop up that will show much arcane dust it requires to craft. If you already have that card in your collection you will also be able to disenchant it from this menu. Click “Create” and the card will be added to your collection, allowing you to add it to your decks."
"
Lay all your cards out on a table or in a binder where you can see them all easily.,
Decide on a theme.,
Go through your entire collection (this might take a while if you're like me) and take out every card that would be even REMOTELY helpful to your deck.,
Find several staple cards such as Trap Hole, Sakuretsu Armor, Mystical Space Typhoon, and Pot of Greed.

,
Go through your pile of ""maybes"" and select 20-22 monster cards.,
Find the spells and traps you want for your deck now.,
Have no more than 40-45 cards in your main deck.,
If you have an extra deck, keep as many cards as you possibly can in there.,
Put cards like creature swap in your deck that will allow you to use your opponent's cards against them.,
Play cards like Gravekeeper's Servant that will send their cards to the graveyard directly from their deck.,
Come up with creative strategies that will surprise your opponent.,
As you get to know your deck switch cards that don't work so well out for better ones.",How to Duel Like a Yu Gi Oh! Beast,";
, Popular decks can be based on character decks from anime and manga; warrior decks are also popular. You should be informed about the meta decks right now, know their strategies and make a deck to counter the popular ones.], Even if you don't think it would be good, it might work with something you find later.

,, Try to have more effect monsters than normal monsters. All but 2 or 3 of these cards should be level 4 or lower. Add some flip effect monster to add an element of surprise to your dueling. I like to include two level 5-6 monsters and one level 7+ monster. If you are going to add a god card or a similar 3 tribute monster you may want to consider not having any other tribute monsters.

, you want about half of these to be the staples I discussed earlier, and the rest cards to aid your deck in particular. Try to include about 13 spells and 7 traps, or something close to that ratio.

, loading down your deck with too many cards is your number one ticket to being a sucky duelist.

, Even if it's super hard to fusion or synchro summon a monster, you never know what you'll draw.

, There's nothing worse than summoning your best monster and being forced to swap it out with your opponent's Quillbolt Hedgehog.

, This is another good way to win, because your opponent loses if their deck runs out of cards.

, De-Synchro and De-Fusion are great to use on your opponent, but what could you do if you played them on your own monsters? There's no better way to blow away an opponent than by surprising them with amazing strategy.

, There's always room for improvement.

Get the Saga of Blue-Eyes White Dragon structure deck.,
Get the new support from Shining Victories.,
Get the important monsters.,
Add spells.,
Add staples.,
Build the Extra Deck.,
Try the Chaos Variant: You can also play a variant of Blue-Eyes that makes use of the Chaos cards.,
Try the Hieratic Variant: Include an engine with cards like Tefnuit, Nuit, Su, Eset, Labradorite Dragon, and Hieratic Seal of Convocation.,
Try Dragon Master Knight: A boss fusion monster created by Kaiba and Yugi's ace monsters, Dragon Master Knight is hard to summon but really cool when you pull it off.,
Try Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon: This is the new card Kaiba came up with in the Pyramid of Light movie.",How to Build a Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Blue Eyes Deck," It contains many of the cards you need. Three copies are recommended.

The good cards are: Blue-Eyes, Maiden, White Stone, Honest, Dragon Shrine, Silver's Cry, Trade-In, Cards of Consonance, One for One, Call of the Haunted, Rider of the Storm Winds, Darkstorm Dragon, and Azure-Eyes.;
, White Stone of Ancients, Sage with Eyes of Blue, Dragon Spirit of White, and Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon are must-haves. Master with Eyes of Blue, Protector with Eyes of Blue, Mausoleum of White, and Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon are good to have a few copies of., You need 3 copies each of Blue-Eyes, White Stone of Ancients, Sage, and Maiden, as well as around 2 Dragon Spirit of White, White Stone of Legend, and Effect Veiler. Other useful monsters are Master, Protector, Glow-Up Bulb, Mausoleum of White, and Keeper of the Shrine., The Blue-Eyes deck relies a lot on its spells. You will need 3 copies of Silver's Cry, Dragon Shrine, Melody of Awakening Dragon, and 2-3 Trade-In. You can also use 2-3 Cards of Consonance, along with 3 each of the White Stones. If you use enough Maiden and Sage, Mausoleum is a good addition, along with Terraforming. 1-2 Beacon of White can help OTK., 3 Twin Twisters (or MST), 1 Soul Charge, and 1 One for One. Maybe 2-3 Maxx C and 1-2 Solemn Strike.,

Synchros: If you have Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon, a good number of your extra deck slots will be dedicated to its effect, which tributes itself to summon a Light Dragon Synchro monster. Get 2-3 Spirit and 2 Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon, 1 Stardust Spark, 1 Black Rose Moonlight Dragon, and 1 Michael the Arch-Lightsworn. Crystal-Wing Synchro Dragon is a good addition because you can summon it by turning Spirit into a Level 7 Synchro and tuning it with a Level 1. You can also add Cloudcastle to revive used Azure-Eyes and make Phantom Fortress Enterblathnir.
Xyz: Blue-Eyes can make Rank 8 Xyzs like no other deck. Get Hope Harbinger, Felgrand, Lancelot, and Alsei. If you can get Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter or Galaxy-Eyes Full Armored, use them with Tachyon. Other good cards include Heliopolis, Aegaion, and Giant Grinder.
Fusions: Twin Burst can be summoned easily without needing a fusion card. If you include a fusion card, like Dragon's Mirror, you can summon First of the Dragons, Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon, and Five-Headed Dragon.

, Include cards like Black Luster Soldier - Envoy, Dark Armed Dragon, Lightpulsar and Darkflare, Wyverburster and Collapserpent, Eclipse Wyvern, and Chaos Sorcerer. Also run mill cards like Raiden and Lyla, Kuribandit, and Card Trooper., Use cards like Hieratic Dragon King of Atum, Gaia Dragon, other Rank 6s, and whatever Synchros you can make in your Extra Deck., A deck built around it can be rather inconsistent, however. Use cards like Elemental Hero Prisma, Fusion Tag, and King of the Swamp to replace the fusion materials, as well as Black Luster Soldier (the original), Polymerization, and Dragon's Mirror. You can also add cards like Burst Stream of Destruction (to use with Prisma), Emergency Call, and Pre-Preparation of Rites + Black Luster Ritual to search Black Luster Soldier., It has a rather underwhelming effect and a ridiculously hard summoning condition, but you can build a fairly good deck around it, and it will be pretty cool when you summon it. Use the fusion replacement and support cards from the Dragon Master Knight build, and Melody of Awakening Dragon for searching Shining."

Start from the top of the game.,
Decide if you want to open them.,
Find a special place to put your trading cards like a shoe box, your closet, a jewelry box, a scrap-book or a binder.,
Try to get Yu-Gi-Oh!,
Keep your cards neat and organized so they don't get mixed up.,
Try to trade your spare cards for the ones you don't have or you want, or maybe you can try selling them, and buy new ones with the money!

",How to Collect Yu Gi Oh! Cards," Never buy trading cards out of order. If you do, you will get confused. Always buy trading cards in the first order; for example: the first edition/season and the second edition/season then you go up and up.;
, You may not want to open them because they can be worth some money and will be more valuable if you haven't opened them. Make sure you don't get them damaged - that will decrease their value by a lot.


This will be a little hard, but Yu-Gi-Oh! trading cards are not expensive, so whatever age you are trying to collect trading cards this is for you.

, You can get binders from game shops that are designed to hold trading cards. Put more valuable ones in sleeves to protect them from damage.

, cards every week or month, but stick to your budget! If you're young, make a deal with your parents about how much you can spend.

, Have a system of sorting them. Most people sort by set number, which is a mix of letters and numbers that can be found at the bottom of the art and above the text. An example is SHVI-EN047. SHVI is the set, Shining Victories, EN is English language, and 47 is the number in the set list.

Decide what kind of deck you want to build.,
Get the monsters.,
Put in draw and search cards to help you gain advantage and get to your combo pieces faster.,
If you are playing fusions, add some fusion spells and support.,
If you play Masked HEROs, add 3 copies of Mask Change.,
Put in staple cards.,
Build an Extra deck.",How to Build an Elemental Hero Yu Gi Oh! GX Deck," There are many different variants of Elemental HEROs. Currently, the best build is Masked Heroes, which use Mask Change and Shadow Mist to bring out Dark Law. However, there are many other options, so feel free to just experiment with the cards until you figure out what works for you.;
, The best HERO monsters are Shadow Mist, Bubbleman, Neos Alius, Blazeman, and Prisma (for fusion decks). None of the others are really worth using, except for fusing with. Masked HERO decks also use a few copies of Summoner Monk and Goblindbergh to special summon Shadow Mist and trigger its effects. Typically, HERO decks use few monsters and many cards to search them., HEROs have access to some great searchers in Reinforcement of the Army, E - Emergency Call, and A Hero Lives. The first two cards are great for searching out all of your HEROs, but A Hero Lives has a rather steep cost and is best for an early game Dark Law in meta decks., Miracle Fusion is the best fusion spell they have access to, and is good in nearly any HERO deck. If you are using Blazeman, add Polymerization since he can search it out. Fusion Reserve and Fusion Conscription can be used if you use fusions with specific materials, and Fusion Recovery can recover your materials. If using specific materials, it can be a good idea to use fusion substitutes like King of the Swamp and Prisma.

, You can also use a few copies of Mask Charge to recycle Mask Change and Form Change to switch around your HEROs. Also, use cards like Call of the Haunted or Oasis of Dragon Souls to special summon Shadow Mist., These are powerful cards which can disrupt your opponent or get you out of a tough situation, and so are used in almost every deck. Add cards like Twin Twisters/Mystical Space Typhoon, Raigeki, Soul Charge, Solemn Warning, Solemn Strike, etc.

, Add the Masked HERO monsters if using Mask Change, and the generic HERO fusions if you have a fusion spell. Good Masked HEROs are Dark Law, Acid, Anki, and Koga, Dian and Divine Wind if using Form Change, and Contrast HERO Chaos if using Miracle Fusion. The best fusion monsters are the ones who only require a HERO monster and a certain attribute as their materials, like Absolute Zero, The Shining, Escuridao, and Nova Master. Also, include some Rank 4 Xyz monsters like Castel, Abyss Dweller, and Utopia and Utopia the Lightning, and Rank 8s like Hope Harbinger and Felgrand."

Buy a SD4 (Structure deck 4 Fury From The Deep).,
From your Starter deck, it is highly recommended you use all 3 of your Mother Grizzly and A Legendary Ocean.,
Find cards that will boost any WATER deck such as Warrior of Atlantis, a versatile card you could use to search out ""A legendary Ocean"", and Aqua Spirit, a Special Summon monster with decent ATK and a good Control Effect.,
If you choose Beatdown, get some High ATK Level 5 WATER monsters like Giga Gagagigo and Terrorking Salmon, which can be summoned without tribute from A Legendary Ocean.,
If you choose Control, get cards like Gora Turtle, Maryokutai, B.E.S.,
If you choose Combo, this means that you heavily rely on Levia-Dragon - Daedalus' and Codarus' Effects.,
Even if you only plan to use a Beatdown or Control-centered deck, read steps #5 - 7 to get more ideas for your deck.,
It can be a good idea to collect ""Shark"" cards from the new show.",How to Build a Yu Gi Oh! Water Deck," It has most of the cards you need for a water deck; for example, Levia-Dragon Daedalus;
, You can use your Levia-Dragon - Daedalus, Codarus, or both(Codarus is a card upcoming in Absolute Powerforce). At least 1 is recommended. Depending on the number of the above 2 cards you include, add in some Forgotten Temple of the Deep, also in Absolute Powerforce. This will count as ""Umi"" for Daedalus' and Codarus' effects.

, The number of Aqua Spirit(s) should vary depending on your type of water deck, but you should always have 3 Warrior of Atlantis.


WATER decks can be used in all 3 general deck strategies: Beatdown, Control or Combo. Choose what type your WATER deck will be.

, Use High ATK level 4 WATER monsters as well like Gemini Lancer, Abyss Soldier and Blizzard Dragon, although it has a Control Effect it still has High ATK. It's OK and actually encouraged for your Beatdown Deck to have a few Control elements and vice versa. Add in 1 or 2 Amphibious Bugroth MK-3, Mermaid Knight, and Star Boy. Use Spell cards that will help with Attacking or Swarming like Big Wave Small Wave or Hydro-Pressure Cannon (which will work with Level 4s from A Legendary Ocean). Generic Destruction Trap cards like Mirror Force and Sakuretsu Armor are recommended.

, Crystal Core, Nightmare Penguin and Penguin Soldier, which will all help you control the field and remove opponent's monsters. Add in 1 or 2 Amphibious Bugroth MK-3, Mermaid Knight, and Star Boy, although this deck will have less of these monsters than the Beatdown deck. Since most of these cards will be Low Level and Low Attack, use at least 2 Salvage, 2 Aegis of the Ocean Dragon Lord, and 1 Hydro Pressure Cannon. Use Gravity Bind and/or Level Limit Area B which is a must for Control Decks. Keep in mind Level Limit is Limited and Gravity Bind is Semi-Limited.

, In this deck, use a high number of either or both of them. If you have mostly Codarus' in your deck, then you want Low-Level Support Cards like Salvage and Mother Grizzly to search it out. If you have mostly Levia Dragon, use Big Wave Small Wave to summon it easier and Aegis of the Ocean Dragon Lord to protect your weaker monsters from his effect. And if you have AT LEAST 2 Levia-Dragon - Daedalus, add in an Ocean Dragon Lord - Neo-Daedalus, NO MORE than 2 because he is a ""dead draw"". Use 3 Forgotten Temple of the Deep, and 1 or 2 Pseudo Space to copy A Legendary Ocean.

, WATER decks are very versatile in this way and can change their playing style to fit the situation., Shark uses a variety of strong level 3 monsters to Xyz summon. Rank 3 monsters are currently the most populated, with 7, so you have plenty of options! However, the only two water Xyz monsters are Submersible Carrier Aero Shark and Leviathan Dragon.

This means doing a bit of research, if possible, and trying to get a feel for what types of decks are played most often, as well as the strategies, combos, and power cards used, in your area. This will help you decide what type of Frog deck to use. From this point up to the day you bring your Frog deck to it’s first Tournament you need to be going to tournaments regularly so you can get the best idea possible on the Metagame. Keep current on your metagame.;
,

There are multiple types of Frog decks out there; some are more successful than others.
Here is a list of Frog Deck types for you to consider:

DES Frog – When you have 3 “DES Frog” on the field you can use the spell card “DES Croaking” to destroy all cards your opponent controls on their side of the field.
Weenie Frog – By using the field spell “Wetlands” you can give most frogs a 1200 atk bonus. This is perfect when using cards like Unifrog, whose boosted 1600 ATK can attack directly, or Submarine Frog, whose boosted 2400 ATK deals damage when attacking defense position monsters.
Stall Frog – This deck is similar to the Weenie Frog deck, but takes a more conservative approach by using cards like Level Limit – Area B, and Gravity Bind, and even Messenger of Peace to make it harder for the opponent to attack.


A good way to research card effects and rulings is to visit the website www.netrep.net . This website is a widely used, and well known card search database that helps you to identify potentially helpful cards.

By doing a search for Frog in the Keywords tab, under “Name Contains” you can look up your frog monsters.
By doing a search for Frog in the “Text Contains” box you can find many cards that will be able to help your frogs in a way.
Also, keep in mind that there are a few more Frog cards that have been released recently that have not yet been uploaded to the Netrep Database, that are essential to any Frog Deck.



,,

This means building a deck that serves as a starting point, so that you can see what you’re working with. It’s good to start with your “Staples”.

, Here is an example deck list of a Conservative Weenie Frog deck that you can use as a Skeleton. If you play on Beyonds Duel Monster’s Unlimited, you can copy and paste this into the deck editor's “Add by Name” feature:

By using the tips and warnings at the end of this article you can prepare for your Metagame easier.

,

Change your skeleton so that it resembles something you feel could handle your Metagame.

,

If you have never played a frog deck before, now is a good time to see how it runs, before you get too far into it. Don’t take it to a tournament just yet; one of the greatest parts of running the frog deck is that people won’t expect it. Make sure you’re 100% happy with it before you play it at a tournament.

,

Repeat step 6 – 7 with trusted friends in a play setting until you feel comfortable with the cards rules, effects, and combos.

,

It probably took anywhere from a few weeks, to a couple of months to get there, but you’re there. If you don’t win the tournament, then take your loss and learn from it.

,,
Graceful Revival – Similar to Limit Reverse, but also works with Submarine Frog, but not Sangan.
Salvage – Helps to give you more cards to use for Abyss Soldier’s effect (will be covered later), or to reuse a lost substitoad, Dupe frog, etc.
Froggy Force field – The Frog version of Mirror Force; only use as filler if you are already using Mirror Force, otherwise it is not recommended that this card is used at all due to it’s requirement, and it’s non-chainability.

,
T.A.D.P.O.L.E. – The effect of Tadpole is difficult to pull off so some people may only use 2, or 1 and a Foolish Burial (Which also works well with Treeborn Frog)
DES Frog – When Tribute summoned you can special summon up to 2 more DES Frogs from your deck. You can only special summon as many DES Frogs as you have TADPOLE in your graveyard, however.
DES Croaking – When you have 3 DES Frog on the field, you can use this card to destroy all cards your opponent has on the field. You can also use Dupe Frog to help pull this card off, because it’s name is treated as DES Frog when it’s on the field (Face up).
Beelze Frog – It misses the requirements of Wetlands, but it can gain 300 atk for each TADPOLE in the graveyard. This effect turns it into 2400 at max.
Unifrog – It can attack directly, and if you have another frog on the field that is not named Unifrog when it deals battle damage this way, you can destroy an opposing spell or trap card.
Poison Draw Frog – Most people skip this card entirely, but it combos well with cards like Torrential Tribute, Needle Ceiling, and Froggy Force field.
Flip Flop Frog – This card has the ability to return any monster card on the field to the opponent’s hand, up to the amount of frogs you control. So if the opponent attacks it while face down, and you have other frog monsters on the field, its effect will still activate. You can also use his effect to flip itself face down.
D.3.S. Frog – The current only Frog Fusion. Requires 3 DES Frog – not recommended for use out of a fun deck.

,
Creature Swap – Combos well with Scapegoat and an ATK position Dupe Frog or Sangan
Needle Ceiling – Combos well with Flip Flop Frog, and Treeborn Frog, as well as Sangan, Dupe Frog, and Poison Draw Frog.
Abyss Soldier – Being able to discard unwanted monsters, like treeborn frog TADPOLE, or others that make it to your hand can be a plus. Also, most players are using Synchro monsters now, and Abyss Solder takes care of them (Including Stardust Dragon), as well as back row Spell or Trap cards that could be scaring you.
Card Destruction – With so many cards that return cards to your opponent’s hand, Card Destruction can help rid you of some you had trouble with (Such as Neospacian Grand Mole), as well as get you closer to other key cards, like Abyss Solder, and Needle Ceiling, or Salvage, and even Monster Reborn.
Hand Destruction – Similar to Card Destruction, use with caution. Combos well with Salvage.
Terraforming – Searches for Wetlands.
Level Limit – Area B & Gravity Bind – Prevents monsters over the Level of 3 from attacking. Most Frogs are LV 2 or 3. (DES Frog being the exception)
Messenger of Peace – Similar to LLAB and Gravity Bind, this card prevents monsters from attacking, but it only affects monsters whose ATK is 1500 or higher. During each of your standby phases you can choose to pay 100 LP, if you do not, Messenger of Peace is destroyed. This is beneficial, because if you are using Wetlands, you can allow your Unifrog to attack directly each turn without a big fear of anything coming at you afterwards, and then when you draw Terraforming or Wetlands, you can drop Messenger of Peace and boost up your monsters.
Winged Kuriboh, Kuriboh, and The Flute of Summoning Kuriboh – These cards can bail you out of a bad situation, or help to combo with Substitoad, and Needle Ceiling.

Decide your playing style.,
Choose your deck type - a themed deck, or one that follows a specific theme of cards.,
Choose your monsters.,
Control quantity - You should have:


LV 1-4: Around 12
LV 5-6: Around 2
LV 7s and higher: Never more than 2, depending on the deck.,
Choose your spells.,
Choose your traps.,
Fill out your Extra Deck.,
Lay out your cards and make sure that they work together well.,
Buy cards.,
Start playing with your deck.,
Refrain from using cards that are forbidden.,
Update your deck!",How to Build a Yu Gi Oh! Deck That Suits You," This is important, as it determines how people would look at you as a duelist. Are you a rash duelist who would rapidly summon, attack and activate cards? Or are you the deep thinker who would analyze your hand and field before making a move? Or maybe the duelist that would remove cards from play so your opponent cannot use them again? Considering these would help you choose a deck archetype.;
, Never have a deck with too many random cards in it. If so, you will not be drawing parts of combos. Also, make sure you have around 40 cards in your deck. The most you should have is 42.


The best decks focus around an archetype - a group of cards with similar names and mechanics who support each other. Decks focusing around an attribute or type aren't very good. Neither are most decks with multiple archetypes, though some mesh well.

, Each deck should have around 12-18 monsters, but the number will vary depending on the deck you play. Use low-level effect monsters that support your archetype and have helpful effects in your deck. Most decks do not use normal monsters, since they do nothing on their own, but they have some good support and are included in decks built around them.

, Some decks can and need to be all high-level monsters. These decks are usually able to summon their monsters some other way than tributing. For example, decks like Malefics and Infernoids can special summon all of their high level monsters. For many other decks, especially ones that rely on the extra deck, it is not recommended to include any high level monsters that you can't special summon.

, Most decks will have around 12-15 spells. Around 1/3 of these spells should be for monster support/combos. The rest would be attributed to favorites and staples. Add them into your list once you've decided. Make sure you have good spells for S/T destruction, monster protection, and monster destruction.

, You should have around 4-8 of these. Some decks will require more, and some less. Among these traps, 3-5 should be support for your deck type, and the rest should be staples like Mirror Force, Solemn Warning, and Bottomless Trap Hole. Think about your deck's weaknesses. For example, if your deck has weak monsters, use attack protection like Mirror Force and Dimensional Prison. If you play an aggro deck and are weak to traps, run stuff like Trap Stun.


If you're running a high monster count, such as in Dragon Rulers or Mermails, 3-6 traps should be enough. Some decks run no traps, and do fine. A good choice for a deck that relies solely on monsters would be Royal Decree.

, Most decks can use Xyz monsters. If your deck includes at least 3 easily summoned monsters of a certain level, you can add a couple of Xyz monsters of that Rank. Synchro and Fusion monsters are more specialized - Synchro monsters can be added if you have at least one tuner, and Fusion monsters are only used in specialized decks built around them.

, It's no use if you have cards that do not work together well. List the cards that you need to improve your deck and make it your business to buy those cards. Watch the cards your common opponents play. Also add some generic cards in your side deck that you can use later on, in between duels. Try looking up your deck type online to get tips or ideas from other people's decks.

, Now that you have planned out the deck you want, you can go out and get the cards you will need for it. Structure decks and Starter decks are good ways to start off. They are pre-built, and contain cards that fit together and good support, but could take some improvement. Booster packs have a variety of random cards, which won't necessarily work with your deck, but you could get some really good cards. You can also trade with friends and people at your local card shops, or buy singles online. If you are looking for a specific card, it will always be easier and cheaper to buy it individually rather than go hunting in booster packs for it.

, Play against friends and local players to learn the strengths and weaknesses of your deck. After a few games, you will have a better idea of how your deck runs, and may need to take out some cards that don't work for you. No deck is perfect, so you will always be modifying and improving your deck.

, Some examples are Monster Reborn and Pot of Greed. These cards are known to be too strong for normal competitive play, which would make your deck sort of 'cheating'. These cards can also cause fights with other duelists.


Remember to never use forbidden cards in tournaments. You could use them when dueling with a friend but he/she might not accept the offer.

, Wait for the newest booster packs to release and if the new cards suit your needs, buy a couple of packs to test your luck. Also, research older cards that will be good in your deck.

Know the rules of Yu-Gi-Oh.,
Pick a theme for your deck (i.e.,
Find the cards you need.,
Pick some monster cards (around 15-20) that correlate with your deck theme.,
Pick spell cards (10-15 cards) that correlate with your deck theme.,
Pick trap cards (8-12 cards) that will help you.,
Build an Extra Deck.,
If you're building this deck for tournaments, you'll want a side deck.,
Review your deck and see if it fits well.,
Remember to try out new combinations of cards, as you could come up with something good.",How to Build a Beginner Yu Gi Oh! Deck," If you aren't very familiar with them, keep the guidebook close by to refer to when you duel or build a deck.;
, Elemental HEROs, Dinosaur, Pyro, Exodia). Decks focused around a central archetype or theme will be more consistent and have access to good support, making you more likely to win. Do research to see what kinds of cards are good, or try to find cards you have lying around that work with each other. You won't be able to use archetypes, or cards with the same names, right off the bat, but you can use cards centered around an attribute or type, like ""Allure of Darkness"" or ""Onslaught of the Fire Kings"" to support a deck with a majority of monsters of one attribute or otherwise. Also keep in mind that some cards, like ""Mystical Space Typhoon"" or ""Raigeki"" can be used in every deck with success.

, Look through your collection and pick out cards belonging to or supporting your archetype, or research good cards online. If you need, buy or trade for some cards.

, (i.e. Dino monsters for a dino deck.) Use effect monsters with helpful effects, such as Man-Eater Bug and Neo-Spacian Grand Mole, as well as some with good attack. Good attack stats for monsters below level 4 are 1600-1800, monsters level 5-6 should have at least 2300, and ones with levels 7 or higher should have at least 2500. Don't include more than 4 or 5 high level monsters in your deck, unless you can reliably special summon them. Also, remember that attack points are not everything. A weak monster can have devastating effects, and a powerful monster could be easily destroyed by a spell or trap.

, Ensure you pick power-ups for your type of monster. If you don't have a specific type, then choose general ones. You should have good sources of spell/trap destruction, monster destruction, searching, and summoning.

, It may be harder to find trap cards that support your deck, so you can just go for generic traps. You should have good sources of attack protection, effect negation, summon negation, and/or spell/trap negation, depending on your deck type.

, The Extra deck can contain up to 15 cards, and you should fill it if possible. Add your archetype support cards, then get good generic Xyz monsters. They will work in almost any deck, as long as you have at least 3 monsters of the same level. Include Synchro monsters if you have a tuner. Fusion monsters are for more specialized decks.

, A side deck consists of up to 15 cards which are kept separate from your main deck. Between each duel in a Match (best out of three duels) you can swap cards between your Side and Main/Extra deck, depending on what you are facing. Side in cards that will help a lot against certain matchups, but are too situational to put in your Main deck. If you aren't planning to play in tournaments, you won't need to build a side deck.

, Make sure all the cards work well together and you will not get too many dead draws. Try it out against a friend in a duel to see how it runs. If there are cards that help a lot, try to maximize them while cutting out unhelpful, hard-to-use cards.

, Also, don't give up if it doesn't seem to work. Change some cards and try again.

Learn how to play Yu-Gi-Oh.,
Build a good deck.,
Build an Extra Deck.,
Test your deck.,
Understand card advantage.,
Know the current metagame.,
Understand card effects.,
Build a Side Deck.",How to Be Good at Yu Gi Oh!," Familiarize yourself with the rules, as well as different card interactions and mechanics. Yu-Gi-Oh! is a complicated game, so it is recommended that you keep the rulebook and wiki handy while playing, get advice from a more experienced player, and/or use a fully automatic online simulator like YGOPro or DevPro while you are learning.


Also have a good understanding of the more complex mechanics such as chaining, targeting, missing the timing, and different conjunctions.;
, Focus on one central archetype or theme in your deck, not a random collection of cards that don't work together. An archetype is a group of cards who share a common word or phrase in their name, whose effects support other cards of that archetype. Make sure your cards don't clash with each other, and take out cards that are useless in most situations. If you don't know what to build, you can look online for popular decks or even copy someone else's deck to get the hang of playing and deck-building.


Have a good balance of monsters, spells, and traps. A good ratio is 15-20 monsters, 10-15 spells, and 5-10 traps, but you don't have to follow this exactly.
Use effect monsters unless your deck focuses on normal monsters, since effect monsters are generally more useful. Get ones with good effects and stats, and don't use too many high-level ones or ones you can't summon easily. Have spells that destroy monsters, help you summon or search stuff, destroy spells and traps, and protect your monsters. Use traps that prevent summons, destroy stuff, negate stuff, and prevent attacks.
Keep your deck at 40 cards, or as close to 40 as possible. Keeping you deck close to the lower limit will help you draw the cards you need to win. If decking out is a serious problem for your deck, you could increase it to 41 or 42.

, The Extra Deck contains Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz monsters which you can summon using their own summoning mechanics. Since the monsters in the Extra Deck are so accessible and have useful effects, it can be a good way to save yourself or push for a win. There is a limit of 15 cards in the Extra Deck, so fit in as many as you can.


Xyz monsters are the most summonable cards in the Extra Deck. Since they only require two monsters of the same level, nearly all decks can bring them out. If your deck has three or more easily summoned monsters of the same level, you should include at least a few Xyz monsters of that Rank.
Synchro monsters will require a Tuner. Add the levels of your tuner(s) to your most commonly summoned monsters, and include some Synchro monsters of that level. Make sure you can fulfill any specific summoning requirements of the Synchro monsters, and that their effects will help your deck.
Fusion monsters are more specialized. Only use them if your deck is designed around Fusion. Use the ones with good effects and materials that are not overly specific.

, Find someone to duel against to see how well your deck runs. If a card just seems to be clogging up your deck, take it out. If your deck has a glaring weakness to something, shore it up with spell/trap cards. If you don't know what to use, you can check online for other people's builds to get more ideas or post in a forum for critique.

, Advantage is described in terms of pluses and minuses. For example, if you have 4 cards in your hand and play Pot of Greed, you will end up with 5 cards in your hand. Therefore, Pot of Greed is a +1 to hand advantage. Don't play cards that will use up a lot of your resources to accomplish very little. Instead, play cards that will increase your advantage. Also, be wary of cards that let your opponent draw or force you to skip drawing. These cards can be good if you are pushing for a win, but don't use them when it would help your opponent more than you.


Spells and Traps that make you discard cards are usually very powerful, but could be bad in a deck that can't maintain a large hand. On the other hand, paying life points or giving them to your opponent seems like a bad deal, but paying some LP is better than losing, and a few powerful attacks can easily take back any LP they've gained.

, In any given Yu-Gi-Oh! format, there will be a couple of decks which stand above the others in terms of consistency or power. Get to know these decks and their playstyles, so you will know how to play when facing one of these decks.

, Make sure to read all cards in your deck and all cards an opponent plays carefully, and have a good knowledge of what the text means. Read the full effect; don't just skim it. Be familiar with terms like ""Excavate"", ""detach"", ""destroy"", etc. If you use a card that you don't fully understand, look up rulings on it.

, A side deck is an additional 15 cards that you can switch with cards in your deck in between duels in a match (a set of three duels). It contains cards that are good in certain matchups, but are too situational to include in your main deck. If you will be playing in tournaments, a Side deck will help immensely. If you are not, it won't be necessary. Include in your side deck cards that shore up your deck's weaknesses and which help against the most common decks of that format.

Go first.,
Know they are playing Exodia.,
Know when they have Exodia.,
Use Mind Crush.,
Discard the pieces.,
Prevent them from drawing.,
Defeat them quickly.",How to Beat Exodia," If you already know they will play Exodia, volunteer to go first, or choose first if you win at rock-paper-scissors, coin flipping, etc. Exodia, unlike most OTK decks, is perfectly capable of winning on the first turn, because their win condition does not depend on attacking. If you go first, you will be able to set up the anti-Exodia cards mentioned later in this article.
, Seeing them add an Exodia piece using Pot of Duality or Sangan is a dead giveaway. When they do, be sure to remember that card. You can also tell if they are playing: a lot of draw cards (like One Day of Peace, Upstart Goblin, or Magical Mallet), deck thinning cards (like three Toon Table of Contents), or pieces of popular draw engines (Royal Magical Library and Spell Power Grasp, Heart of the Underdog with a bunch of normal monsters)., Time your discard cards for when you know you can hit one of the pieces. You can tell when your opponent has Exodia by watching the cards they play from their hands. If they are activating spells and setting traps as soon as they get them but always have a few cards left in their hand, they are probably Exodia. Also, if they play Magical Mallet, the cards they don't shuffle in will likely include the pieces. If they haven't won yet but have less than ~5 cards in their deck to go through, start panicking., Mind Crush is a versatile card which is included in most decks or side decks and is effective against the rest of the current metagame, something that does not apply to most of these other options. It is a trap card who's effect allows you to declare a card name. The opponent will have to discard all cards with that name from their hand. The best time to use this is when you have seen your opponent add an Exodia piece - usually with Pot of Duality or Heart of the Underdog, but maybe with Sangan or Witch of the Black Forest in Traditional format. If not, simply call an Exodia piece when your opponent seems to have a large enough hand. Mind Crush will force your opponent to reveal their hand for verification, so memorize any Exodia pieces present., Cards such as Deck Devastation Virus or Dragged Down into the Grave can be helpful, as they will be able to send the Exodia pieces to the graveyard. If they run cards that can retrieve Exodia, banish them with D.D. Crow, Soul Release, or D.D. Designator. If you want a surefire way to remove Exodia, use Exchange. This will allow you and your opponent to swap a card from the hand, and there is no way to get a card back from an opponent's hand., Null and Void is a good card for this, since it forces the opponent to discard all drawn cards when they draw. If they are running some sort of draw engine, try to negate the engine. If they play Hope For Escape, include ways to negate trap cards. If they use Royal Magical Library, negate the Library's summon or effect, or destroy it. You can also negate their spell cards with stuff like Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell, Light and Darkness Dragon, and Magic Jammer., If they aren't playing stall cards like Swift Scarecrow and Battle Fader, just attack them with powerful monsters. Chances are, if they are getting bad draws, they'll lose soon enough. Battle Fader's summon can be negated, and Swift Scarecrow can be negated with Mind Drain."

Good WIND archetypes are Harpies, Mist Valley, and Speedroids.,
Buy the Structure deck ""Lord of the Storm"".,
Add in your two ""Flying Kamakiri #1"" to your deck.,
Add 2 or 3 ""Simorgh, Bird of Ancestry"".,
Add in 2 ""Hunter Owl"", and 2 ""Icarus Attack"", because most of your monsters will also be Winged-Beast.,
Optionally, you can include a few ""Harpie lady"" cards.,
If it is within your budget, use ""Mist Valley Soldier"" and ""Mist Valley Shaman"" as your Tuner monsters.,
Add basic Staple Cards like MST, Torrential Tribute, etc.,
Fill the rest of your deck with cards of your choosing.",How to Build a Yu Gi Oh! Wind Deck," Speedroids can fit into almost any WIND deck, and let you make fast synchro plays and Rank 3 Xyz summons. The basic Speedroid engine is 3 Terrortop and 1-2 Taketomborg, though you can include 1 Tri-Eyed Dice or a few Speed Rebirth.;
, This will give you many cards to put in your WIND deck.

, Buy 1 more from some other source.

, This is not the same card in your structure deck. Keep this card in mind when you make your deck and include some level 5-6 WIND monsters to summon, like ""Swift birdman Joe""

, Add at least 1 ""Spiritual wind art Miyabi""

, Recommended are Harpie lady 1 especially, which will support your other WIND monsters. Use ""Elegant Egotist"" as well, but DO NOT use Harpie lady sisters.

, Try to get the synchro monster ""Mist Wurm"" which will go well with your deck. You can use ""Mist Valley Thunderbird"" for the effect of Mist valley shaman as well. Fill the rest of your extra deck with basic synchro monsters which require 1 tuner + 1 or more non tuners

, Since a lot of ""splash-able"" and ""staple monsters"" are DARK (Like sangan, breaker the magical warrior and gorz the emissary of darkness), you can try to include ""Dark Simorgh"", which will be very powerful but also very expensive. You can get it if you think you can afford it.

, You can include some from your structure deck, recommended are ""Bladefly"", ""Silpheed"" and ""sonic shooter."" You can also use Lady Ninja Yae + Gravity Bind and Level Limit area b to control your opponent's attacks until you use her effect. If you go this route, you can also include ""Tornado Bird"" and ""Sonic Jammer"", along with some ""Book of Moon"" for re-using the flip effects.

Find a bunch of dragon cards.,
Add Dragon support cards.,
Think of what other cards you can use.,
Add staples.,
Build an Extra Deck.,
You can also buy your own dragon structure deck.",How to Build a Dragon Deck in Yu Gi Oh!," If you have enough cards of one theme, like Blue-Eyes or Hieratic, you can opt for building a deck based around that archetype instead.;
, Good ones are Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, Dragon Shrine, Divine Dragon Apocralyph, Silver's Cry, Keeper of the Shrine, Queen Dragun Djinn, Dragon Ravine, Masked Dragon, and Dragon's Mirror.

, For example, if you have a lot of Level 8 monsters, you can use Trade-In. If you have a bunch of LIGHT types, you can run Honest. A lot of dragon support works for normal types, so you may actually benefit from having a few normal monsters in your deck.

, Staples are cards that fit in the majority of decks. Get cards like Twin Twisters/MST, Raigeki, Solemn Warning, Solemn Strike, Call of the Haunted, Dark Hole, and Bottomless Trap Hole.

, Add generic Xyz monsters you can summon. Many Dragon-Types are level 8 and Rank 8 Xyz monsters are very good, so consider building your deck around them. Ranks 7 and 4 are also good. Several Xyz monsters that support dragons are Queen Dragun Djinn, Hieratic Dragon King of Atum, Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon, and Dragluon. If you have Tuners, throw in some synchros you can make. There are also good dragon fusions, like Five-Headed Dragon. If you want to use fusions, the best fusion spell card available to you is Dragon's Mirror.

, There are many of them such as 'Saga of the Blue Eyes White Dragon' or 'Dragons Collide'. Your structure deck will be better if you buy three copies of the same one and add all the good cards.

Engage in regular play.,
Make every play to your own advantage.,
Target technical errors.,
Identify areas of weakness in your deck.,
Study new strategies and play-styles.,
Cultivate humility actively.,
Architect your deck to compensate for deficiencies.,
Review the criteria to become a pro-player.,
Accept bad luck without letting it cloud your judgement.,
Prevent burnout with planned breaks.,
Understand the ebb and flow of interest.",How to Be a Pro Magic the Gathering Player," Playing frequently against other players will not only expose you to different play-styles, it will also familiarize you with the thousands of unique cards that have been printed and could potentially be used against you.Regular play will teach you how to best respond to in-game developments with your tournament deck(s) and common scenarios that occur in the various styles of tournament play.


When practicing, focus on the quality of your play over mere quantity. If you are distracted, it's not likely you'll play your best game or take away as much as you would if you were rested, focused, and in a good mental state.
Make mental notes of your game as you play. Turning points are especially important, as these will help you evaluate things like the timing of your plays, the best instances to use certain strategies, and more.
Online play has created an invaluable resource to serious Magic players. Even if you live in an area where local, regional, national, or international tournaments aren't accessible, with an Internet connection you can easily practice against other players.
Speaking of local, regional, national, and international tournaments, these are vital events where you can test your skill as a planeswalker. You'll also be able to watch games between other pros during your free moments, which will give you a chance to scope out their cards and strategies.;
, Each of your tournament decks should have a goal that actively works against your opponent. Every play you make should be a step towards achieving that goal. Even if you feel out of your depth or hopelessly at a disadvantage, a lucky draw could keep you in the game or poorly timed execution by your opponent could return the advantage to you.


The goal of your deck shouldn't be too narrow or broad. For example, simply removing an opponent's creature from play could blind you to the larger strategic goals of your opponent, while ""playing to win"" doesn't give you a firm plan with which you can undo your enemy.
Having a goal for you deck and knowing it well will also make your deck more versatile. There may be slight modifications you can make to your normal play-style that throws a wrench into the machinations of the opposition. Try to keep an open mind to every way possible you might achieve the goal of your deck., In the heat of the moment, even veteran players can make poor judgement calls. A minor oversight can lose you in-game tempo or allow your adversary the wiggle room he needs to execute his own strategy. Mistakes can lead you to being overly hard on yourself, but each of these is an opportunity for you to learn more.


Take special note of instances where you notice you could have done something better. Analyze these to learn the signs and indicators that might tip you off next time you are in a similar situation. Predictive play can undo an opponent before he even gets a chance to make his move.
Technical errors will also help you learn the most optimal order in which you should execute your strategy. Different situations may require you to alter your order of play. By recognizing enemy moves before they happen and adjusting your own strategy to compensate, you'll stand the best chance of winning possible., Consistent losses in the same fashion might indicate a flaw in the build of your deck. An improper distribution of card types could make your chances of drawing the cards you need for victory unlikely. You might also notice that you're always regretting a certain card in your deck; these cards can often be exchanged for ones that are more helpful.


Some of your tournament decks might simply be ill-equipped to handle certain strategies. If you find your deck has an Achilles heel, consider ways you might protect yourself from this disadvantage. If you find this is impossible, you should evaluate whether or not that particular deck is worth taking to tournament.
Your in-game experiences can reveal unexpected flaws in your deck. Some cards and strategies work well on paper, but that doesn't always mean these work the best in real life., There are plenty of online resources, like Channel Fireball, that analyze strategies, probabilities, techniques, and more. You can also learn variations of your own strategy and the strategies of others by watching how players execute these at tournaments.


You should also be aware of changes in rules and requirements. You may have to rethink your strategy if a previously disallowed card or card type is permitted in the format of tournament play you specialize, like constructed or limited matches.Weigh your deck strategy against other dominant strategies that pros advocate. If you find your deck strategy can't hold its own against those of advanced players, you may need to make adjustments or even start from scratch.
After spending time, effort, and money building your deck to achieve a certain goal or enact a certain strategy, it can be difficult admitting it isn't good enough to go toe-to-toe with other pros. The hallmark of a true pro is adaptability; never be too proud to optimize your play-style., Even if you diligently analyze every game you play and note technical errors and deck weaknesses, if you are pretentious and look down on other players you may overlook game changing details. Even lower tier players may have strategies you need to account for, although these may be inexpertly executed.


Many serious player of Magic, sharing the same passion for the game you do, can become valuable allies and advisers. Never hesitate to ask questions, and always demonstrate good sportsmanship., Now that you've done your research and gauged your strategy against those of other top-tier players, you'll need to hunt for the right cards to neutralize the strategies that might undo your own. This can be an expensive and time intensive challenge. First:


Use online card catalogs to find your ideal deck. Some of these cards may be ultra-rare or outside of your price range. However, there might be ways you can accomplish the same effect as these ""super-cards"" with combinations of more accessible cards. Rank these from most to least important. Then...
Begin gathering the components of your ideal deck. You may find you need to start with the cheapest, most accessible cards. You might then use these to win money at regional tournaments and reinvest the prize money in the more expensive, less accessible cards. On the other hand, you might find you need to save up and purchase a super-card that's a lynch pin of your strategy. In either case, don't forget to...
Play-test changes to your deck. This can be a painful experience. After going to the effort of attaining a super-card, finding out in a play-test that it simply does not work can be heartbreaking. However, keep in mind the card will still have value to other players. Even if this card doesn't work out, you can sell it or trade it to help you get the cards you need., There are many routes you can take to reach the pro circuit and the Pro Tour Hall of Fame, and which of these is right for you will depend on your individual situation. You may be limited by finances, travel restrictions, or the need for a chaperon in the event you are a minor. However, the three main ways you can qualify for pro-play include:


Earning 33 match points, which is equal to winning 11 of 16 rounds, in previous year's Pro Tour.
Qualifying for the pro-tour through official qualifier tournaments (PTQ). This may also require placing in the tournament or making the point requirement for a Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQ).
Winning enough points or entering the single elimination stage in an official Grand Prix. In the event you are playing in a Grand Prix with less than 1200 players, you may be required to place in the top four.NOTE: the qualifying rules can change considerably from year to year. Be sure to check the official Magic: The Gathering qualifying conditions on the Wizards of the Coast homepage.

, Even the best build deck can be undone by a string of bad draws. Luck of the draw is a definite contributing factor in any of your games, and letting bad luck sour your mood can result in poor play in the instances you do have control.


The same is true for good luck. If you are having a phenomenal string of wins, any pro will tell you -- you're having a string of good luck. Which isn't to say you haven't worked hard to build your deck and plan your strategy, but overconfidence can lead to serious blunders.
If you find that you get overly emotional during games, or if you find that high tension games get the better of you, you might try meditation or other self-calming techniques. A surge of adrenaline can lead to a hasty mistake; learn to control adrenaline., Although most pros relate the importance of ""living, breathing, and eating"" Magic to quickly improve your game, playing too much without rest can ruin your drive. Many successful competitive players relate how they organize their tournament and practice schedules to make time for other hobbies, family, and romance, and you should too.Your hard work will be even more meaningful when it pays off if you have someone to share it with!


Before plunging headlong into the pro-circuit, you may want to use a trial run to see how you hold up. You may find the travel and practice schedule too intense, in which case you might decide not to invest as much time and money into Magic, instead keeping it as a hobby.
The drive to become the very best is an important factor for any top-tier player in any professional sport. However, if this gets out of hand, it can have a serious negative impact on your life. Be sure you are taking time to relax and unwind in whatever way you find most valuable., This does not mean that you should give up your practice schedule when the going gets tough or that you'll eventually get bored with Magic. This does mean that there will be times, as with any sport, when you feel you are on a plateau or that you are stuck in a boring cycle. Many professional athletes experience this; the difference between a pro and a dabbler is that a pro never gives up."

, Your deck is your army, your arsenal. In a ""constructed"" deck — one that you might use to play friends in an informal setting — the minimum amount of cards is 60, with no upper limit. Players, however, usually choose to stick to the minimum of 60 cards.


In a tournament setting, you might play a ""limited"" deck, which has a minimum number of 40 cards, with no upper limit.
A player's 60- or 40-card deck is also called their library.

, These 7 cards compose a player's ""hand."" At the beginning of each turn, a player draws one card and adds that card to their hand.


When a player discards a card, uses a card, or when a creature dies or a spell is destroyed, that card is put in a player's graveyard. The graveyard is a face-up pile that players usually place adjacent to their library.

, During the course of a game, a player can gain or lose life. Generally, having more life is better than having less life.


Players deal ""damage"" to both creatures and to each other. Damage is dealt either by creatures or by spells. Damage is measured by the number of hit points it causes.
If player one deals 4 damage to player two, player two loses 4 life. If player two started out with 20 life, she now was only 16 life. (20 - 4 = 16.)

, A player has lost the game when that player loses all of his or her life, or runs out of cards in their deck to draw, or has 10 poison counters.


When a player's life total is at or below 0, that player has lost.
When, at the beginning of their turn, a player can no longer draw any cards from his or her library, that player has lost.
When a player has received 10 poison counters, that player has lost.

,


White is the color of protection and order. The symbol of white is a white orb. White's strengths are a host of small creatures that collectively become powerful; life-gaining; reducing the powers of opposing creatures; and ""equalizing"" cards that wipe large swaths of cards off the board.
Blue is the color of deceit and intellect. The symbol of blue is a blue water drop. Blue's strengths are drawing cards; taking control of opponents cards; ""countering,"" or negating opponent's spells; and ""flying"" creatures or creatures that cannot be blocked.
Black is the color of decay and death. The symbol of black is a black skull. Black's strengths are destroying creatures; forcing opponents to discard cards; making players lose life; and returning creatures from graveyards.
Red is the color of fury and chaos. The symbol of red is a red fireball. Red's strengths are sacrificing resources for great power; dealing ""direct damage"" to players or creatures; and destroying artifacts and lands.
Green is the color of life and nature. The symbol of green is a green tree. Green's strengths are powerful creatures with ""trample""; the ability to regenerate creatures, or bring them back from the graveyard; and getting lands faster.

, Lands are one type of card and are the building blocks of spells. There are five basic lands, each associated with a color. Lands produce magical energy, or ""mana,"" which is the fuel used to cast other spells.


The five basic lands are as follows:
White lands, or Plains, which produce white mana
Blue lands, or Islands, which produce blue mana
Black lands, or Swamps, which produce black mana
Red lands, or Mountains, which produce red mana
Green lands, or Forests, which produce green mana


There are also different kinds of lands (dual- and tri-lands, for example), but the most a beginner needs to know is that basic lands produce mana of one color only, and that irregular lands can produce mana of two or more colors

, Sorceries are magical incantations that you can only cast during your own turn. You cannot cast a sorcery in response to another spell (you'll learn about this idea later). Sorceries usually go directly into the graveyard after they resolve.

, Instants are like sorceries, except you can cast them during the other player's turn in addition to your own, and you can cast them in response to a spell. Instants usually go directly into the graveyard after they resolve

, Enchantments are like ""stable manifestation."" Enchantments come in two flavors: either they are attached to a creature, affecting only that one card, in which case they are called an ""Aura""; or they sit around the battlefield, close to lands, unattached to any card in particular, but affecting the game in some way for you (and/or possibly for your opponent).


Enchantments are ""permanents,"" meaning that they stay on the battlefield, unless they are destroyed. Permanents do not immediately go to the graveyard right after they are cast.

, Artifacts are magical items, and also permanents. Artifacts are colorless, meaning they don't need to be summoned by a particular land or mana type. There are three basic kinds of artifacts:


Normal artifacts: these artifacts are similar to enchantments.
Equipment artifacts: these cards can be attached to creatures, giving them extra abilities. If the creature leaves the battlefield, the equipment stays on the battlefield; it doesn't follow the creature into the graveyard, even if it was attached to it.
Artifact creatures: these cards are creatures and artifacts at the same time. They are just like creatures, except they usually don't take specific mana to summon: you can summon them with any mana you want. Because they are often colorless, most are also immune to certain spells that affect specific colors.

, Creatures are one of the main building blocks of Magic. Creatures are permanents, meaning they stay on the battlefield until they are destroyed or otherwise removed from the game. The main feature of creatures is that they can attack and block. The two numbers in the bottom right hand corner (4/5, for example) help you determine a creature's attacking and blocking strength, respectively.


Creatures enter the battlefield with what's called ""summoning sickness."" Summoning sickness means that a creature cannot be ""tapped,"" or used, on the same turn it was brought into play. This means it cannot attack or use certain abilities that cause the creature to tap. On the other hand, the creature is allowed to block; blocking is not affected by summoning sickness.
Creatures have many special abilities, such as ""flying,"" ""vigilance,"" or ""trample"" that we'll learn more about later.

, A planeswalker is a powerful ally that is like a supercharged creature. They are very rare and don't always make appearances in games, and they change the fundamentals of the game slightly when in play.


Each planeswalker comes with a certain number of loyalty counters, indicated in the bottom right side by a number. The symbol ""+X"" means ""put X number of loyalty counters on this planeswalker"" when you use an ability, while ""-X"" means ""remove X number of loyalty counters from this planeswalker"" when you use the ability. You can activate these abilities, and the powers that come with them only when you can use a sorcery, and only once per turn.
Planeswalkers can be attacked by your opponent's creatures and spells. You can block the oncoming attack on the planeswalker with your creatures and spells. In the case that your opponent deals damage to a planeswalker, it removes as many loyalty counters as points of damage dealt.

, You summon a creature by looking at its casting cost, which is usually a circled number followed by a specific color of mana — either white, blue, black, red, or green. In order to summon a creature, you need to produce mana equivalent to the card's casting cost.


Take a look at the card above. You'll notice a ""1"" followed by a white mana symbol — the white sun. In order to summon this particular card, you need to have enough lands to produce one mana of any color, along with one white mana.

, See if you can't figure out how many mana total, and which specific kinds, it takes to summon the following card:


The first card, ""Sylvan Bounty,"" costs 5 colorless mana — mana of any kind you want — along with one green mana — mana produced by a forest, for a total of six mana. The second card, ""Angelic Shield,"" costs one white mana — mana produced by a Plains — along with one blue mana.

, ""Tapping"" is how you ""use"" the mana in lands, or how you attack with creatures. It's denoted by the little right arrow sign. In order to tap, you turn the card sideways.


Tapping a card means that you cannot use certain abilities for one turn. If, for example, you tap a card in order to use its ability, it stays tapped until the beginning of your next turn. You can't use its tapping ability again until it is untapped.
In order to attack, you need to tap your creature. A creature expends its energy going into battle, causing it to be tapped. You do this unless the card specifically says you should not tap it. (Some cards do not tap when they attack.)
You cannot block with a creature that is tapped. When a creature is tapped, it is ineligible to block.

, Creatures have one number for power and another number for defense. The following creature, Phyrexian Broodlings, has a power of 2 and a defense of 2. It's a 2/2.


Power is the number of points a creature can deal in combat. If a creature has a power of 5, it deals 5 damage to any creature who chooses to block it in combat. If that creature goes unblocked in combat, it deals 5 damage directly to the opponent, who subtracts that number from his or her total life.
Defense is the number of points a creature can withstand in combat before it dies and is sent to the graveyard. A creature with a defense of 4 can withstand 3 points of damage in combat without dying. Once it is dealt 4 points of damage, it goes into that player's graveyard at the end of combat.

, When a player chooses to attack another player in combat, attackers and blockers are declared. Attacking creatures are declared first. The defending player then gets to choose which of his or her creatures s/he wishes to use as blockers, along with which attacking creatures s/he wants to block.
Let's say that Anathemancer is attacking and Magus of the Moat is blocking. Anathemancer has a power of 2 and a defense of 2. It's a 2/2. Magus of the Moat has a power of 0 and a defense of 3. It's a 0/3. What happens when they square up for battle?
The Anathemancer deals 2 damage to the Magus, while the Magus deals 0 damage to the Anathemancer.
The 2 damage that the Anathemancer deals to the Magus isn't enough to kill it. The Magus can withstand 3 damage before it gets put in the graveyard. On the flip side, the 0 damage the Magus deals to the Anathemancer isn't enough to kill it. The Anathemancer can withstand 2 before it gets put in the graveyard. Both creatures survive.

, Much of the time, creatures come with abilities that players get to activate. Using these abilities is much like summoning the creature, in that you need to pay a ""cost,"" in mana, to use them. Look at the following example.


Ictian Crier comes with an ability that says: ""Put two 1/1 white Citizen creature tokens into play."" But there's also some mana signs and text before it. That's the mana cost it takes in order to activate this ability.
In order to activate this ability, tap one basic land of any color (that's for the 1 colorless mana), as well as one Plains (that's for the one white mana). Now tap the card itself, Ictian Crier — that's for the ""tap"" sign after the mana requirements. Finally, discard a card from your hand — any one will do, but you probably want to discard your least valuable card. Now you get to put two 1/1 Citizen tokens into play. These function as basic 1/1 creatures.

, Each player's turn has five phases, or steps. Understanding what these five phases are and how they work is an essential part of understanding gameplay. In order, the five phases are:

, The beginning phase has three different steps:

Untap step: the player untaps all his cards unless that card stays tapped during Untap.
Upkeep step: not usually used, but sometimes a player has to pay mana — i.e. tap lands — during this step.
Draw step: the player draws one card.







, During this phase, a player may put down one land from his or her hand. Also during this phase, a player may choose to play a card from his or her hand by tapping lands to produce mana.

, This phase is split into five steps.

Declare attack: this is where the player first declares attack. The defender may play spells after the attack has been declared.
Declare attackers: after attack has been declared, the attacking player chooses which creatures he wishes to attack with. Attacking player cannot choose which defending creatures he wishes to attack.
Declare blockers: the defending player chooses which, if any, attacking creatures s/he wishes to block. Multiple blockers can be assigned to a single attacker.
Assign damage: creatures deal damage to one another during this step. Attacking creatures with equal (or higher) power compared the blocking creature's defense destroy that blocking creature. Blocking creatures with equal (or higher) power compared the attacking creature's defense destroy that attacking creature. It is possible for both creatures to destroy each other.
End of combat: nothing much happens during this phase; both players are given the opportunity to cast instants.

, After combat, there is a second main phase, identical to the first, in which the player can cast spells and summon creatures.

, During this phase, any abilities or spells that ""trigger"" take place. This is a player's last chance to cast instants.


During this phase, the player whose turn is about to end discards down to 7 cards if s/he has more than 7 cards.

, Creatures with flying cannot be blocked by creatures without flying. In other words, if a creature has flying, it can only be blocked by another creature with flying or a creature that can explicitly block creatures with flying, such as a creature with reach.


Creatures with flying, however, can block creatures without flying.

, First strike is a concept in attacking. When one creature is attacking and a player chooses to defend that attack with a blocker, you measure their strengths and toughness against one another. The strength of one is measured against the toughness of the other, and vice versa.


Usually, damage is assigned at the same time; if the attacking creature's strength overpowers the defending creature's toughness, and the defending creature's strength overpowers the attacking creature's toughness, both creatures die. (If neither creature's strength is higher than the opponent's toughness, both creatures stay alive.)
If, however, one creature has first strike, that creature is given a ""first chance shot"" at knocking the other creature out with impunity: if the creature with first strike can kill the defending creature, the defending creature dies immediately, even if the defending creature would otherwise kill the attacking creature. The attacking creature stays alive.
For example. if an Elite Inquisitor (a 2/2 with first strike) blocks a Grizzly Bear (a 2/2 with no abilities), the Inquisitor deals damage before the Bear can, so the Bears dies and the Inquisitor survives

, Vigilance is the ability to attack without tapping. If a creature has vigilance, it can attack without tapping. Normally, attacking means that you need to tap your creature.


Vigilance means that a creature can attack and block in successive turns. Normally, if a creature attacks, it cannot block the next turn. With vigilance, a creature can attack and then block the next turn because it isn't tapped.

, Haste is the ability to tap and attack the very same turn a creature gets into play. Normally, creatures must wait a turn to tap and attack; this is called ""summoning sickness."" Summoning sickness does not apply to creatures with haste.

, Trample is an ability creatures have to deal damage to opponents even if that creature is being blocked by an opponent's creature. Normally, if a creature is blocked, the attacking creature only deals damage to that blocking creature. With trample, the difference between the trampling creature's strength and the blocking creature's toughness is dealt to the opponent.


For example, let's say that Kavu Mauler is attacking and Bonethorn Valesk decides to block it. The Mauler is a 4/4 with trample, while the Valesk is a 4/2. The Mauler deals 4 damage to the Valesk, while the Valesk deals 4 damage back to the Mauler. Both creatures die, but the Mauler manages to sneak in 2 damage to the opponent. Why? Because the Valesk's toughness is only 2, and the Mauler has trample, which means 2 of its 4 damage gets dealt to the Valesk, and 2 gets dealt to the opponent.

, A creature dealt damage by a creature with deathtouch dies, no matter how much damage that is.

For example, a Frost Titan (a 6/6 creature) blocking a Typhoid Rats (a 1/1 creature with deathtouch) will die. The Rats will also die.

, Double strike is like first strike, in that the creature with double strike deals damage first. Then it attacks again... before the defending creature has a chance defend the first strike. Then, the turn proceeds as usual, where the second strike's attack damage is resolved at the same time as the defender's damage (as in normal combat)."

Assemble a total of at least four players
,
Obtain three booster packs for each player.,
Randomly seat your players at the table.,
Pass out the first booster to each player.,

The judge should begin the instructions to the players before the drafting begins
,
Instruct the players that each round they will have 30 seconds to view the cards in the pack and make a single card selection.,Tell the players that once they have made their selection, they need to pass the pack face-down to the player to their left in rounds one and three and to the right in round two.,
The judge will announce ""pass"" once the time limit is reached - the players may then view the next pack and the judge should start the timer.,The judge shall set the countdown timer, instruct the players to open the first pack, and start the timer.,Each player should sort through the cards in their pack, select a single card that is placed on the table in front of them, and set the remainder aside for the next player.,Once the judge has called ""pass"" the player should pick up the pack passed to them from the adjacent player, sort and select as in the prior step.,The pick-and-pass process continues for 15 rounds until the first round packs are exhausted.,After each round of the draft, players may review their drafted cards for a predetermined amount of time (30-60 seconds is usually enough) before the next round begins.,The judge should pass out the boosters for round two while the players review their cards.,
After the review period has passed, the judge should remind the players to pass right in the second round.,The second round proceeds as the first round, each player picks-and-passes until the packs are empty.,The judge should now instruct the players to review their cards for the predetermined time while passing out the final booster.,Remind the players to pass to the left in round three.,
Instruct the players to open the final booster pack.,
The players must now split to construct their decks.,

The tournament can be organized in any manner the judge determines.,
Each round is best two of three games.",How to Hold a Magic: The Gathering Booster Draft,", The boosters can be of any set, and in any mixture, but staying within a single block is usually best - for instance Mirage, Visions, Weatherlight or Tempest, Exodus, Stronghold. No more than three sets should be used, as you will need one of each booster for each player for each round., Drafts should be eight players or fewer - so if you have 16 players, you'll need two separate tables of 8., The boosters should be of the same set for each round of the draft. If playing a single block, boosters should be passed out in the order of the block - i.e. Tempest then Stronghold then Weatherlight.,, You may choose to lower the time limit to 15 seconds if the players are all familiar with the set.,, Players are not permitted to preview the next deck while awaiting the judge's declaration.,,,,,,, Instruct the players to open their second pack.,,,, The final round proceeds as the prior two, each player selecting a card and passing the remains until the packs are once again empty.,

Place the players under a mindful eye to prevent cheating by adding in outside cards.

Ideally, the players should have no contact with any cards except their drafted deck and basic land provided by the judge.


Using the cards drafted, plus any basic lands as provided by the judge, the players should construct a 40-card-minimum play deck. All remaining cards become the sideboard. Formal play may require the players post a deck-list once their deck construction is complete.

Unlike constructed play, booster draft rules allow for any number of a single card to be used in a deck.



,

Bracketed - The players are organized on a bracket chart, and are matched up randomly against an opponent. Bracketed can be played as single or double elimination.
Round robin - Players play one round against each other opponent, after the final round, the players with the two best overall records play for the championship

, Generally, there is a one hour time limit each round."

Your hands and fingers should also be loose and pointing down at the floor., The term ""dominant hand"" refers to the hand you are most comfortable with for precision tasks. This generally equates to the hand you use to write, handle tools, or throw a ball.In some cases, your sword hand may not be the same as the hand you use for writing or using tools.
To verify your sword hand, hold a straight piece of wood or a household item. This should be roughly the length of your forearm. The hand in which this is most comfortable is your sword hand.

, When you spread your fingers out, the space between your thumb and forefinger will form a V-shape. With your hand still loose at your side and your fingers pointing toward the ground, use a tape measure to determine the distance between the same side eye as your dominant hand and the base of this V-shape in your dominant hand.This measurement can be difficult to take accurately without help. You may want a friend or family member to assist you in this.

, Generally, when you are within a ½ in (1.2 cm) of the next full inch mark, round up to the next inch. When you are over a ½ in from the next full inch, round down to the next full inch mark.Depending on the kind of sword you are using, sizing conventions can vary. These measurements are for a modern, straight bladed military saber.
Most mass produced bladed weapons, like swords, are broken down into sizes. These sizes are generally in standardized increments, like 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm).
As an example of a sword with a different size expectation, a traditional broadsword ranges from 30 to 45 inches (76.2 to 114.3 cm)., Use a piece of wood that's slightly larger than your ideal size. This will allow you to some room for error when you use a knife to shave away excess wood with a knife to shape your sword.

To check your wood for rottenness, strike it against a hard surface. If it breaks or cracks, select another piece of wood., Use a pencil to draw the approximate shape of your sword on the 2x4. This shape can be curved, like a traditional katana or scimitar, or straight edged on both sides with an angled or triangular point.

When drawing your outline, remember the cross guard of the sword. This is located at the base of the blade, between the blade and handle of the sword.The tip of swords are generally angled or pointed. Be sure to include this in your outline. A 45° angle from the tip to one side of the sword will provide a suitable angled point.

, Measure the ideal length of your sword on your wood and mark it with a pencil. Use a hand saw to cut free excess length from the wood. Remember to cut along the angle or point you've drawn on the wood for the point., A sharp woodworking knife will work best for this, but any sharp, sturdy knife can be used. Carve away wood to create the blade of your sword./images/thumb/c/c0/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/c/c0/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg









For one-sided blades, the blade should narrow on its ""sharp"" side, creating a triangular shape. The wood should thicken toward the opposite, non-bladed side.
For double sided swords, the shape of the blade will be roughly that of a diamond. The thickest part of this blade will be at the center of the blade, with both ""edged"" sides thin.

, A somewhat elliptical (oval) shape will work best for your handle, which should be thinner than the blade. The cross guard should also be thin and form the crossing part of a t-shape between the blade and handle./images/thumb/7/7b/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/7/7b/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg









An oval shape will be more comfortable to hold onto when using your sword than a purely circular one.To make a distinct cross guard, a file will work best. Use your knife to form the general outline at this point. Later, you'll use sandpaper to smooth it, and a file to make it distinct.

, Hold your sword in your hand. If it feels heavy, continue using your knife to shave away wood from the thickness of the blade and handle.
/images/thumb/9/9c/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/9/9c/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg









Some wood is heavier than others. Heavier woods may require very thin blades and handles for them to be of comfortable weight.
Making the blade and handle of your sword too thin can compromise your sword's sturdiness.

, Use medium grit sandpaper (60 to 100 rating) to take off rough, irregular edges and burrs from the wood. Use firm pressure and to rub the wood with the sandpaper.
/images/thumb/d/d1/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg

Be patient with this process. Sanding can take a while, but a well sanded sword will look more professional made.
To speed up this process, you could clamp your sword to a work bench and use a hand sander., This will make your sword look stylish, but will also provide you a better grip on the handle when using your sword. Wind electrical tape around the handle of your sword to make a grip./images/thumb/d/d3/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d3/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg









Sweat from your hand along with the force of hitting something with your sword can jostle it from your grasp if you don't have a grip.
Alternatively, you can use duct tape for the grip of your sword. Different patterns/colors of tape can be used to suit your preference.

, A file will allow you to make more precise, deeper notches in the top of the handle and bottom of the blade. Take your file and remove wood directly above and below the cross guard.

Using a file in this fashion will better separate your cross guard from the handle and blade the sword.

, Cut a piece of wood, plastic, or metal in a circular shape that is roughly 2 in (5 cm) thicker than your sword handle. Cut a hole directly in the center of this that is just barely larger than your sword handle.
/images/thumb/8/83/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg

Slide the separate cross guard piece up the handle. The guard should catch where the blade thickens and go no farther.
To hold your cross guard in place, wrap twine or string around the guard. Alternate between the top and bottom of the guard so the string winds along the base of the blade and top of the handle. Tie the string off in a simple knot.

, Tie tassels to the base of the handle of your sword.Use a marker to draw designs on the blade. Etch designs in your sword with a knife./images/thumb/a/ae/Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-13-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Wooden-Sword-Step-13-preview-Version-3.jpg

Prepare simple decks.,
Tell them the very basics.,
Start the game.,
Have each player reveal their hand.,
Teach them about lands and the mana system.,
Teach them the important phases in  the game.,
Teach creature combat.,
Play out the game.",How to Teach People Magic: the Gathering," Before you even start teaching someone the game, you must make sure that the decks you use are up to the task. The win conditions of both decks absolutely must be reducing the opponent's life total with creatures as that is the core of the game and any deviation from that will mean that  the opponent is confused. The decks must also have a large amount of ""Vanilla"" creatures: creatures with no abilities, so that your pupil understands simple combat. However, the deck must also have resonant cards with cool art, so that they will be interested in the first place.;
, Don't go into detail, but say that you use  mana to summon creatures and spells, and  that the aim is to reduce life totals  from 20 to 0.

, Have them shuffle their deck and draw seven cards and do the same. It might be tempting to teach them all about the game before they play it, but you want them to get playing as soon as possible. This is so they can interpret the information you tell them in context. Also, playing a game is  far more fun than just sitting down and listening.

, It is hard to teach what can and can't be played without knowing what is in your opponent's hand, so this makes it far easier.

, Playing a land is (almost always) the first game action you do in MTG, so tell them how to play their lands and get them to play one. They'll probably be interested in casting their other spells, so teach them about that too (and help them while applicable).

, You don't need to tell them all the phases and steps (Such as the end of combat phase or upkeep) but do tell them about the key ones; untap, draw, first main, combat and second main.

, When the players have creatures on board, you need to explain how they attack and block. Many new players seem to think that you can directly attack creatures, so emphasize that you cannot. Try to explain this well, as this part of the game is (obviously) key. This is where having mostly vanillas in your deck is important, as you don't want mechanics like deathtouch stuffing up their conception of combat and making it harder to explain.

, While doing this, be patient. It may seem odd to you that they need combat explained every turn, but Magic is really hard and you were new once as well. Also don't tell them what to do all the time. You know the correct play, but they need to feel like they are playing against you, not sitting back while you play against yourself. Even if their play is frustratingly bad, let it slide unless it violates rules. Give them general tips, sure, but don't direct their every move.

If you have an electric saw and the know-how to use it, a simple oval or circle pattern works well too.
You can also create plans for a design or logo for the front of the shield. You can just paint the entire shield a solid color, but a pattern or design adds character.
The size of an authentic shield varies depending on its intended useand the size of the person who will use it. A basic shield should at least be the width of the user's shoulders and the length of the user's torso.;
, Using simple materials will help keep the beginner's shield streamlined and easy to put together.


A light weight wood is best, such as plywood or fine particle board. You will want a unfinished wood that is easy to cut and at least half an inch thick and about two feet wide and four feet tall,a standard size available at most lumber yards.
While more advanced (and historically accurate) shields generally have leather handles on the inside,beginner fighters can use a handle purchased at a hardware store. It is easier to make and to attach, and simple to hold. Look for a smooth handle that will not hurt your hand if you grasp it tightly, such as a bail pull from the knob and handle section of the hardware store. You will need screws or short nails to attach it to the shield.

, Using your plans as a guide, trace the design in pencil on the wood, on what will be the back of your shield.


You can use a ruler or other straight edge if you've decided to go with a rectangular shaped shield.
Use a large compass to make a circle for a rounded shield.
If you are not completely happy with your design, trace it again. Don't cut until you're sure!

, You will need a saw, and although you can use a hand saw, it will be a lot of work. A bandsaw is ideal.Go slowly for accuracy and safety.

, How you attach the handle depends on how securely you need it to stay in place.


If you are not going to use the shield roughly, you can secure the handle using small nails or screws. Otherwise, if the shield will see a lot of action in battle, secure it using bolts.

, You can use a solid color paint, or create a replica design from a historic time period. You can also create your own coat of arms to feature on the front if you are artistic.


Sand any rough spots or edges before painting, then apply a thin layer of primer, which will help the paint to adhere. After it is dry, apply another layer of primer and let dry.
Apply a thin layer of paint in your color of choice. You can use either oil- or water-based paint, but it is important that you use the same kind for both primer and paint or the paint will peel off.After the first layer of paint dries thoroughly, add another layer if you prefer, then let it dry before hand painting on details. Remember to use oil- or water-based paint for the detailing, too, according to what you used for your primer and base color.
Add a layer of polyurethane coating once everything else has dried, and let it sit for 48 hours to cure. The polyurethane will seal the paint in so that it does not chip., Using posterboard and a pencil, sketch the shape you want your final product to be, and make notations about the length and height.


The base of a shield is often a circle or an ellipse, but with your skill level you can expand your design to more complex patterns. Do an internet search for ""shield shapes"" to get some ideas.
Historically, the size and shape of the shield depended on its intended use. For example, a swordsman would use a small shield such as a buckler, which is lightweight yet not cumbersome. An infantryman would need a tall shield to duck behind or cover the legs during an assault.For historic authenticity, research the particular type of shield you want to make and find out its ideal dimensions and shape.
Many historic shields were convex, curving around the user's body to protect the user in battle by deflecting swords and arrows. However, you would need advanced technological equipment in order to bend your wood.You can purchase a wood press online or in some large hardware stores if you are interested in bending the wood for a convex shape., If you are going to use the shield for re-enactment or simply want a more authentic piece of armor, you will need a solid piece of wood such as oak. You can use other types of wood if it is more authentic to the type of shield you are trying to create (for example, English, Scottish, Viking, etc.).


Historically, medieval European shields were made from several layers, with a core made of oak. You will need a 2' by 4' piece of solid unfinished oak,and optionally, as many pieces of plywood in the same size plywood to make additional layers. Keep in mind, solid oak is heavy, and additional layers will make a very heavy shield!
Most authentic shields have heavy leather straps as handles.You will need two thick leather pieces about six inches wide and a foot long. These are available at crafting supply stores.

, If you read the instructions for a beginner's shield, you will notice that these steps are similar.


Trace the design on the wood in pencil, by cutting out your poster board design and using it as a guide.
Cut the wood out using a bandsaw or handsaw (a bandsaw will make it much easier, but use what you have). If you are using additional layers of plywood, cut them out to the same pattern.
If you are using plywood, attach it using a thick layer of wood glue to the front (and back, if you're using two layers) of the oak layer. Let it dry thoroughly before continuing.

, Add two leather straps to put your arm through across the back of the shield, which will allow you to hold the shield with one arm and a weapon with the other.


Hold the shield up to your body to determine the natural placement of the straps. Holding the shield up with your non-dominant hand, place your dominant hand across the back of the shield where it naturally falls when you hold the shield in place and your arm at a ninety degree angle.
Mark the outline of your forearm on the back of the shield with pencil. This will show you where to secure the straps, about six inches apart directly above and below where your arm will go.
Secure the leather straps using metal bolts.

, You can use a solid color paint, or create a replica design from a historic time period. You can also create your own coat of arms to feature on the front if you are artistic.


Sand any rough spots or edges before painting, then apply a thin layer of primer, which will help the paint to adhere. After it is dry, apply another layer of primer and let dry.
Apply a thin layer of paint in your color of choice. You can use either oil- or water-based paint, but it is important that you use the same kind for both primer and paint or the paint will peel off.After the first layer of paint dries thoroughly, add another layer if you prefer, then let it dry before hand painting on details. Remember to use oil- or water-based paint for the detailing, too, according to what you used for your primer and base color.
Add a layer of polyurethane coating once everything else has dried, and let it sit for 48 hours to cure. The polyurethane will seal the paint in so that it does not chip., If you notice that your handle has splits or cracks in the wood after battle, repairing before your next re-enactment. You can add wooden stays or leather straps bolted in place to repair the damage if the area is small enough.


Cut wooden slats or thick leather strips a couple of inches wide by a couple of inches long (or however long you need to secure it on both sides of the crack). Bolt these in place on either end.

, It is important to have a secure handle so that you don't lose hold of your shield during battle. If your handle breaks, you can either grab the shield with both hands (which means putting down your weapon), or put down the shield (which means exposing you to oncoming attacks).


Be sure that the handle is on securely before going in to battle.
Replace a damaged, split, or frayed leather strap or handle at first sign of wear. Don't wait for it to fall off completely before repairing.

, Dents and dings in your shield add character and make your shield seem more realistic.


If you hate having dents in your shield, you can use sandpaper to try to buff them out. You will need to repaint that area.

, If your shield is split in half during re-enactments or battle, you will need to build a new one.


This time, try making a more advanced shield; you've already practiced once!

Purchase or find a piece of steel about 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide and .5 inches (1.27 m) thick and slightly more than 3 feet (0.9 m) long (0.914 m).,
Heat the steel in a furnace or open hearth.,
Pull the heated material from the hearth when it becomes a yellow-orange hue and put it on an anvil.

,
Forge the steel.,
Shape the blade.,
Treat the blade with a special clay mixture.,
Quench the steel.,
Temper the blade.,
Remove the clay mixture from the blade and grind the blade edge until it is sharp.

,
Polish the blade.,
Drill two holes at the base, or tang, of the blade to help fasten it to the hilt.

,
Fabricate the handle.,
Secure the blade to the hilt.",How to Make a Samurai Sword,";
, You must heat the material to temperatures nearing 1,600 degrees F (870 degrees C) to make it malleable for forging and to remove impurities. During the heating process, substances like sulfur and silica will oxidize and separate from the iron, creating slag. The removal of slag greatly strengthens the steel.

,,


Strike the substance with a hammer, turning it as you forge. You will need to reheat the substance during the forging process to keep it malleable.
Bend and chisel the substance on the anvil to form the blade shape. Target your hammer strikes to help shape the blade. Focus on the basic proportion of the blade initially.
Forge the sword tip once you are satisfied with the basic blade shape, and then work on curvature and bevels. Bevel the blade in two sections: a long, sharp bevel extending to the tip of the sword provides the cutting edge of the sword and the shorter, thicker section runs along spine of the sword.
Taper the blade on the end that will join with the handle.

, Use grinders and files to form the final shape of the blade.

, You can add a mixture of clay and other substances, like grass and feathers, to the blade to achieve desired results. Coat the spine of the blade with the mixture, leaving the edge largely untreated. This will help make the spine flexible and the edge sharp. Reheat the blade in the forge.

, This process both cools and hardens the substance. You can use water or oil for quenching.


Immerse the blade in water or oil along the edge and tip first. This method has a dual purpose: to make the cutting surface hardest and to keep the back of the blade softer to absorb blows meted out by adversaries. Quenching technique is important as the faster you quench the blade, the harder it becomes.

, Reheat the blade to about 400 degrees F (204.4 degrees C) after quenching and then allow it to cool to room temperature. This process helps balance the blade's flexibility and hardness.

,, Use water stones to sharpen the blade. When polishing is complete, the hardened and unhardened portions of the blade will become apparent. Give the blade a final filing for cosmetic purposes.

,, The sword handle, or hilt, must be long enough to accommodate both hands and provide optimum balance when joined to the blade.


Build the handle out of a hardwood, like yellow poplar or alder. Quarter-saw the wood at the end to provide maximum strength.
Install two brass or copper pegs and anchors and align them with the tang. They will hold the blade in place.

, Insert the hilt pegs through the holes in the blade's tang and fasten them to their anchors. Use industrial adhesive and leather wraps to further strengthen the attachment of the blade and handle.

Determine the length of your broadsword.,
Find wood.,
Cut the wood to appropriate lengths; then cut the corners off what will become the tip of your blade: these should be equal cuts resulting in an isosceles triangle with an acute top angle (a refresher course in geometry may be recommended.),
Speaking of sanding, take out your coarse grit sandpaper, and prepare to sand away furiously.,
Congratulate yourself; you got past the hard part (sanding).,
After the lacquer has dried for at least 24 hours, it's time to break out the metallic paint!,
Now take some black electrical tape and wrap one line around the 6-inch mark mentioned above.,
Last, wind your handy black electrical tape in a slowly descending spiral down the hilt, and tape off another circle right above your gold painted pommel (you approximate this.,
If you are one of them fancy types, you can deck out your glorious hilt and pommel with fake jewels, or maybe wind a strap of leather in a criss-cross pattern to hide the nails.",How to Make a Wooden Broadsword," To do this, measure from the top of your hip to the ground. This will be the length of both your blade and hilt. However, if you are fighting someone of equal size as yourself, you should make them equal size, for sparring.;
, One half inch thick, and one and one quarter inches wide is a suitable thickness and width for a broadsword, and is the same dimension as baseboard you can find at the local Home Depot. Be aware that this means one of your edges will be rounded, but in the grand scheme of things, the enemy you just beheaded won't notice. Also, get some smaller pieces for the hilt, about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long (although this varies in accordance with your sword length), same width, and 1/4th inch thick.

, Off the bottom (what will be the pommel), make also equal cuts, but this angle should be obtuse, since you intend to sand this into a rounded shape.

, Hey-- no complaining, this is part of being a master swordsman. Sand your blade point until the triangle becomes rounded, and sand the pommel so that it becomes rounded. It is also a merciful practice to sand the top of te blade so it's not actually sharp. You may omit this step if you are preparing for a real battle. Also, sand the edges up six inches from the pommel; this will be your grip, so you don't want the edges digging in. And while you're at it, just sand the entire sword. Nothing ruins a good arm slash like leftover splinters. When you sand everything in coarse grit, do a good run down on the finest grit you can get, and blow off the resulting sand-powder.

, Now don't just stand there, get back to work, Lancelot. It's time to lacquer those beauty(s) with Instant Drying Lacquer (it should be in a spray can.) Go outside, and apply a good 4 coats, waiting at least 15 minutes between coats. Don't cheat here, this stuff could save your precious weapons from unsightly scratches. And don't wimp out; your lungs could always use a good lacquering, too. Or wear a mask.

, Spray the blades with silver, down to (and a little past) the 6-inch-from-the-pommel mark. Spray your hilt pieces with gold, along with the little nub which will be your pommel. Be careful not to get gold on your silver! A minimum of 2 coats will give you that threatening-shiny look you've always wanted.

, Once you've done that (and everything is dry) grab your hilt pieces, one for each side of the sword and nail them in with 16x3/4"" nails, in a criss-cross pattern (that means two diagonal on one side, and do the opposite diagonal from the other side.)

, You will need a different piece of tape for that last circle, because it will be mathematically impossible to make it end evenly. But you'll try this anyway.)

, But if you were hiding behind a rock this time, waiting for battle, now is a good time to run out and give your war call. Quick!

This screen shows the newest released set: Shadows over Innistrad (SOI), which will be used as an example in this guide.


From here, you can view the set in its entirety and read the cards and their effects, and look for bombs, or threats that can win games.;
, Once you give the set an initial look over, start identifying color combinations that are supported by the cards in the set. Magic has 5 different colors of mana, white, blue, black, red, and green; these different colors of mana are used to cast different colors cards. In a drafting environment, players are will usually not be able to obtain enough playable cards in a single color. In most cases, draft decks will consist of 2, or even 3 color combinations of cards, so is important to know what colors work well together in the Set. In order to do this, there are 2 simple ways to identify what colors are designed to work together in a set: non-basic land cards and gold, or multi-colored, cards within the set.


Above you see a gold card: Olivia, Mobilized for War, and a matching non-basic land: Foreboding Ruins. From the information on these cards, you can see that red and black is a supported color combination in SOI, since there is a card that requires both those colors, as well as a land that can produce both those colors in the set.

, Once you identify your color pair, you can expand further into the archetypes of the set. Archetypes are important, because certain cards that fit in the same archetypes are designed to have synergy. When 2 cards with synergy are put in a a deck together, the deck becomes more powerful than just a sum of its individual parts. If you read deeper into Olivia, Mobilized for War, you can see that she is a vampire, and has a mechanic that allows you to discard cards.


Looking at the black and red cards in the set, you can see other vampires, as well a mechanic called madness in the cards such as Falkenrath Gorger. Madness allows you to cast spells for cheaper, or with an extra effect when you discard the card, which work perfectly with Olivia's effect. The enchantment, Call the Bloodline, is another way to enable madness as well as create more vampires, while lightning axe provides cheap removal on top of allowing you to discard cards. From these cards, you have identified your archetype: Red/Black madness vampires. There are multiple archetypes in each of the different colors for any draft format. Since drafting packs has a high level of randomness, its good to take a look at a few archetypes, in case you never see any of the cards you planned on using for your original plan.

, Once you identify your archetype, you must consider deck composition. Every functional deck needs to follow 5 basic principles to succeed on a fundamental level: card advantage, removal, creature count, mana base, and mana curve.


Mana base is referring to your lands, such as the Foreboding Ruins you saw earlier, as well as mana accelerants. Picking these up will help prevent you from not being able to cast the spells you want to.
Mana curve refers to picking up cards that are costed differently. This allows you to potentially drop spells on every turn, a 1-drop on turn 1, and 2-drop on turn-2 etc. also known as curving out.
The most important card type in any draft are generally creatures. These cards are the ones that will protect your life total, as well as knock down your opponents' life totals and allow you to win. Making sure to pick up efficient creatures at different mana costs is instrumental to building a good draft deck.
Removal refers to cards that can remove you opponents creatures. Removal is important to answer your opponents bombs, as being unable to deal with your opponents' big creatures can easily result in a loss. Different colors remove creatures in different ways. For example, red generally uses damage to outright kill creatures, as seen in your Lightning Axe card from earlier.
Card advantage refers to ways to draw cards. Having access to more cards means you can keep casting spells. Once you run out of cards, its difficult to keep up with your opponents moves, so keeping hand count up is crucial to closing out games.
Now that you know what card you need, look at the set and try to find cards that fulfill your needs as well as fit into your archetype. Corrupted Grafstone is a mana accelerant that works off your graveyard, which works well with discarding cards. Insolent Neonate and Asylum Visitor are vampire creatures that are 1 and 2-drops respectively, which can lets you drop them early and then curve into Olivia on turn 3 in an ideal situation. Tormented Voice is an excellent card that fills the dual purpose of refilling your hand, while also allowing you to discard for madness.

, Another important factor to deck building is composition.


In general draft decks are built from a minimum for 40 cards, are comprised of:

15-17 Creatures
6-9 Non-creature spells: sorceries, instants, enchantments, artifacts
16-17 Lands


Depending on your archetype, these numbers may differ slightly, but this serves as a good base.

, The mechanics of drafting boil down to 2 things, picking and passing. From each pack, players will pick one card and then pass that pack. The process for passing packs is pass to left for pack 1, pass to the right for pack 2, and then pass to the left again for pack 3.

, In every pack of magic cards, there is a spread of 1 rare, 3 uncommons, and 11 commons with a chance for an extra foil card. When evaluating a pack, the first card you want to consider is the rare. Cards at the rare level are often stronger in comparison to lower cards, and there are less of them in the draft since there is only 1 per pack. In some cases however, you will want to forsake the rare in favor of another pick, such as when the rare only functions in very specific situations or niche decks.


When evaluating cards, there are 2 factors to take into consideration: power and versatility. Some cards are extremely powerful, but require you to have other cards, or to build your deck in a certain way in order to function. Other cards have high versatility, and can function in a variety of situations, but sacrifice raw power. For creatures, a good test of strength is seeing power and toughness vs mana cost. creatures that pass the test have power and toughness equal to their cost, for example, a 4/4 for 4 mana. Another thing to consider is synergy with your previous picks. Sometimes, taking picks with high raw power early constrains you to make certain picks later in order to keep your deck balanced.

,


The first pack in the draft can set the stage for entire deck, depending on what kind of pick you take first. Take this pack for example; in this pack, you are extremely lucky to have pulled 2 rares, because your pack contained a foil rare. On the left you have Sorin, Grim Nemesis who is an extremely powerful pick from this set. On the left, you have Tamiyo's Journal which isnt quite as strong, but is still an excellent rare in the draft, and provides card advantage which is a core function that every deck needs. When comparing the 2, Sorin is a winner in terms of power, but Tamiyo's Journal leaves you with all options open. Since this is the first pick of the draft, taking Sorin here will heavily influence you into taking black and white cards to build around him, where as the journal allows you to go in any direction you want based on the next few picks.

, Say you take Sorin as your first pick. Sorin is a 6 drop, which is pretty high, so you must find picks that will allow you to survive the early game and play your Sorin later. In drafting, 6 mana cost is fine to top out a curve, and you don't want to get too many high cost spells, lest you are unable to play any of your very expensive cards. Now what you need is some 1-5 drops so you have some plays in the early turns, and your opponents don't form an insurmountable lead before you can play you bomb (Sorin).

, Now that you know your own game plan, what are the other players around the table doing? this question can be answered be paying attention to what kinds of cards are being passed to you. Is there a good rare in a certain color passed to you on turn 2-3? Chances are the players on the side passing to you are not building those colors. Inversely, what is missing from the pack? If you never see any red or black cards, chance are there is high competition around the table to pick those colors.


Identifying what your opponents are doing can help you build a better deck by going into an archetype that not many players are drafting, which will let you pick up more pieces of the deck and build a deck that has more synergy.

, Sometimes, you have to abandon your first pick and change your plans completely. In the example, you were extremely lucky with the rares you opened, however, this might not be the case. Maybe instead of opening that game-winning bomb in your first pick, you open it in your second pack, after a whole round of drafting has already occurred. In this case, it might be worth it to abandon some of your earlier picks than to pass along a strong card just because it didn't fit into your original plan.


Splashing is a less extreme way to alter your plans. Say you were planning to build our R/B madness vampires but picked Sorin pack 1 pick 1. Sorin is Black and White, while the deck you are trying to build is black and red. However, due to Sorin's high power, you want to try and run him in your deck. Splashing refers to running Sorin in our Red/Black deck and including a couple white mana sources in order to accommodate him. These 2 dual lands allows you to tap for one of your mains colors (black/red) as well as providing a white source to cast Sorin.

, As you enter the late stages of the draft, look at the cards you have accumulated. Think back to when you were thinking about balancing a deck and deck composition and ask yourself some questions.


How is your curve looking?
What are your different spell counts?
Do you have the basic principles needed to make your deck function?
What cards have you already picked?
Based on the answers to these question, fill in the holes in your deck and really round it out.

, There are times, especially when you get down to the last picks in a pack, when you get passed a pack that has no good choices for you. In this situation, use information on what your opponents are doing. If you have identified what kinds of colors your opponents are in, you can take cards that they might need so you don't have to deal with those cards.

, Once you have drafted your entire pool, its time to put your deck together. The first thing you want to do is get organized, so take all your playable picks and layout your curve. Laying out your curve refers to sorting out your cards by mana cost. 1-mana cards together, 2-mana cards together, etc. Once you lay out your curve, count out how many cards you have. Your deck should aim to have 23-24 non-land cards, so you will have to make some cuts to get it down to size.

, Making cuts is based on a few criteria.


First and foremost is power. Some cards are simply more powerful than others, and demand a spot in a deck. With cards on either extreme of the power spectrum, you can easily decide what you definitely want to keep and what you want to cut. However, power alone is generally not enough to make all the cuts you need to make.
Next you will consider your ideal curve, and try to make your deck conform to that. In general, a deck's curve should roughly resemble a bell curve, with low counts of cards that are extremely expensive or too cheap, and higher quantities in the mid range(2-4 mana) If you have too many cards in at any one cost, look to make cuts there.
Finally is redundancy. If you have multiple cards that fulfill the same purpose within the deck, or even multiple copies of some commons, this is where you will make your final cuts.

, Once you have your cuts, its time to fill in your 16-17 land slots. This is done by counting up your cards of different colors. The ratio of basic lands should roughly match the ratio of the colors you are running. For example, if you are running 16 red cards and 8 black cards, your mana base should be approximately 10 mountains (red) and 6 swamps (black). This is also where you will utilize any lands that produce multiple colors that you picked up form the draft, in general you should look to replace the higher count lands with your dual lands.

Stick the two together, but make sure you leave sticky edges on both side so you can stick it onto the back of the shield.,
Position it on the bottom left side of the shield if you are right handed, and if you're left handed, put it on the bottom, right side of the shield.

,
Repeat number 14, only make the duct tape pieces smaller, because this will be where you grip the shield.

,
Stick this on the corner diagonal from the arm rest.

,
Reinforce the grip and rest with smaller pieces of duct tape, so they won't come off when you are swinging the shield around.

, Real ninja swords were short, allowing them to fight it close combat and move more easily. A good rule of thumb is for the blade to be the same length as the distance from your elbow to the tips of your fingers. Just be sure to leave an extra 4-8"" for the handle on the end.

, Shave off the bark using a knife or whittling tools. If you are using a dowel rod, this will not be needed.

, Using a knife or whittling tools, carve the sword blade into the shape you want. Point the tip and add some curve if you want to, but real ninja swords probably had little curve and an angled point.

, Use some extra tape to really seal the hand guard to the main part of the sword.

, You can make your sword look even cooler if you want to, by painting the blade silver. Use tape and newspaper to protect your handle and then use silver metallic spray paint to paint the blade. Do this outside. When it's done drying, enjoy your new sword!

Get your materials.,
Make your template.,
Roughly cut out your sword.,
File it into shape.,
Bevel the edge.,
Create the handle.,
Wrap the handle.",How to Make a Ninja Sword2," You'll need a sheet of 1/4"" flat stock aluminum, a band saw or jigsaw, a metal file, a piece of plywood, a 1-1.5"" diameter dowel rod, electrical tape or ribbon, and metal glue or epoxy.

, Draw a template onto paper or cardstock to get the outline of the sword blade you want. Leave a straight portion at the bottom for the handle, about 1-1.5"" wide.

, Trace your template onto the sheet of aluminum using a Sharpie or other marker. Then, cut it out using a band or jigsaw. Be careful: you want to cut the metal not your fingers. When making this cut, you want to get as close to your outline as possible without actually cutting along the line.

, Clamp your sword in place and then use a file to get the edge of the metal down to your outline. A metal grinder will make this job faster.

, Using the file, bevel the edge of the blade to get that ""cutting"" edge. You don't want it to be too sharp though: then you can't play with it.

, Cut a square, oval, or circular hand guard from the plywood, cutting an extra gap at the center that you can fit your blade through. Paint the guard black. Next, using the saw, cut the dowel rod in half so that you get to half circles. You want to use a dowel rod that is the same size as the handle you cut out. One half will go on each side of the handle, creating a round surface for you to hold. You can use the metal glue or epoxy to secure the pieces in place.


Use a little clear caulk to secure the blade side of the handle guard once the dowels are in place.

, Using the electrical tape or wide ribbon, wrap the handle until the whole thing is covered. You can wrap it in a basic spiral, or you can try to do the decorative wrapping of real Japanese swords. Enjoy your new sword!

Open your pack and discard the instruction and Joker cards. Before you start dealing, shuffle the cards a couple of times to make sure that the deck is all mixed up.;
, Deal the first card and place it face up on your left-hand side. Then, deal six more cards face-down in a row to the right of this card so that each card has its own spot.


When you are finished, you should have seven cards total. The first one on the left should be facing up and the other six should be facing down.
The cards that you are dealing are called your “Tableau.” These are the main cards that you will use to play solitaire.When you are finished dealing all of the cards, your Tableau will look similar to an upside down staircase.

, Next, you will need to deal six more cards onto the stacks. Place the first card face up on the second stack of cards from the left. Then, deal one card face down card onto each of the stacks moving to the right., Starting with the third stack over from the left, deal one card face up. Then, deal four more cards facing down on each of the stacks to the right of this stack., Starting with the fourth stack over from the left, deal one card face up onto this stack and then deal three cards facing down. Place one card onto each of the stacks to the right of this stack., Count over to the fifth card from the left in your row of seven card stacks. Deal one card facing up on this stack and then deal one card facing down onto each of the two stacks to the right., Next, count over to the sixth stack from the left and deal one card facing up onto this stack. Then, deal one card facing down onto the stack to the right of this stack. This stack should be the last one in your row of seven., There should only be one stack left that does not have a face up card on it. This stack should be all the way on the right of your Tableau. Deal one card onto this stack facing up. Now this stack should have six cards facing down and one on top that is facing up.After you have dealt this last card, your Tableau is complete! Dealing the Tableau is the hardest part of setting up solitaire, so the next part will be easy.

, After you have finished setting up your stacks, you can place the cards that you have left just above the Tableau on the left-hand side. This will be your “Stock” or “Hand” pile. You will draw cards from this pile as you play the game.If you want to be extra sure that the cards are shuffled, then you can shuffle them again before placing your Stock pile. This is optional though.

, The discard pile, also known as the “Talon” or “Waste” pile, is where you will discard any cards that you draw and cannot use.At the start of your game, the Talon pile will be empty. Reserve a space next to your Stock pile to create your Talon pile during gameplay.


The Talon pile is usually just to the right of the Stock pile.
When you have exhausted your Talon pile, you can flip it over (face down) onto the Stock pile space again and continue playing.

, The Foundation piles are where you will place the cards that you will clear from the Tableau stacks as you play solitaire. At the start of your game, your Foundation piles will be empty, so you just need to reserve some space above your Tableau. Leave enough room to place four stacks of cards as you play., If you have never played solitaire before, then you will need to take a few minutes to learn how to play solitaire first. The object of a game of Solitaire is to transfer all of the cards in the deck and in the tableau stacks to your foundation piles.You begin the game with nothing in these piles and arrange cards in these stacks going from lowest to highest and separated by suit.For example, one stack might begin with the ace of spades, so only the two of spades can be placed in this stack next. You cannot place the three of spades until the two of spades is in place.

, You will need to draw and place cards to play. Draw one card at a time and either play it on one of your stacks or discard it if you cannot use it. You can play a card on one of your tableau stacks if the color and sequence are right.The colors need to alternate between red and black.


For example, if one stack has a five of hearts on it and you draw a four of clubs, then you could play the four of clubs on the five of hearts.

, You can move cards between stacks to expose face-down cards. When a face down card is exposed, then you can flip it over and use it.


For example, if one stack has a five of hearts on it and another stack has a six of spades on it, then you could move the five of hearts to the six of spades stack. This will expose a face-down card that you can then flip over and either leave it in place or use it.

, When you have exhausted the discard pile, then you can flip over the stack and begin using those cards again. Continue to draw one card at a time and to flip the deck each time you go through it.

, As you expose cards and draw cards, you will be able to transfer them to the foundation piles above your tableau stacks. Remember that each pile needs to begin with an ace card and there should only be one stack per suit.When each stack contains an ace through king set, then you will have won the game!

Prepare your shield for display.",How to Make a Roman Style Shield," Pick a shape for your shield using images of Roman shields for inspiration. The most iconic scutums were rectangular with rounded edges, though circular and oval shields were used as well. The basic rectangular shield will probably be the best place to start—keep in mind that it will be more difficult to cut complex shapes and curved edges., You'll need a single large sheet of cardboard to cut out the body of your shield. The cardboard should ideally be flat, so that the shield doesn't accidentally contain any part of the hinged box top, and big enough to cut out your shield in a single piece. Finding an unused cardboard shipping or appliance container may be your best best, or you can sometimes find measured single sheets of cardboard at craft stores.If you're having trouble finding a piece of cardboard big enough, check with some local businesses to see if they have any to give away. Places like post offices and grocery stores are often happy to get rid of surplus boxes.A refrigerator box would make an ideal base for the rectangular, body-length Roman shield.

, Use a pencil to sketch out the desired shape of your shield on the cardboard. Make the outline slightly larger than the actual size you want your shield to be if you wish to fold and secure the edges later for a cleaner, more rounded finish. Go over the outline with a dark felt-tipped marker so that it's more visible when you begin cutting.If you'd rather, if you can sketch the outline of your shield onto a separate piece of posterboard or scrap of newspaper first, then cut this out and use it to trace around the cardboard for a more precise shape.
To account for the folded edges of your shield, draw two concentric outlines on the cardboard, one about 2"" larger around the smaller outline. You'll cut out the shield at the outer outline and fold it to the inner one.

, Use an X-acto knife, box cutter or other straight cutting implement to cut out the outline of your shield. Go slowly and try to make the edges as precise as possible. Make sure you lay the cardboard on a surface safe for cutting, such as a crafting table.Take extreme caution when handling any cutting tool. Straight cutters are designed to be very sharp, and accidents can happen if you're not careful. Always cut in short, smooth motions and go slowly.
You can use scissors if you have no other option, but the blades are not as sharp, and the pressure of them against the cardboard may cause it to crush and cut poorly.

, Once you've cut out your basic shield shape, make another small cut of about 2"" at each corner of the shield, or at intervals of around half a foot if you're creating a circular shield. Making these cuts will create ""flaps"" that you can then fold and tape down on the backside of the shield, giving the shield a thicker, rounded appearance.Remember to cut the outline of your shield several inches larger if you decide to fold the edges of the cardboard.

, Using the cardboard you have remaining, cut out a thin rectangular section to serve as the handle on the backside of the shield. This piece should be 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) long and 2-3 inches wide to make sure that it's sturdy enough to stay in place. Bend the rectangular strip so that the handle is squared, with a short flap on either side to tape down against the shield. Use duct tape or another strong adhesive to attach the handle to the shield.If you wish, you can cut a second strip of cardboard to serve as a forearm strap, which will brace the shield against the forearm and allow you to control it better.

, To make the body of the wooden shield, you’ll need a single large wood board; the size and type of wood you use will depend largely on preference, although it was standard for the Roman shield to be about a foot shorter than its wielder and a few inches wider on either side. You can usually have wood cut to your specifications at home improvement stores like The Home Depot. Plywood is a cheaper option and will be useful if you intend to pad the shield for use in role playing activities.Assuming you don’t want to spend the money to have a piece of wood cut specifically for your shield, you can visit a lumber yard or recycling center to salvage unused scrap wood for little or no cost.
If you’re unable to find a wood board large enough, piece together one of the right size using smaller individual pieces, like planks from a wooden pallet.

, Find handle that can be used to provide a grip for the back of the shield. A basic door handle, like those used on screened doors, will probably be your cheapest and most readily available option.You could also use a thick strip of leather, in addition to the handle, to craft a forearm strap. Make sure you have a set of wood screws and a basic screwdriver to attach the handle to the shield.A plain metal handle will look best in keeping with the appearance of the shield.
Scrap leather can usually be bought in craft stores, or online. Cut the leather to the exact size you want for the strap.You will only need two wood screws, unless you decide to attach a leather forearm strap as well, in which case four will do the job.

, Before you begin putting together the individual components of the shield, quickly inspect the wood board you’re using for any imperfections. Splinters, cracks and uneven places can all compromise the integrity of the shield, and if untreated they can leave the shield with a rough, unappealing appearance. Take whatever measures necessary to ensure that the wood is smooth and symmetrical.


Cracks or breaks in your wood board can be sealed using Epoxy., Place the handle where you want it to go on the shield’s back side. Centering the handle will give the shield the best balance and leverage for movement, but it can also go slightly to one side or the other if it suits your personal preference. Use a pencil to mark where the screws should go in the handle.


Allow room for a strap. If you wish to add a leather forearm strap in addition to the handle, account for this in the layout on the back of the shield. Measure the distance from the thickest part of the forearm to the palm. If you’re right-handed (which means you would carry the shield in your left hand), place the strap and handle the appropriate distance from one another in the center of the shield with the handle on the right. If you’re left-handed, reverse this configuration.To center the handle and strap together, take a measurement of the total width of the shield and subtract your forearm-to-hand measurement from that, then divide this number in half to tell how you how much space you should have remaining on either side of the strap and handle once they’re attached.

, Line the handle up with the markings you made for where the screws should go on the back of the shield. Hold the handle still (or tape it down, if necessary) while you insert a wood screw into the top hole in the handle and screw it into place. Do the same for the bottom hole, tightening both screws and making sure they’re both straight and secure.


If you’re bolting the handle to the wood, use the paddle bit to bore about half an inch into the wood, then drill the rest of the way through and insert the bolt. Tighten with the socket head bit.Plywood and other lightweight pieces will likely be too thin to bolt successfully.

, Use craft paint (or acrylic paint if you're making a wooden shield) to brush an authentic Roman design onto your shield. Scour the internet or reference books on Roman military history to find inspiration for emblems and ornamentation. Some popular design elements are wings, griffins and leaf-like patterns.Print a template off the internet and make it a guide for a stencil you can use to spray paint your design on for a clean finish.Create your own original design in the same style as traditional Roman weapon-works for a personalized shield.
Use painter’s tape to help you paint precise lines and edges.

, Once you’ve got your shield assembled and painted, apply a thin coat of clear lacquer to the front side of the shield. This will protect both the wood and paint from smearing, cracking and peeling as a result of wear or water damage, as well as giving the shield a gleaming, polished finish. If you’re making a padded shield, skip the lacquer and finish with a layer of clear acrylic primer.When applying lacquer or any chemical gloss, be sure to do so in an open, well-ventilated area, and wear a face mask if possible.

, For role playing activities, weapons and armor typically have to be approved for safe use. In this scenario, you’ll need to apply a layer of foam padding to the shield so that the wooden surface is not exposed. Cut 1” wide strips of foam and glue them in a grid pattern the length and height of your shield, then glue a solid sheet of foam over the top. Draw the design of the shield directly onto the foam using acrylic paint.To increase the safety of your shield for recreational use, add a few strips of foam around the inner edge of the shield (the side you’ll be on while holding it) to pad it against your own body.

, You’re finished! You now have a solid, handmade replica Roman shield to wear to your next costume party or proudly show off. To mount your shield for display, attach a short length of framing wire to the back side of the shield and use a couple wall mounting hooks to hang it. Use your shield to adorn a bare section of wall in your home, or take a padded shield out for a spin at your next LARP event.If you plan to use your shield when it’s not being displayed, find a place to attach the framing wire where it won’t interfere with your grip.

",How to Play Solitaire1," It is to create four piles of cards - one per suit - in ascending order (beginning with Ace and ending with King.







;
, Put down one card face up and lay six cards face down next to it. Then, put one card face up on top (but lowered slightly) of the first face down card, then put a face down card on top of the other five cards. Continue doing this, so that each pile has one face up card on top and so that the left pile has one card, the next has two, then three, four, five, six, and finally seven.







, This pile is where you will go to get more cards if you run out of moves.

Deal 10 piles of cards out in a horizontal line.,
Deal another card, face up, on each of the 10 piles.,
Set the rest of the combined decks aside, face down.,
Build sequences of cards in descending order by doing the following:


Move any face-up card onto a card with the next-highest value in the deck, regardless of suit.,
Turn face-down cards face-up as they become uncovered.,
Use the stock when you run out of moves.,
Remove King-through-Ace sequences from play as you succeed in creating them.",How to Play Spider Solitaire1," For this, don't take any cards out (apart from the jokers) -- just look past the suits and pretend they're all the same. Otherwise you'd need way more decks!;
, Each card should be face down and vertically oriented. Each of the first 4 piles should contain 5 cards, and the last 6 piles should each contain 4 cards.

, The first 4 piles should now contain a total of 6 cards (with the uppermost card face up) and the last 6 piles should now contain a total of 5 cards (uppermost card face up).

, This pile is known as the ""stock."" You'll be drawing from it when you run out of moves on your tableau.

, For example, a Queen of any suit can go on top of a King of any suit; a 7 of any suit can go on top of an 8 of any suit.
Place each new card slightly lower than the card you're playing it on, so you can still see the value and suit of each previously played card.
You can move the card closest to you in each face up stack to another stack at your convenience. You can only move several face-up cards together if they're all in descending order. For example, the K-Q-J-10-9 or 5-4-3 (of any suit) can be moved together as a single unit.

, You cannot leave any piles unturned (why would you want to?). Once you deplete all the cards from a particular pile, you can fill the empty space with any face-up card or descending sequence of suited cards.


You cannot use the stockpile if you have any empty columns to fill. Simply take a card (or a bunch) from a stack and place it in the empty column.

, If you're looking at your tableau and you don't see anything you can possibly do, turn to your stock. Deal one card face-up from the stock onto each of the 10 card stacks, then continue play.


When you run out of stock cards to add and can't do anything, wah wah. Game over. Playing with one suit is fairly doable, but when you hit two and four it becomes rather difficult.

, Set them aside face-up. When you have 8, you're finished!


Take care to keep the completed sequences separate from the stockpile you set aside after the initial deal.
Play ends when you've succeeded in creating all 8 ""builds,"" or suited King-through-Ace sequences, or when no more moves are possible.

,
If you use all the cards in one of the seven piles, you may place a king (but only a king) in the empty space.









",How to Play Solitaire2," If there are any aces, place them above the seven piles. If there are no aces, rearrange the cards you have, moving only the face up cards. When you place a card on top (slightly lower so that you can still see both cards), it must be a different color than the card you are placing it on top of and have a value of one less. Thus, if you have a six of hearts, you can either place a five of spades or a five of clubs on top.








Keep placing the cards on top of each other until you cannot move anymore.
Each pile should be alternating in color and move in descending order.

, The card on top of each of the seven piles should be face up. If you move a card, remember to turn the card underneath it over.









, If you have an ace above your cards, (eventually you should have all four aces there), you may move cards of the place cards of the corresponding suit on top of the pile in ascending (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K) order.









, Flip over the top three cards, and see if the top one can be placed anywhere. Much of the time, there will an ace in there! If you put down the top card, see if you can put down the next. If you put down the second card, see if you can put down the last card. Then, if you put down the last card, put down another three cards from the reserve deck. If you cannot make a move with any of these cards, put them in a separate waste stack (taking care not to disturb the order). Repeat until your reserve deck has run out.










Once your reserve deck runs out, use the waste stack. However, make sure that you do not shuffle it!

Like Forty Thieves, there are four spaces placed above the rows that are used as reserve spaces. You can only play the top card of each pile, but you can place the top card into one of the reserve spaces so that you can play a card beneath it.

, This is a variation of solitaire where the object is to play all of the cards placed face up in the seven piles, rather than create four suit stacks.


Deal out seven piles with five cards in each. All of the cards should be face up. All of the other cards should be placed face down in the reserve deck.
Flip over the top card of the reserve deck. You will then try to play any of the face up cards from the seven piles on the card you have flipped from the reserve deck. When you cannot play any more cards, flip the next reserve deck card over and play any face up cards you can off of this new card. Continue playing until you have either played all of the face up cards or you cannot make any more moves.

, The object of the game is to remove all of the cards in the pyramid and reserve pile and place them in the discard pile by creating pairs that equal 13 in point value.Deal out 28 cards into the shape of a pyramid, face up. It should be stacked so that the rows are made of one card, then two cards, then three cards, etc. until all 28 cards have been placed in the pyramid. Each row should overlap the row above it. Note that some people play that you only use 21 cards to make the pyramid.
Create a reserve pile with the left over cards.
Remove cards one at a time or in pairs. You can only remove cards that have a value of 13. Kings are 13 points, queens 12, jacks 11 and the rest of the cards represent their face values (aces are 1.) For example, you could remove a king; you could also remove an 8 and 5, because they add up to 13. The top card of the reserve deck can also be used to make 13.
If no cards can be made into pairs, the next reserve card is flipped over. Once all of the reserve cards have run out, you can take them from the discard pile and return them to the reserve pile so you can keep removing cards from the pyramid.

, You must use two decks to play spider solitaire.Make 10 piles, four piles should have six cards each, and six piles should have five cards each. Only the top card of each pile should be facing up. The rest of the cards are placed in the reserve deck.
The goal is to creating descending card sequences of the same suit from King to Ace within the 10 piles. Once you have completed one descending pile, you can place it in one of the eight foundation squares. You must make a descending order stack eight times. You cannot use the foundation squares as holding spaces for cards.
You can create mini stacks (such as 9, 8, 7 of spades) and place them on a 10 of hearts or any other suit while you make other small stacks.
The game ends when all eight foundation squares are filled.

Shuffle the deck.,
Deal a single card face up.,
Make a new row with two more cards partially on top of the first.,
Keep adding rows until you've dealt 28 cards total.,
Place the remaining cards stacked face up and to the side.",How to Play Pyramid Solitaire1," Pyramid solitaire is typically played with a standard 52-card deck. Because suits don't matter in pyramid solitaire, a well-shuffled deck isn't vital for a good game, even with a brand new pack of cards.;
, This card will be the ""top"" of your pyramid tableau. In solitaire, a tableau is the large central layout and the main source for free cards. Unlike many other forms of solitaire, the pyramid tableau is completely face up., Place the two cards face up and side by side. Each of the two new cards should cover one lower quarter of the first card. The three cards should create a horizontally symmetrical triangle, Each additional row will have one more card than the one underneath it. The pyramid tableau is seven cards tall and has a base seven cards.If your pyramid has a different number of rows or is not horizontally symmetrical, go backwards to figure out where you may have made a mistake while dealing.

, This stack of cards is called your stock. The stock should be neatly stacked so that only the top card is visible. Once the pyramid is fully formed and you've set your stock aside, you're ready to begin playing."
"
Shuffle the deck well.,
Flip over the top card of the stockpile to begin and place the card face-up next to it.,
Continue moving cards from the tableau into the foundation until there are no more playable cards in it.,
Know when you've won or lost this round of Golf Solitaire.",How to Play Golf Solitaire," Then, create seven columns of five cards. The columns should be evenly spaced, and the cards in each column should overlap each other so that the bottom card in each column in the only card not overlapped. After the columns (tableau) are situated, place the remaining cards in a face-down pile below the tableau. This is called the stockpile.;
, The foundation or waste pile has just been created. The object of the game is to move a card from the tableau to the foundation that is not overlapped by any card and is at least one more or one less than the foundation card's face value. If you've played TriPeaks Solitaire before, this game is so similar, it's virtually the same style only this game has only one peak and no cards overlap each other - they are in vertical-straight line overlaps. Aces can be counted as either the lowest numbered card in the deck or the highest number on-top of the King.

, When there are no more playable cards in the tableau, flip cards over from the stockpile and into the foundation until there are playable cards in the tableau again. The game continues until either the tableau or the stockpile runs out of cards.

, When the tableau runs out of cards, it is considered a win, but if the stockpile runs out of cards before the tableau, it is considered a loss.

"
"
Deal out your cards in the same fashion as you would with the one-suit version.,
Think in reds and blacks.,
Move clusters of the same color.,
Know that the rest of the rules apply.",How to Play Spider Solitaire2," You're using the same amount of cards in the same format. That's piles of 5 on the right and piles of 6 on the left (turned-up card included). The stock is the same, too.


If you're unsure as to what that fashion is, read up on the one-suit version. It's much easier and every new player should start with it.

, Instead of completely ignoring the suits, this time you're just going to lump them by color. That is, hearts and diamonds are ""one suit"" and clubs and spades are another.

, For the one suit version, you just needed to make numerical sequences (7-8-9, for example). Now you can still make those sequences, but you can only move them in chunks if they're the same color. That is, you can put a 7 of hearts on an 8 of spades, but you can't move them together.


You could, however, move a 7 of hearts and an 8 of hearts (or diamonds). This adds a considerable level of difficulty to the game.

, The rest of the game is the same, regardless of whether you're playing one suit, two suit, or the four suit version. You still use the stock when you have no moves to make, you still have to turn over face down cards when they're open, and you still have to have cards in every pile before you can use the stock.


And the format is the same, too. Same amount of cards, same amount of piles. If you skipped method one, you may wish to refer to it. What's more, if you're new to Spider Solitaire, definitely start with one suit -- it's much, much easier!
Again, the only difference is how you move the clusters, not how you make them. So be very careful when you move that red card onto that black card -- you may not be able to get to that black card for a while!

"
"
Deal out the cards in the same manner.,
Recognize all the suits.,
Move them in uniform clusters.,
Utilize strategy.",How to Play Spider Solitaire3," Four Suit Spider Solitaire is intense, but it's the exact same in format and play. Use the same amount of cards, use the same set-up, and use the same basic rules for winning.

, This time, you're seeing the suits for what they are. Diamonds are diamonds, spades are spades, etc. Just like in the two-suit version, they must be played together. In order to get King-to-Ace sequences cleared off the table, they must all be of the same suit.

, You can make any numerical sequences you'd like (6-7-8-9, etc.), but they can only be moved within their suit. A six of hearts on a 7 of spades on an 8 of diamonds is going nowhere. However, a six of hearts on a 7 of hearts on an 8 of diamonds? The 6 and 7 can be moved.


See how this gets virtually impossible? When you're moving the cards around, you're going to have to know which allowances to make and which moves to avoid. In general, you want to open piles and rows -- if the move doesn't do that, you may be best off skipping it.

, The four-suit version is really the only version where it's strategy over all (not ignoring luck). To make your sequences and clear them off the board (which is how you win the game), you gotta be very careful.


Go for higher ranked cards first. In other words, move the Jack onto the Queen before you move the 10 onto the Jack. If you move a 10 onto a Jack that's a different suit, you're virtually killing it.
Move Kings to open columns as soon as you can.
Get cards off of columns that are almost empty. The sooner you get empty columns, the sooner you can get your Kings off the column and off the table.
Though it should go without saying, try your best to keep sequences within a suit. As the game progresses, you'll be glad you did.

"
Place three cards into separate piles.,
Start to form your pyramids.,
Set up the fourth row of cards.,
Turn one card in the stock pile over.,
Look at the card’s number.,
Check the suit and color.,
Turn over cards as they become available.,
Turn over a card from the waste pile when needed.,
Play until you win or get stuck.",How to Play TriPeaks Solitaire," These will be the start of your “peaks” or mountain-ranges, which will then interconnect at their bases. Keep in mind that you want to form the piles with cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. However, make sure to remove all Jokers from the pack before starting.


Be sure to keep the cards turned over so you can’t see what they are.
You should have 28 cards laid out by the end.;
, From the first card at the top, place two down (back side up), and then three more below them - forming a pyramid. You also want to make sure the cards touch the corners of the cards above them, though you can also layer over them. However, at the base, make sure the three pyramids do not touch each other.

, This last level should interconnect the ""peaks"" or pyramids together. You will want to have four for each set, so 12 altogether. These are also the only cards you should turn over.


Any remaining cards can be placed in a stockpile to the side, which will be used later.

, Like in normal solitaire, this stock or ""waste"" pile determines which cards are next playable. However, rather than placing cards from the stock pile onto cards in pyramids, you will be taking cards from the pyramids and placing them onto the stock pile. The goal is to uncover and remove all the cards from the pyramids/peaks., The only cards you can move to the waste pile are those that are one number above or one number below the card on the stock pile. For example, if the card on the waste pile is a King of Spades, then you can only move a Queen or Ace to that pile.However, keep in mind that the Ace can be either a card above the King or a card below the 2, depending on how you’re playing.

, When moving cards from the card peak to place on the waste pile, the suit or color don’t matter. Different from regular solitaire, you can place a red diamond on a black spade or vice versa. The only thing that matters is that the numbers are consistent.

, When both of the cards that border a card have been moved, you can turn that card over. For example, if you remove every card in the fourth row of a pyramid, then you can turn over every one of the cards in the third row. Just keep in mind that if a card is still bordered or “pinned” by other cards, it can’t be moved.

, If you have reached an impasse with no playable cards from the pyramid and stock pile, then you can turn over a new card. You can do this as many times as you need to move cards from the pyramids. However, if you run through the whole stock pile, then you will have to start repeating cards again.

, Games are won when all the cards inside your peaks/pyramids have been placed into the waste pile. This means that all your playable cards have been completed. If the stockpile has been cleaned of cards while the pyramids still have cards, though, then the game has been lost.

,How to Play Solitaire4,
"
Find pairs of free cards that add up to 13.,
Check for blocks.,
Move the top stock card to the waste.,
Feel free to match between the stock and the waste.,
Continue the game until one of the two end conditions are met.",How to Play Pyramid Solitaire2," Place matched cards in a separate discard pile. This is the fundamental move in pyramid solitaire.


Cards are only considered free when no other card is on top of them.
Ace is low in this game and has a value of 1.
Face cards are assigned special values: Jacks are 11, Queens are 12, and Kings are 13.
Kings do not need a second card to form a match. Any free Kings can be removed on their own at any time., A certain percentage of hands are unwinnable, and learning to recognize them will save you some frustration. The main thing to look for are instances where all four of a particular card are part of a tableau below one or more of their matches.


For example, if the very top of your pyramid is an ace and you have two Queens in your bottom row, one in your sixth row, and one in your fourth row, you have an unwinnable hand. At least one Queen is inherently impossible to match, making the top ace unreachable.Many computerized versions of pyramid solitaire weed out the unwinnable games for you.

, The waste is a second stack of cards that is essentially the stock in reverse. Like the stock, the cards are oriented face up and the top card is free. You don't have to be stuck without a match to do this. In fact, it's prudent to move a playable card to the waste first. Doing so may reveal a second playable card underneath or otherwise give you more information for forming you strategy., Your aim is to match every card in the deck, and matches between the stock and waste are less likely to occur than matches to the tableau. You will have multiple chances to cycle through your stock to match with the tableau cards.

, For basic pyramid solitaire, the game is over when:


You have matched and removed every card in the tableau, stock, and waste. This means you have won the game.
You have gone through the deck (moved all of the cards from the stock to the waste) three times. This means you have lost the game."
"
Play with a set of reserve cards.,
Make tableaus of different shapes and sizes.,
Limit yourself to a single pass through your stock.",How to Play Pyramid Solitaire3," Start the game off with an extra row of six free face-up cards in reserve. These cards may be played at any time throughout the game. Keep in mind that the reserve row isn't replenished; you only get six reserve cards per game.


Try using a reserve row if you're having trouble winning the basic game., As you build your pyramid, try spacing out the cards differently to create new and unique patterns. You don't necessarily need a perfect pyramid to create a playable game.


You could also make a pyramid with essentially the same layout as the basic game but with an extra row, making the base eight cards wide.

, Only allow yourself to go through your stock once. Waste cards can never return to the stock, and the only way to go back through your waste is to match each top card. This adds a challenge to the game if you find yourself getting too good at it.In addition to the extra difficulty, this variation has more unwinnable hands.

"
"
Choose your level of difficulty.,
Take advantage of the ""Hint"" feature.,
Don't be afraid of the ""Undo"" button.,
Know the scoring.",How to Play Spider Solitaire4," If you're a newbie to the Spider Solitaire scene, you'll want to start off with one suit. It's not shameful -- two-suit and four-suit are hard. Once you get accustomed to one-suit, you can move onto the harder versions.


A large part of this game is luck. If you get thrown bad sequences from the stock, you could be outta luck. Play a handful of games before you write off your skill.

, Pressing ""H"" tells Windows you could go for a little assistance. It'll then light up the next card you should move. Don't hit it freely though -- try to take a look as to why that was the best next move.


Try to limit yourself to a few hints each game. Relying on it too much prevents you from having to figure out patterns and strategy.

, Especially if you're doing four-suit solitaire, the undo button will be your best friend. Consider it ""peeking."" If you're not sure whether you should move a card or not, move it, see what's under it, and if it's not worth it, put it back!


Same goes for this button as the hint button. You don't want to depend on it, but it's good to have if you really, really need it!

, In the Windows version, you start out with 500 points. With every move you make, it subtracts a point. Then, if you win, it multiplies that score by 100. See if you can beat your own personal record next time!

Make Your Own Scrolls.",How to Play a Wizard in Dungeons and Dragons V3.51," Before you start your first session of D&D during which you will create your character you should read the entire entry about wizards in the Player's Handbook (PHB).;
, Every race can be a wizard, but Half-Orcs are poorly suited to the class. Elf wizard is the stereotype but you should feel free to break away from this, there is no logical reason why Elves make better wizards than any other race. Many people prefer Humans for a wizard. If you want to focus on illusions then you should consider playing a Gnome. Anything with a penalty to Intelligence is a questionable choice for a wizard.

, Consult with your Dungeon Master (DM) and find out what system(s) can be used to generate your vital statistics (stats). If it is allowed you should always use the ""point buy"" system to make a wizard. Intelligence is the only stat that really matters for a wizard and you will want to start with an 18 if that is at all possible. After Intelligence Constitution and Dexterity are also important because they will boost your Armor class and Hit points. Many wizards have very low Strength, Wisdom, and Charisma because these stats are not important to them.

, Wizards end up with many skill points by virtue of their superior Intelligence. Good skills for every wizard include Concentration, Knowledge Arcana, and Spellcraft. These skills relate closely to magic (Concentration allows you to cast spells even when distracted). Wizards also can take ranks in any of the Knowledge skills. These skills can be very helpful to new players because many of them provide information about the enemies that you will face. For example, you are attacked by a monster so you roll a skill check with an appropriate knowledge skill. If you succeed the DM will tell you the monster's name, its strengths, and its weaknesses. This information can be the difference between victory and defeat. With feats you want to focus on feats that enhance your ability to cast spells. Do not waste your time trying to become better at physical combat or make yourself less fragile. You cannot achieve this in that fashion. Instead use your feats to enhance your magic and then use your magic to enhance yourself, this will work better every time. When you select a metamagic feat, make sure that you can use it effectively. For example, the feat Extend Spell makes spells last twice as long and as a cost it raises the level of the spell by one. So an Extended Mage Armor is a level two spell, not level one, and lasts for two hours per level, not one hour per level. However, if you cannot yet cast level two spells this feat is not yet useful to you. Item creation feats are nice, but do not forget that it takes time and Experience Points (XP) to create any item.

, Choosing a specialty school of magic gives you more spells every day and makes some of your spells more powerful. However it also means you must choose two schools that are prohibited, meaning that you cannot cast spells from those schools. For beginners it is recommended that you do not specialize. This is best left for later when you know which spells you like to use.

,, A wizard can know more spells than any other class in D&D but they must learn each one before it can be cast. When you start at first level you will know all of the level 0 spells (cantrips) and two level one spells, plus one additional level one spell per point of Intelligence modifier. So a wizard with an Intelligence of 18 would know six level one spells at first level. Remember that each spell takes one page of your spellbook per level of the spell, with level zero spells taking one half a page each. You must keep track of what spells are in your spellbook and how many pages you have left. When you run out you must buy a new spellbook. You will gain two additional spells at each level. The spells you gain in this manner are free to scribe into your spell book, additional spells cost 100 Gold Pieces (gp) per level of the spell. It is always worth learning a new spell.

, This is mostly a style choice. Your familiar is not very strong and if it dies you suffer a steep penalty. Choose one that suits your character's personality and do not forget to consider the bonus that each one confers.

, A wizard does not need much at first. You cannot wear armor, carry a shield, or use most weapons. A quarterstaff and a dagger are good weapons to carry because they are cheap and have more uses than combat. How can you cut ropes binding your friends without a knife, or test the depth of a river without a stick? If you plan to use your Scribe Scroll feat, which you should, then you should carry some parchment. A scroll case is also a good investment for a wizard.

, A wizard does a variety of jobs. He can use magic to enhance the party, he can attack the enemy, he can manipulate people, and so on. What your role is in each campaign may depend on how other party members play. Try to be flexible. In combat, remember that sometimes that best spell is not the one that could cause a lot of damage. If you immobilize an opponent you may turn a deadly fight into an easy one.

, You should know how every spell in your spellbook works. This will speed up the game and make your wizard more effective. It will also help you prepare an effective choice of spells for your daily preparation.

, The best wizard is the one who can cast a huge variety of spells. Do not neglect to learn new spells just because it costs money. A fighter spends his money on weapons and armor, so does a wizard but spells are his weapons and armor. If you find a scroll of a spell you do not know, consider copying it into your spellbook (which expends the scroll) instead of casting it.

, This ability of wizards is often poorly utilized. Spells whose effects are not dependent on your level are the best candidates for scrolls. There are also spells that are rarely used, but when needed are vital. These are also good choices for scrolls, you do not want to waste a daily spell slot on a spell you rarely cast, but you also do not want to risk not having it when you need it. If that is the case, make a scroll.

Get together in a group and play!",How to Play Dungeons and Dragons for Free2," Play the demo on the Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) website. This will familiarize you with the game and give you a basic idea of the flow and systems at work.

, Dice are the only material that is required from all players. There is a dice roller at WOTC's site, or you can find a printable paper template and make your own. A pencil with dots on each side makes an inexpensive replacement for six-sided dice.

, If you want the traditional DnD-style game, go with dwarves, elves, humans and even half-lings. If you want sci-fi, you can use any sort of aliens you want.

Purchase the handbooks.,
Understand race.,
Understand class.,
Understand alignment.,
Understand the role of the dice.",How to Play Dungeons and Dragons2," To be able to play Dungeons and Dragons, also known as D&D or more commonly DnD, you need to know the rules. If you can't find a store to buy the books from, try some website such as amazon.com. Read through the handbooks to the point that you understand the basic rules.


There are several editions of the game, with different rules and procedures. Third and fourth edition are most common, currently. The fourth edition is considered to be the most user friendly and easiest to pick up.

, There are different races which your character can be. These vary slightly between editions, but the most common include human, dwarf, elf, halfling, half-elf, half-orc, and gnome. The different races will have different inherent abilities, benefits and downsides. This will affect how your character gets by in life.

, Class is what your character does, what they’re good at or have chosen to do with their life. Importantly, it determines the skills they will have which affects the role your character will have in the group. It is important to choose a class befitting your race. The classes are, again, different depending on edition. Common classes include fighter, rogue, and wizard.

, Your character will also have a moral alignment which you will need to consider. This will help you determine how your character would react in certain situations, as well as the decisions they would make.

, There are a number of dice used when playing DnD. These are not just normal dice, but rather special dice with an unusual number of sides. The most common DnD dice is the classic d20 (quickly followed by a d10) but you will need a number of others. The best option is to get a full set from your local game shop.


The dice will be used almost every time the player or Dungeon Master (DM) takes an action. The difficulty or chance of something occurring is attached to a particular type of dice. You roll, and if the number is high enough then the action can occur, going well, terribly, or any number of other outcomes as determined by the DM.

"
"
Join a game.,
Organize your own game.,
Designate a Dungeon Master (DM).,
Find a place to play.",How to Play Dungeons and Dragons3," The simplest, best, and easiest way to get started is to join an existing group. If you are less socially apt than average, this can seem daunting but ultimately can be a great way for you to make new friends. You can search local forums, ask around at cons, or inquire or advertise at your local game shop. Many universities and colleges, as well as some high schools, will also have clubs.


You must email, phone and/or meet the person hosting the group, and ask to join the game. The main thing you want to establish is age or social group. D&D is an activity that a mixed-age group can enjoy, but you don't necessarily want to be the only teenager in a room full of 40-year-olds.

, This takes a little more work on your part. You can advertise in many of the same locations described above or recruit friends, family, or coworkers to play with you.

, If you are the one organizing the game, this will likely be you. The DM should have a strong knowledge of the rules, or at least be willing to learn and run the game. They will want to do a little bit of preparation of an adventure before the first session.


This person should purchase or already have copies of the core rulebooks: The Player's Handbook, The Dungeon Master's Guide & the Monster Manual I. There are tons more books available, but you only need these three to run the game.

, Typically this involves a table with some chairs around it, and is usually at the DM's house/apartment (not for any real good reason, that just seems to be how it pans out). This should preferably be somewhere without distractions such as the TV or other folks who won't be playing, though some local pubs or game stores will sometimes specialize in providing facilities to groups for a fee or free.

"
"
Show up.,
Create characters.,
Begin your adventure.,
End of Game - Most sessions will end at or near a predetermined time.",How to Play Dungeons and Dragons4," You will, of course, have to actually show up come game night. DnD is a commitment, since it is difficult to enjoy the game if members of the group are constantly missing. When joining a game, you should be willing and prepared to work with their schedule.

, For the first session, you will need to create your characters. This can be done alone, before meeting as a group, or together. Creating characters together should lead to a more balanced party, as you can discuss what is needed. Doing this together is also helpful for new or inexperienced players.


Make sure everyone has a blank character sheet or use a program like Redblade to do it for you.
Read the instructions regarding character creation in the Player's Handbook and have everyone but the DM create a character.
Take note of the differences between races and classes, and which complement each other. For example, if you decide to be a Fighter and this is your first time out, a Human or Half-Orc will be a far better choice than either an Elf or a Gnome. On the other hand, if you want a challenge, then try a Monk or a Spell Caster of any sort (Sorcerer, Druid, Cleric, Wizard, etc.)
The character you create will be called your Player Character (PC). All the other characters that are in the game world which are not controlled by a Player are called Non-Player Characters (NPC) and will be controlled by the Dungeon Master.

, You can move right into this step on the first session after you finish making characters, or this could also be the second session. Either way, this is where you all begin actually playing the game.


Each player controls their own PCs. You cannot control other people's PC, nor can you control NPCs.
The DM will describe where you are and what is around you.
The players all take turns telling the DM what action they would like to do in response. The DM will answer each question and explain what the outcome of any action.
Play will continue in this way, back and forth between the players and DM.

, The average time is determined by how often you play - if you can play once a week, then those sessions may be only four hours, whereas if you can only play once a month everyone may opt for eight hour sessions. Whichever you prefer, the DM generally keeps track of the time and will call the end of game when appropriate.


Most DMs prefer to create an episodic ""cliff-hanger"" feel right before some kind of action to stop at. This essentially pauses the adventure at an intriguing point so that excitement for how it will resolve at the next session is high among the players. Just like a TV show, this will encourage everyone to come back next time!

"
"
Start the game.,
Look for other examples.",How to Play Dungeons and Dragons5," Start the game with the DM telling you where you are and some general ideas about your surroundings, Such as: ""You find yourself in a swamp. To the North you can see a house. To the West you can go further into the swamp. The East and South passages are blocked by dense growth"".


Player 1: ""I move to the North slowly, drawing my sword in case something attacks us.""
Player 2: ""How deep is the swamp water?""
Player 3: ""Is the house in good repair?""
Player 4: ""I move to the North, too.""
DM: ""The two of you begin to move north slowly, the mud sucking at your boots from below the waterline. The water is about one to two feet deep; generally shin-deep. {Player 3}, you try to determine the quality of the house from where you are. Make a perception check.""
Player 3, who is trying to see if she can do something that may or may not be feasible, is asked to make a ""perception check"". She will roll a twenty-sided die (d20) and add her skill of perception to the total. The DM, in secret, will determine a number that represents how difficult it would be to succeed; this is called the ""DC"". If the player's total is equal or above the DC, then the attempt succeeds. More detail on how this works can be found in the Player's Handbook or in the SRD (System Reference Document).
Player 3 rolls a 13 on the d20. She adds the +3 she has in Spot, giving her PC a total of 16 to see the condition of the house. The DM had made the DC a 10, as it was fairly easy to see.
DM: ""Squinting at the structure, you see that it seems to be leaning a bit to the side, with boards on the windows. It is unlikely that anyone has lived there in some time, but as to anything living there... well, you're not too sure.""

Understand the dartboard.,
Find a friend (or friends) to play with.,
Set up the scoreboard.,
Familiarize yourself with the rules of the game:


The winner is the first player to 'close out' all of the required numbers (15–20, plus the bullseye) while scoring equal or more points than their opponent.,
Begin playing.,
Keep score.,
Put a line through a number once both players have closed it out, indicating that it is no longer eligible for points.,
If the first person/team to close everything out also has equal or more points than their opponent, the game is over.",How to Play Cricket Darts," The circular board is composed of 'pie slices' with one 'slice' for each number 1 through 20. There is an outer double ring that runs around the edge of the entire dartboard as well as an inner triple ring, which is located between the double ring and the center bullseye. The bullseye itself has two parts: the outer bullseye and the inner bullseye.
Check out How to Throw Darts if this is your first time throwing a dart.;
, If you are playing with more than one person on each team, decide the order that your players will throw in. If possible, create the teams evenly with the same number of players and relatively similar skill levels.

, Dartboards in public places generally have a chalkboard or whiteboard near the dartboard. If not, grab a pen and paper. Write the names the people/teams at the top of your scoreboard. In a vertical column down the middle of the scoreboard, write out the numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and bullseye (or B for short).

,
A number is considered 'closed out' once it has been hit three times during the game. If the dart lands in the outer double ring of a number, it counts as two hits; the inner triple ring counts as three. For the bullseye, the outer bullseye is worth one hit and the inner bullseye is worth two. Sadly there is no triple bullseye.
If a player closes out a number before their opponent, they gain points every time they hit that same number until their opponent also closes it out. Once both players close out a number, neither can gain any more points from it.
Points are equal to the value of the closed out number, including any doubling or tripling. For example, if you close out the 20 and then hit a triple 20, you get 60 points. The outer bullseye is worth 25 points, and the inner bullseye is worth 50 points.

, Each player throws three darts per turn. A common strategy is to start the game by aiming at the 20—specifically the triple 20—since it is worth the most points, while saving the bullseye for last since it is hardest to hit. However, there is no required sequence, especially for beginners.

, The first time you hit a number, put a diagonal mark next to the number on the scoreboard. When you hit the same number again, create an X by adding an intersecting diagonal mark in the opposite direction. The third time you hit a number it is considered 'closed out,' which you indicate by putting a circle around the X like this: Ⓧ.

, Remember, if you close out a number before the other player, you can continue to hit that number and rack up points until the other player closes it out.

, If they have fewer points than their opponent, the game continues. In the picture above, Team Dog won because they closed out all of the numbers and had the most points.

The moderator should next tell everyone playing to ""wake up"".

Once someone has been nominated, someone else has to agree and second him. Once the person has been seconded that person is now ""on trial"".

The first person to nominate the person ""on trial"" has to give their reason for nominating him or her. Then the person who seconded the person ""on trial"" has to give their reason.
The person that is on trial has the opportunity to give their defense. The defense can be as long as the person wants it to be, and another person may come to another person’s defense.
Next it is time to vote to see if the person is killed or not. If the majority wants the person to live, than that person will stay alive, and if the majority wants that person to be voted off, then they are dead for the round.

After a person dies, the moderator can tell everyone what the person was in the game.




This process will continue until someone is voted off.

Read About Sorcerers.,
Pick a Race.,
Generate and Assign Your Vital Statistics.,
Pick Your Starting Skills and Feats.,
Pick Your ""Spells Known"".,
Pick Your Sorcerer's Alignment.

,
Choose a Familiar.,
Buy Starting Equipment.,
Know Your Role in the Party.,
Know Your Spells.",How to Play a Sorcerer in Dungeons and Dragons V3.5," Before the character creation session, or at least before the first session where you play, you should read the entire entry on sorcerers in the Player's Handbook (PHB).;
, Almost all races make good sorcerers. The exceptions are Dwarves and Half-Orcs, their penalty to Charisma makes them bad candidates for the sorcerer class. Every other race in the PHB is suitable with their own advantages and disadvantages.

, Consult with the Dungeon Master (DM) and find out how you should generate your vital statistics (stats). There are many different systems and most DMs will have strict rules concerning this part of character creation. If you can, you should use the ""point buy"" system to create your sorcerer's stats. This way you can assure yourself an 18 Charisma. If you cannot use point buy then you should place your highest score to Charisma. You will also benefit from a high Constitution and Dexterity. The other stats are less important to you. A high Intelligence is nice, but not vital to a good sorcerer.

, Sorcerers rarely get many skill points so choosing skills goes quickly. Concentration, Knowledge Arcana, and Spellcraft are all good choices because they relate to spellcasting. Concentration allows you to cast spells even when distracted. Other skill choices will likely be made according to the personality that you have in mind for your new character. With your high Charisma a few social skills may be a wise investment. When you choose your feats you should focus on feats that enhance your spellcasting. You may be tempted to try to ameliorate your weaknesses but this rarely works very well, instead try to enhance your strong point, spellcasting. Good spells will help you later when it comes to your weaknesses. When you select a metamagic feat, make sure that you can use it effectively. For example, the feat Extend Spell makes spells last twice as long and as a cost it raises the level of the spell by one. So an Extended Mage Armor is a level two spell, not level one, and lasts for two hours per level, not one hour per level. However, if you cannot yet cast level two spells this feat is not yet useful to you. Item creation feats are nice, but do not forget that it takes time and Experience Points (XP) to create any item. At higher levels the feat Rapid Metamagic is helpful for all sorcerers.

, A sorcerer knows very few spells, but can cast them many times per day. This means that choosing your spells known is very important. One good strategy is to try to have one spell that hurts the enemy and one that helps allies at each level. Knowing the personality that you plan to give your new sorcerer will help you pick appropriate spells. Veteran players may be able to help you choose the most effective spells.

,, This is mostly a style choice. Your familiar is not very strong and if it dies you suffer a steep penalty. Choose one that suits your character's personality and do not forget to consider the bonus that each one confers.

, Sorcerers need very few material possessions in the first level, eventually you will be draped with powerful magic items but at first there is very little that can help you. You cannot wear armor, carry a shield, or wield most weapons. You can wield simple weapons though such as a crossbow, dagger, or quarterstaff. Even though you will not fight in melee combat a melee weapon like a quarterstaff or dagger has other uses, so consider getting one. A ranged weapon, a light crossbow is the most common choice, is helpful at lower levels when you are more likely to run out of magic during a fight.

, Your role in the party is determined by the spells that you choose. If you choose all attack magic then your role is to stand back and blast the enemy into cinders. If you choose spells beneficial to others (buff spells) then your job is to enhance other members of the party. If there is a wizard in the party as well you can make the party stronger by coordinating your spell choices.

, You should know how every spell your sorcerer can cast works. If you do not then it will slow down the game and weaken your character. If you choose a spell, then read the description of it carefully at least twice.

Decide which game you want to play.,
Find a group of like-minded players.,
Decide who your referee or ""gamemaster"" will be.,
Make your characters.,
Play, and have fun.,
The Gamemaster will also adjudicate the rules and make calls as to who can do what and describe the effects of a particular action the characters take.",How to Play a Roleplaying Game," Some games are more complex than others. Some games are set in fantasy worlds, some are more realistic. Some are even futuristic. If there has been a book or a movie written about it, fiction or non-, you can probably roleplay it.;
, Roleplaying is generally a social activity, so once you've decided what you want to focus on, it's time to find two or three other people interested in the same thing.

, It will most likely be whoever knows the rules of the game best.

, Just what a ""character"" means will depend on which game you end up playing, but in most games, there will be a myriad of character types you can choose from. Your ""Character"" will be your means of interacting with the game, with you (as a player) making all the decisions as to the character's actions. You decide what actions your character will take and which they won't. This is often one of the most rewarding experiences of the game, seeing the consequences and rewards of certain choices and their effects on the character and his/her friends and environment.

, Having fun, after all, is the main point. If your character doesn't last, you can always make a new one. The Gamemaster will describe the settings and will play the parts of the people your characters will meet and interact with. The players will state how they interact with the environment and how they react to situations the Game master presents.

, So every monster you face, every merchant you buy things from, every rebel commander, will be acted out by the Gamemaster. If it sounds like a tough job, it is! But being the Gamemaster can be very rewarding.

Decide on what your game will be about: fantasy, sci-fi, real life or anything you can imagine.,
Create a world you will play in.,
Now you have your worlds it's time to create a character.,
Now that you have a world and a character, it's time to start playing.,
So we now know what we are doing on our quest and where we are going but, we don't know how.,
Once you have defeated a monster you need to find the scroll.,
Now you have done your first quest you will need to know how your character page changes.,
So you now know how to create a world and a character, you how to quest and battle and you know how the character sheet works.",How to Play a Role Playing Game by Yourself,";
, Draw a map of your house on paper . Then label every room to be a certain place e.g. Marsh, Town, dark forest, lake, mountains. You can use the same world that you would find in adventure quest worlds. You can do the same with RuneScape or wow if you want, just pick any other game that has an interesting world in it. If your house isn't big enough for all of the world, you can make rooms to be two different places that change when you want them to.

, You will need another sheet of paper for this. Think of a name and write it at the top of the sheet of paper. Then draw out a big portrait rectangular box on the left hand side of he sheet of paper this will be where you draw your character, or if you don't like drawing it will be where you write what you have on you eg sword, armor etc. There are four classes to choose from. Mage, warrior, healer, and rouge. Each have there own special abilities that you come up with later. Eg a wizard has spells, a warrior has special heavy blows etc. You then must draw out a bar on the right side of the paper, make sure you do all of this in pencil. The bar will be how much exp you have. You gain more from battling monster and doing quests. When your bar becomes full you level up learning a new move. We will come on to how to fill in this later. Also do a bar for your health and a bar for your mana under the exp bar. Draw another box for your items and then your character sheet will be finished.

, In your world you will fight monsters and do quests to see what level you can get to. You will decide on what your character does in this world. In the town you start in, there will be an imaginary person to set you on your quest. The best kind of quest involves fighting creatures, getting around obstacles you have set up and a bit of finding objects. It doesn't have to conform to any specific rule (other than the rules of your role playing game and/or the world in which you are playing) but start simple and think up your own quests. The first step is to go to the place where the task is to be done and decide on the monster you will fight. See the next step in learning how to fight.

, First of all you will need some dice, e.g. use the 12 sided dice on your iPod touch role playing game dice application, but 6 sided dice will do fine, you will just have to use double the amount of dice. The weapon you start with depends on your class, a healer or a Mage will have a basic staff, a warrior will have a basic sword, and a rogue will have a basic dagger, all of these weapons do 5 dice damage (if you are using 6 sided dice this will be 10 dice damage). The monster you are fighting will have 200-300 health and you will have 500 health to start with but this can go up when you level up. You roll first, roll the dice and see how much damage you inflict. You minus that off his health. He now has 50 health left etc. He then fights you he has 3 dice damage. (again double this if you are using 6 sided dice.) Minus his damage off your health bar. When ever yours or the monsters health bar goes to zero you or the monster dies. If you die you can ever go back to your hometown now, or you can wait 10 minutes and retire to the same place. Now we know to battle we can continue with our quest.

, What you do for this is search your house for a certain item eg something purple, something with buttons, something round, something that has a picture of a face on it, etc. Because we need to find five ancient scrolls, we need to defeat 5 monsters and find find 5 items in the same category. However, you can't just stay in the same place in the room all the time you must explore after every 3 kills. You do this by setting a challenge, something like jumping from one sofa to the other, or climbing along your garden fence.Once you are at the next part you can kill the remaining monsters you need to kill. Once you have done this you have completed the quest.

, First of all let's but a new weapon, you can start with 10,000 gold which can buys you a... Spider sword, Warlocks fire/ice staff, a dragon tooth dagger or a big bad blade of destruction. Choose one to buy, these weapons are better than your old one so add one dice to how many you roll in battle. Draw this new sword on your character on the drawing. Swords that cost more do more damage, so save up your gold if you want to kill hard monsters. Now to know how to fill in your exp bar as you battle creatures you get experience, you get 50 exp every time you kill a creature and you get 300 exp every time you kill a boss (a very hard creature.) for level one you have to get 500 exp to level up, so shade in 50'exp into the bar when the whole bar is shades you level up and learn a new move 1/5. You decide what this move is and what it does, whether it let's you attack twice in a row or whether it can heal 30 of your health. You must wait 3 turns before you use the same move again and you must lower your mana bar by a certain amount when you use the move.

, This is pretty much all you need to know to have fun playing your rpg. Go on quests, battle monsters... But most of all have fun and pass the time away.

Read About Rogues.,

Generate and Assign Your Vital Statistics (stats).,
Pick Your Starting Skills and Feats.,
Pick Your Rogue's Alignment.

,
Buy Starting Equipment.,
Know Your Role in the Party.",How to Play a Rogue in Dungeons and Dragons V3.5," You should read the entire entry about rogues in the Player's Handbook before the first session of D&D when you plan to play your new rogue.;
, You need to pick a race for your character. Unlike the other classes, virtually any race can be made into a rogue. However, different races make different types of rogues. A Half-Orc rogue will be a thug, for example, because his below average Charisma and Intelligence make him ill-suited for social interaction and finesse. Elves and Halflings make good archery based rogues, especially Halflings. Humans make a great choice for any style of rogue.

, There are several ways to generate stats so you should consult with the Dungeon Master (DM) first to learn what system is being used. Once you have the numbers you will use you can assign them to stats. Dexterity is usually the most important stat for a rogue. If you plan to fight in close combat then Strength and Constitution are also very important. Intelligence is important because it determines you skill points and rogues make frequent use of their skills. If you plan to use social interaction skills then a good Charisma is important.

, This is where you really decide what kind of rogue you will be. Spy, thief, assassin, thug, and con man are all archetypes that you could base your rogue on. Pick feats and skills that fit into that idea. Hide and Move Silently let you be stealthy, Tumble lets you move about the battlefield more easily, Bluff and Diplomacy let you talk your way out of trouble. You will soon find that even with all the skill points that rogues get it is not enough to master everything. Some people master a few skills, others like to be a jack of all trades. Feats like Point Blank Shot are important for archers, Weapon Finesse may help a close combat specialist. Read and decide.

,, You will need a weapon and some light armor. You should also take a look at the mundane items list as well as the tools. Rogues need a tool kit to use certain skills, such as Open Lock.

, As the rogue you will always be a support character in combat. While your sneak attack can deal impressive damage given the chance your Armor Class (AC) is low as are your Hit Points (HP). Against enemies that are immune to sneak attack you may find yourself unable to deal any damage. Always have a back up plan, such as magic items you can activate with Use Magic Device. If you fight in close combat then you need to make friends with the fighter, you will need his help to flank enemies so that you can utilize your sneak attack ability. Outside of combat you may be a scout or the voice of the party, possibly both. You may also find yourself sweeping dungeons of dangerous traps because as a rogue you are the only character able to do this.

Know Your Role in the Party.",How to Play a Bard in Dungeons and Dragons," Before you make the character or play one you should read the entire entry about Bards in the Player's Handbook (PHB). The Bard often acts as the party's face in NPC interactions, and is usually a supporter in combat.;
, Bards rely on their Charisma and Intelligence to survive. As such, races with penalties to these stats are bad choices. We strongly recommend against playing Dwarves or Half-Orcs. Especially Half-Orcs.

, Bards can't be Lawful. When you're travelling the world performing and wooing women, rules are more like guidelines.

, You should first ask the Dungeon Master (DM) of your game how vital statistics (stats) can be made. While Bards can get by on Charisma and Intelligence alone, other stats allow him much more versatility, especially with skills. Strength is useful for melee fighters, but a melee Bard with the Weapon Finesse feat is better off with high Dexterity, which also helps with many rogue-like skills and increasing your Armor Class. Constitution is useful for the HP it provides, but a Bard should not be in a situation to need high HP. Wisdom is useful for Spot and Listen checks, but Intelligence nets you more skill points, and Charisma gives you your spells, as well as powering your performances, so these two stats should be your highest, with Dexterity coming in third.

, This is a fun one. Much like a Rogue, Bards get a lot of freedom from their skills. Obviously, a Bard should have a high Perform skill in something, as it powers his music. Concentration is good to have as well, to help keep performing through distractions. Most other skills are optional, but since you will probably wind up doing the most interacting with NPCs, Diplomacy can be a very useful skill to have. Knowledge (History) will increase your Bardic Knowledge rolls, which can be very useful. For feats, things that improve your music and magic are good, as are things that help reduce your weaknesses in combat. For a Bard with low Strength and high Dex, for example, Weapon Finesse will make him more useful in melee combat, at least letting him hit things in a pinch.

, All Bards can cast spells from the Bard spell list. You can cast spells on the fly, but they have to be spells you know, which you must choose. You get at least one new spell every level, but choose wisely.

, You will need a primary weapon and a back up weapon. Even if you are planning on hanging around the edges of the fray and using your Bardic Music all through combat, you should still have some weapons just in case. What you choose is up to you. Remember, a Bard is not meant to leap valiantly into the fray and hack at things -- that's the fighter's job. A Bard can support pretty well, though, and hold a flanking position for the rogue or attack from afar with a shortbow or crossbow. You will want light armor, since it doesn't impede your spell chance; studded leather is good at first level. You also might want to grab some survival gear (bedroll, rations, etc.).

, As you level up you will get certain class abilities. Make sure that you read about each one as you gain it and that you understand it. If you do not use all your powers correctly you will either annoy the other players or weaken your character, possibly both.

, You should review your spells in the PHB when you get them so that you know how to use them. It slows down the game a lot if you try to use a spell you do not understand. Your repertoire is limited, but if you're creative, you can do some useful things.

, Your choices during character creation shape your role in the party. If you have stealth skills than you can make a great forward scout. Social skills might let you be the spokesperson of the party. During direct combat you are a supporting fighter. You can help the fighter by flanking in melee combat or possibly by picking off enemy archers with well placed arrows, but what you really want to be doing is using your bardic music and magic at the start of combat or at crucial junctures to inspire the party to great heights, or to trick opponents into attacking a tiger that isn't there.

Know Your Role in the Party.",How to Play a Ranger in Dungeons and Dragons V3.5," Before you make the character or play one you should read the entire entry about rangers in the Player's Handbook (PHB).;
, Every race can become a good ranger although this choice may affect what kind of ranger you are. One key is that rangers must decide if they will be archery or melee combat specialists. If you want to use melee combat then Dwarf, Half-Orc, or Human are good choices. If you want to be an archer then Elf, Halfling, or Human are good choices. One rarely played kind of ranger is based on more social skills, much like a detective; Half-Elves and Humans are good at this type.

, You should first ask the Dungeon Master (DM) of your game how vital statistics (stats) can be made. Rangers need good stats because of their diverse abilities. If you wish to fight in melee you will want a 16 or better Strength, 14 or better Constitution and Dexterity, and 12 or better Wisdom and Intelligence. If you want to be an archer then you will want a 16 or better Dexterity (really 18 or higher is best but 16 will work),a 12 or better Constitution, Intelligence and Wisdom, and a 10 or better Strength. If you want to be a more social character, such as a detective who tracks criminals, then you will want slightly more emphasis on mental stats and less on physical ones. These are the ideal and are hard to obtain with the point buy system of stat generation. You may need a lucky roll to be a good ranger.

, Choosing skills is a little difficult for a ranger because there are many good choices and they do not have enough points to learn all the useful skills. If you wish to stalk your prey like a predator then you will need Hide, Move Silently, Spot and Listen. If you wish to make use of the ranger's tracking feat (obtained for free and first level) then you will need the Survival skill. If you wish to get information from other humanoids then you will need Bluff, Gather Information, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive. If you plan to take an animal companion at fourth level then you will need the Handle Animal skill to control it. Your feats primarily affect your combat ability. Feats such as Weapon Focus, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, and Cleave all help melee fighters. Instead of Power Attack and Cleave archers will want feats like Precise Shot and Rapid Shot. Make sure that you do not take a feat that you gain from you ranger class levels.

, All rangers specialize in pursuing a small number of types of creature. At levels 1, 5, 10, 15, & 20 you get to add a new favored enemy. For a full explanation of the ability read its description in the ranger section of the PHB. When choosing your favored enemy you may make the choice based on your character's personality. For example a childhood trauma involving an animated corpse may lead them to hunt down and destroy the undead. Alternatively you may base the choice on the game's world. You can ask the DM if there are any creatures that are particularly troublesome in your character's home region, or perhaps some that are hunted for monetary gain.

, You will need a primary weapon and a back up weapon. For archers your back up weapon is a melee weapon and for melee combat specialists it is a ranged weapon. The long bow is the best ranged weapon for an archer, eventually you will get a composite long bow. For melee fighters the choice is a little more difficult. You will be fighting with two weapons so you should review the rules for two weapon fighting in the PHB. If your weapons are not the right type it will give you penalties. A one-handed martial weapon and a light martial weapon are a common choice; for example a long sword and a short sword or a battle axe and a hand axe. All rangers need armor, studded leather is good at first level, and survival gear (bedroll, rations, etc.).

, As you level up you will get certain class abilities. Make sure that you read about each one as you gain it and that you understand it. If you do not use all your powers correctly you will either annoy the other players or weaken your character, possibly both.

, At later levels a Ranger gets some minor spell casting. Your spells are similar to a druid's and mostly deal with surviving in nature and dealing with plants and animals. You should review your spells in the PHB when you get them so that you know how to use them. It slows down the game a lot if you try to use a spell your do not understand. Remember that you have to select your character's spells for the day after each time they sleep.

, You choose an animal companion as if you were a druid of three levels less than you are, for example a 6th level ranger and a 3rd level druid get the same type of animal companion. If you choose to have an animal companion you should prepare a small character sheet for it including its armor class (AC), attacks, saving throws, and so on so that you can use it easily during the game. Information about animal companions is found in the PHB's entry about druids. You do not have to take an animal companion.

, Your choices during character creation shape your role in the party. If you have stealth skills than you can make a great forward scout. Social skills might let you be the spokesperson of the party. During direct combat you are a supporting fighter. You can help the fighter by flanking in melee combat or possibly by picking off enemy archers with well placed arrows.

Arrange your vital statistics and pick your race appropriately.,
Pick your weapons and armor carefully.,
If you have a one-handed weapon consider a shield.,
Choose your feats carefully.,
Pick Your Fighter's Alignment.

,
Your role in the party as the fighter is to take and give hits.,
Make friends with any spellcasters in the party.,
If you and a rogue fight in melee, work together whenever possible.",How to Play a Fighter in D&D," If you plan to fight in melee combat then you will need a very high strength and constitution. If you plan to fight with ranged combat then you need a very high dexterity. However, all fighters benefit from higher physical ability scores. Among the mental ability scores intelligence is the most important to fighters. It gives them more skill points and also opens the door to the feats that require Combat Expertise. Humans, Dwarves, and Half-Orcs all make good fighters. Elves make okay archers, but not very good melee fighters. Halflings and Gnomes do not make very good fighters, especially if you are a beginner.;
, Read through the list of weapons and pick one that you like. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages. If you cannot decide, just take a great sword and it will not disappoint you. Also, all characters should carry at least one weapon of both types. So even a melee fighter should carry a bow and an archer should have at least one sword. If there is only one fighter in the party it is better to be a melee fighter than an archer. When you pick armor heavier isn't always better. Heavy armor limits your speed and how much dexterity you can add to your armor class. If your character has a good dexterity (16 or higher) then get light armor. If you have a bad dexterity (12 or lower) get heavy armor. Remember that Dwarves do not take speed penalties for heavy armor.

, If you can carry it a shield will give you a better armor class. Carrying a shield and a weapon in one hand does less damage than a weapon in two hands, but your armor will be better. You have to decide which style you prefer.

, It pays to plan ahead and know what feats you want to take. If you do not, you may find later that there is a really good feat that you cannot take because you do not meet the requirements to take it. Some feats may sound good at first but turn out to not work very well in the game. Ask experienced players what they think if you are not sure. If you do take a feat that doesn't work well ask the DM if you can swap it for another feat when you level up.

,, It sounds brutal, but your job really is to get the monsters to attack you. The rest of the party does not have as good armor and hit points as you, so you need to take the brunt of the enemy attack. You should, of course, be smart about it and know when to retreat. In the meantime, you will be dealing as much damage as possible to the monster.

, You will need the healing and defensive magic of the cleric as well as the buff spells of the wizard. Try to work with them, D&D is a team game.

, When the rogue flanks an enemy with you he deals sneak attack damage as well, greatly increasing the rogue's effectiveness. Again, D&D is a team game.

Know Your Role in the Party.",How to Play a Paladin in Dungeons and Dragons V3.5," Before you create or play a paladin you should read the entry about them in the Player's Handbook (PHB).;
, Most races can become paladins but some are better than others. Humans make the best paladins. Half-Orcs and Dwarves make so-so paladins. Their penalties to Charisma hurt some of the paladin's powers but not by much. Since paladins are melee fighters primarily Halflings and Gnomes make a poor choice, as do Elves. Half-Elves can be paladins as well.

, Consult the Dungeon Master (DM) of your game to see what methods can be used to generate vital statistics (stats) for your paladin. A paladin needs excellent stats, so you may need a lucky roll before you can play one. You will need a high Strength and Constitution, a 16 or better is ideal. You will also need good Wisdom and Charisma scores, a 14 or better. Lastly you will want a Dexterity of 10 or better.

, Most paladins do not get many skill points per level, so choose how you use them carefully. Knowledge Religion is a common choice. Sense Motive is also a good choice as it helps a paladin ferret out evil. Feats that augment your melee combat are good choices. If you plan to engage in mounted combat then Mounted Combat, Ride-by Attack, and Spirited Charge are good choices.

, This step is optional but many paladins choose to select a patron Deity. A paladin may be simply dedicated to righteousness, however if you wish you may select a deity. If you do you need to select one that is neutral or good, a paladin may not worship an evil deity.

,, You will need a main melee weapon and armor. A back up ranged weapon is a good idea. You will also want a holy symbol if you have a patron deity, the wooden one is fine. Lastly you will need survival gear (bedroll, trail rations, etc.).

, You will need to know how to use all of your class abilities such as Detect Evil and Smite Evil. Carefully read about each one as your character gets it and make sure you know how it is used.

, Eventually a paladin gets a small amount of spell casting power. When your paladin get access to this magic you should review all the spells you can cast so that you know how they work when you cast them in the game. Remember that you need to prepare a list of spells that your character can cast each day which can only be changed after your character rests.

, At fifth level you get a paladin's special mount. This animal is based on a standard mount but is superior to it in many ways. You will want to make a short character sheet for your mount so that you can look up numbers for it quickly. Not every paladin needs or wants a mount. It depends on the campaign. You'll know by fifth level, probably.

, Paladins are front-line fighters. Much like the fighter you should protect the rest of the party by engaging the enemy in combat. Do not be afraid to take hits in fights. You can use your magic to bolster yourself and others.

Generate and assign your vital statistics.,
Pick your starting skills and feats.,
Buy starting equipment.,
Know your role in the party.",How to Play a Monk in Dungeons and Dragons V3.5," Before you create and play a monk you should read about them in the Player's Handbook (PHB). You should read about all of the monk's abilities, especially if you plan to play this character for a while.;
, Not every race in the PHB is suited to being a monk. Gnomes and Halflings make terrible monks because of their small size and penalty to strength. Elves may not be a good choice either because of their penalty to Constitution - this will lead to fewer hit points (HP), which means you will not have as much staying power in a fight.


There is no reason to avoid or choose a Half-Elf, their advantages are based on social skills not combat however they have no specific drawbacks that would make them bad monks. Humans and Half-Orcs both make excellent monks.

, Before you begin this part of the process, you need to consult the Dungeon Master (DM) of your game. They will tell you what systems you may use to generate your vital statistics (stats). Monks are very demanding and require excellent stats to play. Many D&D players hold off playing a monk until they get very lucky when rolling for stats.


A monk needs the following stats (listed from most to least important); Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, and Wisdom. If you do not have at least a 14 in each stat you should consider playing a different class and of course, the higher the better.

, Movement based skills are a favorite of monks. This means Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble. Hide and Move Silently are also good choices. Pick skills according to the personality and style you have in mind for your monk. There are many feats that help a monk fight effectively. Weapon Focus, Improved Initiative, and Improve Natural Weapon Size (found in the Monster Manual (MM)) are all good choices.


Keep in mind what feats your monk gets as part of his class and do not take that feat a second time. Some players are fond of the feats Dodge, Mobility, and Spring Attack for a monk. While these feats seem worth it at first level they may be less appealing later so think carefully.

, This is a quick step for monks. You will soon notice that monks have about one tenth as much starting money as other characters. Do not worry though, even naked and empty handed a monk is force to be reckoned with, unlike the other classes.


A quarterstaff, a few shuriken, and survival gear (bedroll, rations, etc.) are enough for most first level monks. At later levels you will acquire a large amount of magic items to help you fight, but for now you have few material possessions.

, You are not capable of dealing as much damage or taking as much damage as a fighter or a barbarian, but you can do many things that they cannot. Monks can serve as partners for the party rogue, especially if you took the Hide and Move Silently skills. Monks make excellent advanced scouts. Perhaps most importantly though, monks are very good at combating enemy mages. Your mobility, spell resistance (SR), and high saving throws (saves) make you good and pushing through a mage's spells and taking them out.

Prepare Your Wild Shape Ability in Advance.",How to Play a Druid in Dungeons and Dragons V3.5," Before you create the character and play it in a session of D&D you should read the entire entry in the Player's Handbook (PHB). This is where you find the basic information about the Druid and its special abilities.;
, All races can play a druid equally well. This means that the choice of a race is almost entirely subjective. One consideration is that if you use the wild shape special ability you will lose any physical characteristics of your race. So races such as Half-Orc and Dwarf that have mostly physical advantages may not be the best choice. Humans make excellent druids.

, Consult your Dungeon Master (DM) to see what system(s) can be used and generate your vital statistics (stats). Wisdom is the key ability for most druid abilities, including spellcasting. However, if you plan to use wild shape and fight in melee combat then you will need a high constitution as well. If you use the wild shape ability your physical stats will change, so if you plan to use wild shape frequently then you should consider favoring your mental stats.

, The skills Concentration, Handle Animal, Knowledge Nature, and Survival are common choices for druids. The skills you choose will determine the type of character you are, so pick according to the personality that you want to have. You will need Handle Animal to command your animal companion. Feats are a more complicated choice for druids. There are essentially two routes a druid can take. The first is spellcasting and the second is wild shape combat. If you plan to go the spellcasting route then you should choose feats that will enhance your spellcasting. If you want to use wild shape and then fight in melee combat then you need to select feats that will help this. You should pick one track and try to specialize, this will get you the best results. Whichever route you take, you will want the feat Natural Spell, which allows you to cast spells while in animal form.

, A druid gets an animal companion that follows them on quests and helps in a variety of ways. There is a list of acceptable animal companions in the PHB. Some DMs will allow substitutions but you must ask before making one. You should prepare a mini character sheet for your animal companion so that you can use it in any situation. Do not forget that at some levels, your animal companion may be made more powerful or swapped for a different animal.

, Note that Druids must be partly neutral to keep most of their powers

, When you buy weapons and armor for a druid you need to pay careful attention to the types of weapon and armor that a druid can use. You may want to get both a melee and a ranged weapon. You will also want basic survival gear; bedroll, rations etc.

, As a druid you are a flexible character. You can be a backup divine caster, as well as deal some damage like an arcane caster. If you choose to maximize your wild shape ability then you can serve as a secondary fighter. Remember that you can choose the best role according to the situation.

, There are many spells that you can cast, you should try to be familiar with them all, or at least the ones that you plan to use frequently. If you do not know your spells well you will slow down the game. Reading the spell entry carefully will also help you determine if a spell is worth preparing or not and make your character more effective.

, Understanding wild shape is the hardest part of playing a druid. You will need to read the rules for the spells Polymorph and Alter Self first, as wild shape is based on those spells. Then you need to read the description of wild shape in the druid entry of the PHB to see how wild shape differs from the two spells it emulates. You may need to read this material two or three times before you understand it fully. Taking notes is a good idea. Once you understand how wild shape works you should look through the Monster Manual (MM) for animals that you would like to turn into. When you find one you like, write down any changes that would occur so that you are ready. If you decide to turn into a wolf in a fight you do not want to make everyone wait while you add up all of the important information. Remember that your modifiers will be similar to, but not the same as, the default entries in the MM.

Pick a dart that's right for you.,
Stand on the oche (pronounced like 'hockey' minus the 'h', aka the toe-line) with the foot corresponding to which hand you intend to throw with perpendicular to the line.,
Draw an imaginary line from where your toe touches the line perpendicular to the oche.,
Stand up straight, shoulders back but comfortable and in line with the center of the board.








,
You can bend forward (toward the board) slightly at the waist, but you should not sacrifice balance or cause discomfort doing so.








,
Grip the dart lightly in your throwing hand.,
When you throw, move only your throwing arm.,
Concentrate on throwing the exact same way at the same point for a few throws.",How to Throw Darts," If you're not a regular player, you may not have a lot of choice in how you pick your darts, as you'll be left to rely upon whatever loaners you can pick up. When choosing your loaners, first make sure that all three darts are of the same weight and design. Buying your own high-quality darts is best, however. See the Tips below for more advice.

Check to make sure the flights are all in one piece and at least similar in shape.










 


Check that the tips are not bent (they don't have to be super sharp to stick in most bristle dartboards) and that the shafts (the part to the rear of the dart that holds the flight in place) are screwed into the barrel (the part you grip when you throw).












;
, Many oches will be ruled, so take note of where you stand so you can stand there again next time.








, Place your rear foot in a location that distributes your weight easily. If you wobble when you throw, you need to spread your feet further apart!








,,, There are many different methods for gripping the dart, so choose one that works best for you and remember it. When selecting your grip, consider that you want the dart stable in your hand and parallel to the floor - or tilted slightly upward - upon release. You also want a clean release, so try to keep as little of your fingers touching the dart as possible. Resist holding the dart like a pencil, as the friction of your fingers can cause the dart to veer off target. Some people spread cue chalk on the fingers of the throwing hand to help with grip.








, Don't hop, bounce, dip, or dive! You want the dart to release at the same point in your throw every time and extra movement will make that nearly impossible! Throw your dart with a smooth, fluid motion. Don't flick or jerk it at the board. You do not need to hurl the dart with great force to make it stick! Always follow through with your hand. This will stop the dart flying left or right. Don't move your head.








, Pick a spot and try to hit it. If you don't, that's okay. What you're looking for here is precision, not accuracy. Your hand and eye will slowly correct for your throw as you play, improving your aim.









Try to have your eye / throwing hand in a line that is central on the dartboard. All you need to worry about is the height of the throw to hit a 60 (in theory).

When you are able to select an epic destiny, it's time to think again.",How to Make the Ultimate Dungeon and Dragons Team," If you are controlling a single character, you should choose a role (preferably not covered by the other players) in the team.


A Leader focuses on healing and ""buffing"" his friends. He also does a bit of fighting and/or controlling. Clerics and artificers are good examples of classes that focus on the Leader role.
A Controller weakens his enemies, making them vulnerable to Defenders. He is also protected by the Defender, since he can't fight properly. Wizards, sorcerers (although less effectively) and sometimes clerics, focus on the controller role.
A Defender protects his friends and devastates his foes with his mighty power. Fighters, paladins, monks and many other classes focus on this role.
A Striker rushes his enemies when they least expect it and release their inner tempest to crush their enemies.Rangers, (archers , two-handed or otherwise)ninjas, rogues and many more focus on striking hard and disappearing from sight.;
, Do you enjoy a well-thought character? Do you enjoy crushing your enemies? What is your personality? What personality did you always wish you had? Your character can be anything, from something like you or what you wish you could be, to a character which is completely different from you in every manner. There is something for everybody.

, Your class reflects your style of play and personality, so choose carefully. You may always choose a reckless and irrational character, but if you were reckless enough to choose to do that, it still reflects your personality, so you still have to choose carefully.

, You can use a standard array, meaning you use the numbers 16, 14, 13, 12, 11 and 10 respectively to any skill you want, or you might want to do a classic 22-point buy, but you must first think of what will help your character most. A wizard might find intelligence to be the most useful ability, while a cleric values wisdom. A fighter would emphasize on strength, while a monk would focus on wisdom. A ranger or rogue would focus on dexterity, while a bard would focus on charisma. You must looks at your class carefully and watch for patterns to find the skills does it (primarily) rely on. Remember to assign your racial bonuses.

, Depending on your class you might be able to pick more or less than four skills to train in at 1st level. To calculate your base skill check bonus, do the following:


Add one half your level.
Add your ability modifier (each skill relies on one of the ability modifiers).
Add 5 if that skill is trained.
If the skill in question relies on Strength, Dexterity or Constitution, subtract your armor check penalty.
Add any racial or feat bonuses.
Add any other bonuses.

, Choosing feats is important. Think of your role in the party when you choose. It's helpful to choose feats that get bonuses from your highest skills and ability scores. Remember that all your decisions revolve around your style of play.

, These can be categorized as utility powers, encounter powers, daily powers and more. As said before, all your decisions should be based on your style of play and your role in the party.

, Fill in all the numbers if you haven't already, calculate your healing surges, HP, Spell Points, etcetera etcetera. The next part is what you actually do during the game to make it powerful, and you may find to your surprise that it is the most important part.

, It may be as obvious as an advertisement, but if you search the whole town and you find nothing you should start talking to people in pubs, where you will almost always find work. If not, you can always go exploring ruins and finding lost artifacts. Make sure that the rest of the party wants that too. It's all about your collective fun!

, Knowing your surroundings is key to surviving. Does that old tree springing up from the tree climbable? Are those elven tree-houses you spotted above the oak trees?

, Climb that tree, negotiate with those elves, help them with all they need, find lost artifacts in the ruins of Xen'drik! Do what you feel you want to do, like it was for real. Live your story, live your hero, and you shall prevail. Your GM will love you for that, and you'll be sure to always be helped by locals if you negotiate appropriately with them.

, It revolves around your play-style. If in your original background you said you were a scholar studying some lost artifact, develop your background! Go find it and study it, and write about it for the whole community of wizards to be able to read your books and learn more, expanding their knowledge!

, Complete your background with anything that happened at your previous level. For example, if you finally found it, write about it! And write a summary of your studies. You could hand it over to the GM to include that in the world. Then everyone that read it will recognize you and will be able to talk to you about it as you both know what is written in the book. Then there is no difference in what the player is imagining in the book and what the players has imagined.

, Now you have to decide whether you want one or not. You might want to think it over, and think about your adventures. Do you really want a prestige class? And if yes, you should probably know why, so you can decide whatever prestige class suits you!

, You might want one or not. If you want one, it could mean an ending earlier then you would have expected when you first started. It would mean it will probably end at level 32. But that is just a way to end the game. You might want to continue adventuring, to become and Elder for your original village, or attain a function of great prestige. You might become a well known individual and start a royal family! Or you might be modest, and keep helping those in need, until you achieve your character's goal in life.

Start acting stupidly.",How to Play a Dumb Character in D&D1," The three basic party roles are expert, spellcaster, and warrior. Experts (such as bards and rogues) are good at sneaking, solving problems, and knowing useful knowledge.

A frisbee
Two empty glass bottles
Beverages of your choosing
Two poles approximately 4.5-5 ft tall, that are thick enough to hold a glass bottle on top. PVC pipes are a great choice for the poles.;
, On a flat field or yard, space the two poles around 50 ft from each other and hammer them into the ground with a mallet. Place a glass bottle on top of each one of the poles.

, Each team requires two players. Both players on the same team stand on either side of the same pole, while the other team stands on either side of the opposite pole. In addition, every player is required to have a beverage in their hand throughout the game.

, Players must stand behind the pole at all times. Teams alternate throwing the frisbee at their opponent’s pole with the goal of knocking off the bottle. The team whose pole is being thrown at can play defense in two ways. Catch the bottle if your opponent manages to knock it off the pole, and catch the frisbee if it misses the pole in a “catchable range”. Generally, “catchable range” lies from a person’s knee to top of the chest, and is judged by the players.

, Only the throwing team can score points:


Zero points are awarded for both a caught frisbee and bottle, catching a missed frisbee in “catchable range”, or when the frisbee is thrown out of “catchable range”.
One point is awarded for a missed frisbee that is dropped by the other team in “catchable range”.
Two points are awarded for a dropped bottle, but the frisbee is still caught.
Three points are awarded for both a dropped bottle and frisbee.

, Play shifts back and forth between teams with a single player per team throwing each round, with the other two players throwing the next round and so forth. This allows play to continue without the need for throwing the frisbee back to other team each round.

, The score to win is typically twenty one points like corn hole. However, the score to win the game can be changed higher or lower based on player preferences.

Know that every dart board is the same.,
Notice that the board is split into distinct sections.,
Know what happens when the dart lands in an ""inner"" red or green section.,
Understand that the center of the board is called the bullseye.,
Know that the rest of the board is split into 20 separate sections, each with a number allocated to that section.",How to Play Darts1," Each board is numbered from 1 - 20 in non-sequential order around the board. You play darts by throwing a small dart onto different parts of the board, counting your points as you go.;
, Each section has points associated with that section. If a dart lands in the outer green or red sections, the thrower scores double that section's number of points.


For example, if you land inside the double ring under 18, you would score 36 points.







, If a dart lands in the inner small green or red sections, the thrower scores triple that section's number of points.


If you land inside the triple ring under 18, for example, you would score 54 points.







, The bullseye is further split into two sections. The inner section (usually red) is called the ""double bull"" or ""cork,"" and the outer section (usually green) is known as the ""single bull"" or just ""bull.""


If a dart lands in the green part of the bullseye, the thrower scores 25 points.






If a dart lands in the red part of the bullseye, the thrower scores 50 points.







, If a dart lands in a (usually) yellow or black section, the thrower scores that number of points.


Let's say you land an 18 in a single point area. You would receive exactly 18 points.

Get ready for a steady stance.,
Keep both feet firmly planted.,
Get the right fingering on a dart.,
Keep the tip of dart up slightly, and try to move it as straight forward and backward as possible.,
Smoothly launch the dart straight forward.",How to Play Darts2," Leaning forwards or backwards is tempting, but offers the thrower less stability than if he/she were to stand upright.


For right-handed players, keep your right foot in front and your left foot in back. Most of your weight should be resting on your right foot, although you don't want to be leaning forward excessively.
For left-handed players, keep your left foot in front and your right foot in back. Most of your weight should be resting on your left foot, although you don't want to be leaning forward excessively.

, You will want to keep your balance throughout the throw. Otherwise, you may pull or push the dart off in an unintended direction.

, Take the dart in your dominant hand's palm and run it through your fingers until you find the center of gravity. Put your thumb a bit behind the center of gravity while placing at least two, and possible four, other fingers on the dart. Do what feels comfortable for you.

, Any extraneous movement here means that the dart will not fly straight.

, Do not throw too hard, it is unnecessary and dangerous.


Darts do not need a great deal of force to stick into the dartboard. Remember, the goal of the game is to score points, not determine who is strongest.

Know that the most common form of the game is simply known as ""01."",
Mark the oche (pronounced /OCK-EE/).,
Throw a dart to see who goes first.,
Have each player take turns throwing three darts each.,
As each player begins to approach 0 points, care must be taken to hit only the areas that are needed.",How to Play Darts3," The object of the game is simple. Each player must reduce his score down to zero.


Why is it called ""01"" then? ""01"" refers to the fact that each player always starts a game with a score that ends in ""01"". Single player games generally start with opponents staked 301 or 501 points. In larger, team games, the starting number of points can be set as high as 1001.

, The oche is the line that a throwing player must stand behind. It is 7ft 9 1/4 inches or 2.37m from the face of the board.

, The person who gets closest to the double bull gets to throw first.

, The points the player scores are then subtracted from his starting total.


For example, if a player is starting with 301 points, and lands 54 points, his/her new total would be 247 points.

, This is because of the manner in which the game is won. In order to win, or ""close-out"" as it is called, you must reach exactly zero. In addition, the dart's score that brings you down to zero must be a double.


For example, if a player has 2 points left, they must score a double 1. If he/she has 18 points left, the player must score a double 9.
If a double is not possible, such as a remaining total of 19 points, a player can score a single 3 first to bring the total down to 16. From there, the player can score a double 8 to finish the game.

For Cricket, only focus on numbers 15-20, plus the bull's eye.,
Set up a chalk board next to the darts board.,
Know that if you have closed out a number which your opponent hasn't, and you hit that number, you are awarded that many points.,
Know that the person who finishes with all their numbers closed out and the most points wins.",How to Play Darts4," The object of the game is to ""close out"" numbers 15-20 each three times; or to hit a double of one number and a single of the same number; or to hit a triple.

, In order, list the numbers 15 through 20 so that you can check off when a player has hit all three, or closed out a number.

, For example, you've closed out 16 but your opponent hasn't; you hit the 16, which means you get 16 points.

, It's not just who finishes first — it's who closes out with the most points.


The green bull is worth 25 points and the red bull is worth 50.

Heat a small spot on an empty milk jug.,
Push a plumb bob into the center.,
Cut out the dimpled section.,
Sharpen a piece of metal tubing.,
Strike each cone out of the plastic.,
Push a nail through the the pointed end.,
Seal the nail in place.,
Let dry before use.",How to Make a Dart1," Use a small propane torch set to a low flame to heat a quarter-sized area on the side of the plastic jug. Continue heating the same spot until it turns clear.


Note that a quarter is just a little under 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, so the circular spot you heat should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm).
It might be easier to do this if the milk jug is on its side instead of standing upright.;
, Carefully and quickly press the pointed end of a plumb bob into the center of this soft spot. This should form a dimple in the plastic.


Hold the plumb bob in place just long enough for the dimple to become cloudy.
The spot should now look like a cone.

, Use scissors or a sharp knife to carefully cut away the side of the jug with the dimpled cone on it.


If you plan to make several darts, you should make several of these cones in the same manner before you cut out the wall of plastic. Make sure that you leave a little space in between each cone as you form them.

, Using a saw or similar tool, slice the end off a piece of electrical metallic tubing with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) diameter. Keep the cut end sharp.


This may not be necessary if you can find a piece of metallic tubing that already has a sharp end.
For ease of use, the tube should only be between 4 and 12 inches (10 and 30 cm) long.

, Center the sharp end of the tube over the plastic cone. Tap on the back of the tube with a hammer. The sharp edge of the tube should cut out the cone.


Keep the sheet of plastic on a hard surface that will not suffer from being struck or scraped. A wooden block would work well.
Make sure that the pointed side of the cone faces up during this process.

, Carefully yet firmly push the pointed end of a drywall nail through the point of the cone.


Push the nail through from the inside of the cone.
Slide the cone down the entire length of the nail until it reaches the blunt end.

, Apply a small dab of silicone sealant behind the metal nail at the base of the plastic cone.


Note that clay could be used instead of silicone sealant.
The sealant secures the structure of the dart while also sealing out any moisture or oil. It also gives the dart a little more weight, which will allow it to fly better.

, Once the sealant is dry and the two pieces are firmly set in place, the dart is ready to use.

Sit on a chair or cooler with your beer can between your legs.,
Take turns throwing darts at your opponent's beer can.,
Drink a sip of your beer if your can is struck.,
Drink to the hole if your beer can is punctured.,
Drink a sip of your own beer if you strike your opponent.,
Crown the winner when the game is complete.",How to Play Beer Darts," To set up a game of beer darts, each player must be in a seated or squatting stance.


In a tailgate setting, it is common for players to be seated on a cooler. Chairs or improvised seating can also be used.
Each player should begin with an opened but full can of beer. This can should be placed on the ground directly in between the player's feet.
In a 2-player game, each player should be facing the other player, separated by a distance of about 10 feet (3 m). If using a multiple-player variation, you could have players positioned in a circle.;
, The basic progression of the game involves each player throwing a single dart at their opponent's beer can in turn. The object is to puncture or at least strike the can with your dart.

, In beer darts, different actions are taken depending on how the dart strikes the beer can. If the dart contacts the beer can but does not puncture it, the struck player must take a small sip of their beer.

, When a beer can is punctured, it will begin to leak beer from the hole. In this case, the punctured player must ""drink to the hole,"" meaning to consume their beer so that the level of the liquid lies just below the hole.

, Of course, beer darts presents a risk of personal injury. If you throw a dart and it strikes any part of your opponent's body, you must take a sip of your own beer as a penalty.

, There are 2 ways to win a game of beer darts: either by puncturing your opponent's can 3 times, or by forcing them to consume their entire beer.


If your can receives 3 punctures, regardless of how much liquid remains in it, you have lost. Consume the remainder of your beer and cede your place to whomever wants to play the next round.
If you are forced to finish your beer, either by taking the final sip or because the can was punctured near the very bottom, you have lost.

Stretch apart the cotton fibers.,
Split the back of a bamboo skewer.,
Sharpen the tip of the skewer.,
Wedge a length of string into the split.Take a length of string 2 feet (61 cm) long and wedge one end of the string into the split in the back of the skewer.,
Position the cotton on the back of the dart.,
Wrap the string around the cotton.,
Tie off the string.,
Secure the knot with glue.,
Smooth out the fletching.",How to Make a Dart2," Gently pull apart a large clump of cotton, working it in several directions using your hands. Doing so stretches out the fibers.


The clump of cotton should be roughly the same size as the palm of your hand.
Raw cotton is the most traditional and works very well, but in a pinch, commercially packaged cotton balls will also be sufficient.

, Use a sharp knife to carefully split one end of a long bamboo skewer. The split should be no longer than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).


Center the split in the end of the skewer.
While a variety of wooden shafts would work well for the dart, standard bamboo skewers are the easiest to use. The wood is sturdy enough and the thickness of the skewer is just the right size., Carefully whittle or shave of portions of wood from the opposite end of the skewer to form the end into a point.


The actual point only needs to be 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm ) long.
Note that if you want a smaller dart, you should trim the skewer down to size before sharpening the end to a point.

,


The string should be roughly the same thickness as floss. Linen string, kite string, and yucca fiber are all good options.
Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of string hanging out from one side of the split. The remaining length of string should hang out from the opposite side.

, Grab the split end of the dart with your non-dominant hand and hold the stretched cotton fibers on top of it.


The cotton should extend over the top 2 inches (5 cm) or so of the wooden shaft.
Note that this process will take some balance. You will need to hold the center of the wooden skewer with your dominant hand while holding the long end of the string in between your teeth.

, Spin the wooden skewer away from you using your dominant hand, working slowly. The string should wind itself around the cotton and the skewer.


You will probably need to insert cotton fibers beneath the string as it winds around the skewer. Do this using your non-dominant hand and work with a few fibers at a time.
Continue until there are 2 inches (5 cm) of cotton fletching wrapped around the dart.
The winding process takes time and practice to master, so don't be discouraged if you don't get it right the first time.

, Wrap the string around the bottom of the fletching several times. Tie it into a knot, then tie another knot over it.


If done right, this should secure the cotton fletching in place.

, Apply a dot of super glue or hot glue over the knot to add another layer of security.

, Twirl the cotton fletching in between your fingers to ""fluff"" it, then use your fingers to smooth it back down.


If necessary, you can trim excess cotton with scissors or a sharp knife.
Once you finish smoothing out cotton, the dart is ready to use.

Cut out a square of paper.,
Roll the paper into a cone.,
Cover the cone in tape.,
Snip away the tip of the cone.,
Slide the nail through it.,
Glue the nail in place.,
Adhere six perler beads to the nail.,
Let dry before use.",How to Make a Dart3," Measure out a 3-inch (7.6-cm) square on a sheet of standard printer paper and cut it out.


Use a ruler to make sure that each side is straight and equal in length.
Another option is to use a standard square sticky note.

, Start at one corner and roll the paper square into itself, forming a small cone.


Apply even pressure as you roll the paper to form a tight cone.
You may need to apply a small strip of tape to the outer edge of the cone so that it holds its shape as you continue to work.

, Cover the entire outer side of the cone with a single layer of tape. Start at the tip and work your way up.


You can use standard office tape or duct tape.
Covering the cone in tape makes it more durable. This action also gives the cone more weight, which will give the dart more weight. The additional weight can help the dart fly better.

, Use scissors to cut a small round hole at the very tip of the cone.


The hole only needs to be large enough to allow a nail to just barely slip through. If the hole is too large, however, the nail can wobble around or fall out.

, Side the nail through the paper cone, pushing the pointed end through from the inside of the cone. Slide the cone down the length of the nail, leaving roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space in between the head of the nail and the inner tip of the cone.


Use a 11.5 gauge nail that is 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) long. It also needs to have a round head.
If the opening in the cone is too small, make it a little bigger. Do not allow the nail to tear through it.
If the nail can fall out of the cone on its own, however, the hole is too wide and you should start over.

, Apply a small dot of super glue just below the head of the nail. Slide the cone down the remaining section of nail, into the glue and on top of the nail head.


Pull carefully yet firmly to make sure that the glue adheres to the cone.
Allow the glue to dry before you continue.

, Apply a thin dot of super glue to the cone side of the nail, then slide a total of six perler beads onto the nail and into the glue.


The perler beads add weight to the dart. This weight can make the darts more stable, which improves their ability to fly.
These beads should be fitted next to the cone and along the middle of the nail so that they remain visible.
Alternate back and forth between applying glue and slipping beads on.
If you have difficulty getting the beads on using your fingers, you may need to slide them on using pliers.

, Allow the glue to dry completely. Once it dries, the dart is ready to throw.

,,, This is important because when the marker falls after you throw it, it will stain the floor. The paper will stop the marker from staining the ground.

, You may have as many as 5 players. Not only that, but you can also play independently by yourself.

, If you are playing the game with other kids, stand in a straight line about 1 foot behind the first person in line (just in case of any accidents.) Each player must have a different colored washable marker, so when the marker tip hits the target, you know which one is yours.

, When it's your turn, step back at least 3 feet away from the target. Take your marker, and hold the tip at a steady aim for the target. If you are having trouble figuring out if your aim is too high or too low, ask another player to guide you.

, When you feel like your aim is on point, carefully, but not too softly, throw your marker at the target and try to score it right in the middle.


Each person should get to throw a marker at the dart 3 times, so there are 3 rounds

, Remember the numbers you labeled the target with earlier? Those numbers are the points that you score. The goal of the game is to try to score the closest or exactly on the 5-point circle on the target.

Create the throwline.",How to Hang a Dartboard," Find an open space that you will not be inhibited by furniture or other obstacles. The space needs to be about 5 feet wide and 11 feet long. Don’t get distracted by furniture or obstacles along the throwing path. Try to keep the area clear so you can easily retrieve the darts after each throw.Keep in mind that you will also need space for spectators and players. Make space right beside the board for a scoreboard so that it is easily in sight for everyone enjoying the game.;
, Depending on your budget, you may not have the opportunity to create custom floors for your darts. Keep in mind that different materials can easily damage your darts or generally fade from general play. Ideally, use a dart mat, which is a roll out rubber mat specifically designed to protect your floors, protect your darts from dulling, and mark the proper distance from the throw line.Dart points can easily break or dull on concrete, stone, or tile floors.
Wood floors will easily be punctured especially the area closest to the board.
Linoleum and vinyl flooring are also prone to get a lot of holes.
Carpet may easily fade and show the wear of foot traffic between the dart board and the throwing line.

, You may not have checked since you first moved into your home so be sure that your floor is level. Some houses may slope over time or flooring may warp. If you are using a dart mat, you may be able to compensate for any irregularity by placing cardboard or carpet to even out the throwing area., Place the dart board in a safe and isolated location. Keep the dart board away from doorways or high traffic areas with breakable objects. You don’t want to injure anyone walking through the path of the dart, nor do you want to have to keep pausing the game as people cannot help but go through your area. If there are any fragile or valuable objects that can possibly be damaged, rethink where you should set up your game.Darts can be unpredictable and ricochet at any direction so don’t place your dartboard near windows or any area that can surprise unsuspecting passersby., Depending on how experienced the players are, darts may not always hit the board. Use a protective board to save the wall and surrounding area. Depending on your time and budget, you may also house your board by buying or creating a protective layer or cabinet.


Beginners usually miss below the dart board so creating a cabinet or protective layer that measures 3′ wide x 4′ high backboard as you mount the dartboard in the upper center.If you do not have the time or money to get a cabinet, you can also use a large piece of foam, plywood, or cork behind the dartboard.
Complete cabinets and protective materials can often be bought at your local sports or hobby stores.

, Official rules states that the center of the bullseye needs to be exactly 5 feet 8 inches high from the floor. Quality boards are hung from the center while others may be hung from the top. If you have a board that is hung from the top, measure the distance from the hanger to the center of the bullseye and add that to 5 feet 8 inches in order to get the correct height at which you should hang your dartboard.If your dart board is already encased in a protective cabinet or mount, measure from the center of the bullseye to your highest mounting point and add to 5 feet 8 inches. Center your board within the cabinet or mount., Face the counter sink towards you and place the backing board disc at the back center of the board. Screw the center hole in place followed by any other guide holes. Most dart boards will have 3 other holes to securely fasten the board into place.

, Remember to place the wall bracket so that that the center of the bullseye will be at 5 feet 8 inches from the ground. The wall bracket should have the opening to the top of the U shaped recess facing you. Screw once the center mark lines up with the center hole of the wall bracket. This will be removed later as it will only be used to ensure that the other brackets are level.


Use a level for the bracket and 4 C screws then remove the centre screw once all brackets are level.







, Line up your dart board by keeping the 20 scoring area vertical as you place the dartboard into the wall bracket. Make sure the disc is attached.


Once the brackets are mounted, align the board and drop it into the wall brackets.
Mount the board flush to the wall not slanted like a picture., Make the throw line (also called the oche, toe-line, or hockey) 3 feet wide and 7 feet 9.25 inches from the face of a standard steel tipped set up or 8 feet from a soft tipped board. You may use tape, a piece of wood or metal, or even a store bought throw-line sticker.Ensure the throwline is centered and perpendicular to the face of the board. Measure from each corner of the line to the bullseye to ensure the throwline is perpendicular and correct distance."

Many cultures have riddle traditions. Viking and Anglo-Saxon riddles are still very popular with English speakers, even though they were first told more than a thousand years ago! These riddles often have simple solutions such as “key” or “onion,” but are told in a creative way. You can find many collections online.Riddles are also quite popular in modern fantasy literature, movies, and TV. J.R.R. Tolkien’s book The Hobbit has a whole chapter devoted to “Riddles in the Dark” told between two characters.;
, Riddles can be about anything you can imagine, but physical objects that people are familiar with are very, very common topics.


Other topics are natural phenomena like a storm or snow, an animal, or an action.
Avoid topics that are very abstract or require specialized knowledge.

, Some riddles are very short, just a phrase or two, while others are more like a miniature story. You can make your riddle to be any length you want, but it shouldn’t be so long that your audience can’t follow it.


Here is an example of a very short riddle from the Anglo-Saxon ‘’Book of Exeter’’, written in the 900s AD: “A wonder on the wave / water became bone.” (Answer: ice on a lake.)
Here is an example of a longer riddle from the Book of Exeter: “When I am alive I do not speak. / Anyone who wants to takes me captive and cuts off my head. / They bite my bare body / I do no harm to anyone unless they cut me first. / Then I soon make them cry.” (Answer: an onion.)

, Once you have the solution of of your riddle, you will work backward to creating the riddle. Try to choose something easy to personify, as personification (the ascription of human-like qualities to non-human things) is a very common technique in riddle-making.


For example, you could choose ""a pencil"" as your solution, because most people will be familiar with it.

, Compile these ideas in a list. Try to think of verbs and adjectives, in particular. Think of synonyms with multiple meanings and write them down.


For ""pencil,"" some items for your list could include: ""No. 2"" (the most common type of writing pencil)), ""wood,"" ""rubber,"" ""yellow,"" ""pink hat"" (the eraser), ""looks like the letter 'l' or the number '1'"" (physical aspects of the pencil's shape).
You could also include other aspects of your pencil: for example, it needs to be sharpened as it writes which means it will get shorter over time the more it's used (a possible paradox).
Another common trick is to think of things your item can do: for example, a pencil is small but contains all things (because you can write ""all things"" with a pencil).

, Riddles use metaphors to describe familiar things in unfamiliar ways. Think about the list of ideas you created in the last step. If your solution is “pencil,” think of words you could use to create a metaphorical description: “hand-stick” or “yellow sword” are fanciful, but still offer clues to the solution.


Here is a riddle that uses metaphor to describe a pencil: ""A golden sword that wears a rosy hat, it is two trees, both Number 1 and Number 2.""
The pencil is a ""sword"" because it is pointed sharply at one end. This description also plays with the common saying, ""The pen is mightier than the sword,"" and may help provide a clue. The ""rosy hat"" refers to the eraser.
The ""two trees"" are cedar (the most common type of wood used for pencils),and rubber (the type of tree that produces rubber for erasers).
The pencil looks like the numeral ""1"" but is actually a ""#2"" pencil. This description is a double pun, because the #2 pencil is actually the most common, or ""number one,"" type of pencil.

, Riddles were originally a form of oral literature, rather than written down, so think of how the riddle sounds when you say it. Try not to bog down your riddle with elaborate words or abstract concepts.


For example, a simply worded riddle involving a pencil could be: ""This thing is small but contains all things; the longer it goes, the shorter it gets.""
Here is an example of a famous riddle from The Hobbit that uses simple, descriptive language: “A box without hinges, key, or lid, / Yet golden treasure inside is hid.” (Answer: an egg.)

, Another way to make a catchy riddle is to write it as though your solution (the answer to the riddle) is speaking about itself. Start the riddle with “I” and a verb.


For example, this riddle about a pencil uses personification as well as metaphor: ""I wear a rosy hat but have no head; I'm sharp but have no brain. I can say anything, but will never speak a word.""

, Because riddles are often shared orally, paying attention to how the language sounds will help you make a better riddle. Techniques such as alliteration (using the same letter sounds throughout the riddle) and rhyme help make it easier to tell and listen to your riddle.


For example, ""I wear a rosy hat but have no head"" uses ""h"" to create a pleasing alliteration.
Here is a very poetic riddle whose solution is a common tool: “I drink the blood of the Earth, / and the trees fear my roar, / yet a man may hold me in his hands.” (Answer: a chainsaw.)Sometimes riddles also use “kennings,” which are poetic, figurative descriptions of something simple -- a riddle within a riddle! In the above riddle, the “blood of the Earth” is gas, which a chainsaw uses for power.This was a very common technique in Viking riddles.

, The best way to know if the riddle you’ve made works is to share it with your friends and family and ask them to guess the answer. Sharing your riddles with family and friends may even convince them to make up riddles of their own!

, If your friends and family guess the answer immediately, you may want to go back and make the riddle a little more metaphorical. If they have too much trouble guessing the answer, you may need to tweak the wording to make the answer more evident.

Finish the game.",How to Play 20 Questions1," Each person plays a slightly different variation of 20 Questions. Know who you're playing with, what rules they adhere to, and come to an agreement.









The questioner generally gives the category forthright; however, he/she has two options:

Is it an animal (alive and breathing)? A vegetable (does it grow?) Or mineral (isn't alive, doesn't grow, comes from the ground)? This version can be a bit tricky as one object can fit a couple different categories (like a leather belt).
Is it a person, place, or thing? This variation is much more straightforward, though it opens up more abstract ideas, like ""San Francisco.""


The players can establish whether or not the object must be in sight. This is better for shorter games or those with goldfish-like attention spans.
Some players are kind enough to volunteer a guess at the end of the 20 questions asked if the object has yet to be determined. Sort of a ""Hail Mary"" type of thing.
Responses can be a straight ""yes"" or ""no"" answer, or include adverbs like, ""usually,"" ""sometimes,"" or ""rarely.""
Someone must keep track of the number of questions asked. This is usually whoever has their hands free to hold up the appropriate amount of fingers.;
, The game is started and you have no idea how to guess. Going from ""Is it bigger than an elephant?"" to ""Does it smell better than a skunk?"" is not going to help you. Start big and get smaller.









Begin with a general question, like ""Is it bigger than a breadbox?"" If the answer is yes, ask another along the same pattern (""Is it bigger than a refrigerator?""). When you get a no, stop. Go along a different route (color, etc.) until you can combine two pieces of information.

, Starting out with narrow questions will just guarantee you a handful of head shakes. Think bigger, broader questions (at least to start with) to get a yes, leading you on the correct path.









For example, a question such as ""Does it involve technology for communications, entertainment or work?""is a carefully thought out question. If yes, you can narrow it down from there. If no, you have eliminated a whole bunch of possible prospects.

, Your second question should not be, ""Is it a goat?!"" Unless you can read the other person's mind, this probably isn't going to happen. Only guess when you have a pretty good idea.









That being said, once you start getting nearer to the 20 mark, save a couple rounds for guesses. Each one counts as a turn! And if you've absolutely no idea by number 16 or 17, shoot away.

If you had no idea because the object at hand was the questioner's pinky toe on their right foot, that is grounds for an objection. Speak up! That's unfair game play.



, If you won (guessed the object within 20 questions), it's time for vengeance! It's now your turn to choose an object and your partner guesses.









If you didn't guess the object in 20 guesses, think about your questions and start guessing in a second game. Now that you know how the other plays, how can you change your strategy?

, Simply press a length of tape sticky-side down over the point of the pin, place the pin against the blunt end of the pencil, and wrap the tape down over the sides to secure the pin in place. Apply additional pieces of tape if necessary.

, Fold two more post-its and arrange them so that all three creases meet in the middle, forming a three-pointed wing on the end of the dart. Tape the papers together. Repeat steps 2 and 3 on the remaining pencils.

, Draw or print out a picture of a dart board (or your nemesis) and pin it up on a bulletin board or soft cubicle wall. The soft backing will allow the darts to stick when thrown. Then start playing darts.

Go over the rules.,
Think of an object.,
Give accurate answers.,
Deem a winner.",How to Play 20 Questions2," Sometimes each player has grown up knowing a slightly different set of game play. Outline the basics before you start thinking and guessing.









What kind of categories does the questioner start with? Will you have to start or will the guesser ask?

Choose between the following: animal (it's alive and breathing), vegetable (it grows), and mineral (it's not alive and comes from the ground) or person, place, and thing. AVM can lead to technicalities (is a wooden table a vegetable or a mineral?) but PPT opens up the entire world (the Seattle Space Needle).


Does the object have to be in sight? In the room? Or anywhere?
Will you allow a final guess as a sort of 21st question?
Are answers strictly limited to yes/no, or do they include ""sometimes,"" ""usually,"" or ""rarely?""
Who's keeping track? Are you monitoring their questions or are they monitoring their own?

, It's best to go outside yourself a bit and think of an object neither party has on the brain. Pick an object that both parties are familiar with and is improbable but definitely not impossible.









Do not pick your younger sister's diary she hides under her bed. There is no way the guesser will ever get that. It's just not fun.
If you're obsessed with Star Trek, don't choose Star Trek. If Garfield wants to fool Odie, he's not going to choose lasagna. Pick something your partner doesn't expect--especially if it's a friend who knows you well.

, If you don't know the answer to a question, you may make a guess, but let them know you're not entirely sure. Don't lead them down the wrong path.









Don't think too much. If they ask you, ""Is it bigger than a refrigerator?"" don't reply, ""Maybe? What size refrigerator are you referring to?"" Think in standards. If you don't think too much, you'll stay on the same page.

, On the 20th question (and remember: guesses count!), the game is over. If they haven't read your mind, you win! Time to fool them again.









If they did guess the object, hand them over the rights to be the questioner. Hopefully they'll be as nice to you as you were to them.

HAVE
HATE.

, Any longer and it gets a bit unwieldy although for a very clever group, that might be a good thing!

, About 10 should suffice for a good round from which you can draw a clear winner.

, Give them their pen and paper. Set the first word for them to change. Tell them something like:


""Change the word LOVE to HATE in as few changes as possible.""
You might need to demonstrate this on a whiteboard or piece of paper on the wall first. A good one to use is changing CAT to DOG: CAT -> COT -> DOT -> DOG.

, You could add variations in to the game depending on age, so that players have to rearrange letters or come up with particular acronyms or such.

, You can award the winner as the person who managed to make the most accurate changes (some players won't even manage that much) or to the winner who has the least changes to reach the target word. And it's a very good idea to award a small prize to everyone for trying.

Prepare the scorecard.,
Determine batting order.,
Hit the right target.,
Count runs correctly.",How to Play Baseball Darts1," Before you begin playing baseball darts, prepare the scoreboard. To do so, you'll have to list all the player's names.


Write the numbers 1 through 9 on the lefthand side of the scoreboard.Across the top of the board, write the names of all the players.;
, Before you can start playing baseball, you'll need to determine the batting order. That refers to the order the players compete. Have each player throw a dart on the board. The player closest to the bullseye goes first. The player furthest away goes last., To score in baseball, you need to hit the right section a dart board. A dart board is sectioned off, sort of like a pizza. There are numbers written along the side of the board. Each slice has a different number.


To play baseball darts, you try to hit the slice of the dart board corresponding to the inning of the game. For example, if you're in the first inning all the darts you throw need to land in the slice of the dart board marked ""1.""
Darts outside the region for that inning do not count towards your score. For example, if a dart hits the 7th section of the board during the 8th inning you will not get any points for that dart., In baseball, your points are referred to as your ""runs."" Where your dart falls makes a difference in scoring runs. A dart board has two rings: the double ring and the triple ring. The double ring is the outermost ring on the dart board and is the circle that essentially outlines the board. The triple ring is the circle in the center of the board, about halfway between the bullseye and the double ring.In baseball, if a dart hits the triple ring you get three runs. If a dart hits the double ring, you get two runs. Anywhere else your dart hits on the slice of the dart board corresponding with the inning counts as a single run.
To make this clear, let's look at an example. Say you're in the second inning. You throw your three darts. Your first dart hits the triple ring, your second hits the double ring, and the last dart falls in the ""2"" section of the dart board but does not make it into either ring. You would get 3 runs for the first dart, 2 runs for the second, and one run for the last. Your score for that round would be 6.

"
"
Throw 3 darts per player each inning.,
Add up your score at the end of each turn.,
Consider adding a twist in the 7th inning.",How to Play Baseball Darts2," In each inning, the player throws three darts. As you throw the darts, aim for the number that corresponds with the inning. Also, keep in mind you get more runs if you get your darts inside of the rings of the dart board. Aim for the rings as well., At the end of each turn, add up your score. As the innings progress, add your scores together. For example, say you scored 5 runs in the first inning and a 2 runs in the second. By the end of the second inning, you have 7 runs. Keep adding runs to your total score as you go. Whoever has the most runs after 9 rounds wins., Some people like to play with a special ""7 inning stretch rule."" Players who do not score any runs in the 7th inning will have their total score cut in half. This can make the game more fun as it adds some tension. However, if you and your friends are new to the game this may only add frustration. It can take awhile to aim and throw darts correctly, making scores very low when beginners are playing baseball darts. The 7th inning rule is best used for more proficient players."

With meditation, you want to ensure that you remain fully awake.;
, Besides increasing your physical strength and flexibility, yoga changes your brain. Research suggests that in addition to reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, yoga protects the brain from shrinking with age.Interestingly, yoga prevents shrinking mainly in the left hemisphere of the brain, which is associated with positive emotions such as joy and happiness.Along with meditating, yoga will also help you be more present — or “mindful” — in your everyday life., Research shows that exercise can help offset the cognitive decline brought on by aging and increasingly sedentary lifestyles.It’s also an effective stress reducer that helps improve your mood and boost your self-confidence.Studies recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity such as brisk walking, or 75 minutes each week of vigorous activity such as jogging.Choose something you enjoy — if you hate running, don’t force yourself to run three times a week; swim or join an exercise class or sports club instead.
Be realistic about how often you can exercise. If you know you can’t do 30 minutes of walking each day, 5 days a week, break it into smaller increments of 10 minutes here and there., On average, adults need between 7.5 and 9 hours of sleep each night; children and teenagers need even more (between 8.5 and 18 hours, depending on their age).When we consistently sleep poorly, we are more likely to suffer from stress, anxiety, poor memory, and many other undesirable conditions.If you are meditating daily, doing yoga, and exercising regularly, you should find it less difficult to sleep at night.
Give yourself at least 30 minutes at the end of the day to wind down before sleeping. Lie in bed and spend 20 minutes on progressive muscle relaxation, or read a book.
Avoid looking at screens (computer, TV, phone, tablet) before bed.When you sleep, your brain consolidates information into your long-term memory bank. When you aren’t getting enough sleep, it affects your brain’s ability to do this, and your memory suffers., It’s easy to get stressed out when you can’t find your keys or some important paperwork, or when you walk into your home and feel as though you’re drowning in clutter. Choosing specific places for everything and then consistently putting them away will help reduce the stress in your life, and will keep your mind free to focus on other things (like increasing your memory!).


You don’t have to do everything at once. Start with small things like keeping your keys in a tray or hook by the door, or making a commitment to always putting away your coat, shoes, and bag the moment you get home.
If you have a lot to do, making a to-do list will help quiet your mind and keep you on track.

, Spend time with people whose company you enjoy, and who make you feel like the best version of you. Socializing can decrease anxiety, boost self-confidence, and distract us from the things that stress us out.If you don’t have any friends/family or are living far away from your friends/family, consider joining a club or online community, or calling your friends/family using an online video chat program.

, Research suggests that laughter can improve short-term memory in older adults.It also increases endorphins and boosts the immune system, lowering stress and improving memory amongst all age groups.Watch comedic films or YouTube videos, share jokes with friends, attend a stand-up comedy show — do things that make you laugh on a regular basis.

, Go to a spa or, if you’re on a budget, give yourself a spa day at home. Take a bath or a nice shower, use a nice face mask, clip your nails and toenails, scrub your feet, slather yourself in a nice moisturizer after your bath/shower. Take time to focus on making yourself feel good; feel proud of yourself for taking care of yourself.


If you can’t afford to pay for a massage, ask a friend or your partner to trade massages with you.

, Cutting down on your use of technology (i.e. sitting in front of your computer, phone, or tablet) for even 30 minutes can improve your brain health and help you think more deeply.Spending time away from your computer makes you less likely to engage in working outside of business hours. It also helps you stay more present in the moment, and buys you time to do stress-relieving things like exercising or meditating., If you are consistently anxious and stressed out, and/or unable to sleep, consider seeing a medical professional. You may find that counselling (with a registered clinical counsellor or a psychologist) is all that you need, or you may choose to take a medication, or perhaps you'll combine the two. Speak with your doctor about what the best choice is for you.

, Studies have shown that blueberries in particular help protect the brain and may reduce the effects of age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Aim for 1 cup of blueberries a day; they can be fresh, frozen, or freeze-dried.Pomegranates (or pomegranate juice without added sugar) are also a good source of antioxidants., Many fish, including salmon, are rich in the omega-3 essential fatty acids that are necessary for brain function. These acids also reduce inflammation. Aim for a 4-ounce serving 2 to 3 times per week.Avocados offer another source of healthy fat — monounsaturated, which helps lower blood pressure and contributes to healthy blood flow., Nuts and seeds are great sources of vitamin E, which can help minimize the cognitive decline that accompanies age. Aim for 1 ounce each day of nuts or unhydrogenated nut butters. Raw or roasted doesn’t matter, but be careful of salt content., Eating whole grains promotes cardiovascular health, which promotes blood flow throughout the entire body, including the brain. Aim for 1/2 cup of whole-grain cereal, 1 to 3 slices of bread, or 2 tablespoons of wheat germ each day., Beans help stabilize blood sugar (glucose), upon which the brain depends for fuel. Aim for 1/2 cup of beans every day., Aim for 2 to 3 cups per day of either hot or cold tea. The small amount of caffeine that tea contains can help enhance memory, focus and mood. Tea also contains antioxidants.Make sure the tea is loose leaf or in a tea bag: bottled or powdered teas are not effective.
If you suffer from stress, you may need to reduce your caffeine intake as this can increase your anxiety/stress.

, Dark chocolate contains antioxidants and several natural stimulants, including caffeine, to enhance focus and concentration, and boost one’s mood. Aim for 1/2 to 1 ounce (but no more than that) per day., The brain is made up of roughly 80% water; when your brain is chronically dehydrated, it does not function properly. To calculate how much water you need to drink each day, take your weight in pounds and divide it by 2. That is how much water you should drink each day, in ounces.If you weight 150 pounds, you'll need to drink 75 ounces of water each day.
You may need to drink more water on days where you sweat more, for example, from exercise or hot weather.

, There is not enough scientific research to prove that any of the popular “brain boosting” supplements actually work. Ones that have potential include ginkgo biloba (improves blood flow), omega-3 fatty acids, Huperzine A, Acetyl-L-carnitine, vitamin E, and Asian/Panax ginseng., When you are mindful, you are living in the moment. Your mind is not focused on the past or present, but on the here and now. Being mindful also means acknowledging your thoughts, feelings, and present situation without judgment.Don’t: Earlier today, someone budged in front of you in line at the grocery store. You thought about saying something, but decided against it. Now you can’t stop thinking about how angry you felt at that moment; you practise over and over again in your mind the things you wish you had said to that person.
Do: Whenever the angry memory of that person budging in front of you pops into your head, acknowledge it but then let it go. Think, “yes, I felt angry then, but I don’t have to waste time feeling angry now,” and then return your awareness to the present moment. In a sense, being mindful means getting out of your head (and into the moment)!

, This is connected to being mindful. Practise making a mental photograph of your surroundings. Really pay attention to the things around you — the colours, the smells, the people, the weather. Live in the moment.

, Studies have shown that your brain cannot efficiently switch between tasks, meaning that when you multitask, you actually lose time. Research has also shown that we are less likely to retain what we learn when we’re multitasking. In short, if you want to remember something, don’t do it while multitasking!, Learn a language, play an instrument, increase your vocabulary — learning new things will keep your brain on its toes, so to speak. When we do the same things every day, our brain doesn’t receive the stimulation it needs to grow, so be sure to introduce new things regularly.You might also try learning different ways of using your senses — for example, brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand (if you’re right-handed, use your left) or turning a book upside down and reading it that way for 10 minutes.

, Studies show that using multiple senses helps us better understand and remember new concepts.If you want to remember something, visualize it, write it down, and say it out loud.


If you are trying to remember someone’s name, visualize them with their name written on their head. As you do this, say their name out loud.
If you are trying to memorize a language, pick 10 to 20 words to remember each day, and write each of them out 10 times while saying them out loud. You might even do this a few times until you can write and say each word perfectly, without having to think about it.
Flash cards are a good example of how you can enlist visualization, writing, and speaking to create memories; they are a wonderful tool for studying.

, If you want to help a memory stick in your brain, say it out loud as you complete the activity associated with it.


When you meet someone new, say their name as you shake their hand (“Hi Sam”), then say it again when you finish the conversation (“It was nice meeting you, Sam”) or, if that feels weird, you can say it quietly to yourself as you walk away., On the way out the door in the morning, you remember that when you get home you need to do laundry. Instead of writing yourself a note or starting laundry before you go, you can do something like leave a shoe out in your hallway (if your hallway is usually empty/tidy, that is). Simply seeing that shoe out of place should spark the memory of wanting to do laundry., Your brain can only process so much information at a time; reduce what you want to learn into bite-sized chunks, so to speak. To ensure that you use your memory as effectively as possible, prioritize what you want to memorize, and start with the most important information.It’s important to give yourself the time and space to properly remember things. We often need time just to process information before we can properly use it.Instead of remembering the number, 5-6-2-2-8-9-7, make it 562-28-97., Throughout the day, give yourself little tests — for example, when you leave a restaurant, ask yourself to describe what your server looked like: his/her hair, eyes, shirt colour, name (if there was a name tag).

, Your brain may get slower with age, but it is still possible to learn new things and to improve your brain’s function."

Measure out your rope.,
Make a loop at the end.,
Make opposite side slits in all three tennis balls.,
Connect all three tennis balls and knot the end.",How to Make a Rope Dart1," There are many different styles that can be adapted to different lengths of rope dart. Generally speaking, to get the most versatility out of your rope dart you should first measure out a distance that spans fingertip to fingertip with your arms outstretched. Hold your rope at this length, and then add to it the distance between your shoulder and the floor.Leave yourself some extra slack, so that you can fashion a loop at the end for easier handling.
Extra rope is also important in case you find a long rope style suits you best.
Making your rope dart too long can result in damage caused by the head of your dart dragging on the ground. This will decrease the life of your rope dart.;
, You'll want the loop to be big enough to fit your hand, but not so big that it's clumsy or bulky.A bowline knot will be ideal for making a sturdy loop in the end of your line. To make a bowline knot:


Form a loop where you want the base of your loop to be. The length between your loop and the end of your rope will form your handle.
Thread the end of your line up through the loop.
Bring the end behind the line and back down through the loop.
Pull tight to fasten the knot securely., Open the blade on your multi-tool or take a sharp knife and slit each ball once on opposing sides with your cutting tool. The slits should be big enough so that, when squeezed, the ball allows enough room for the rope to feed through.Be careful not to make your slit too big. Doing so could result in your tennis ball falling apart.

, One at a time, thread each tennis ball by squeezing the sides to force the slit you have made to gape open. Then, feed the loose end of your rope through to the other side and do the same for your next two tennis balls.


Tie off the end of your line with a simple knot to prevent your tennis balls from coming loose.
The tennis balls on the end will simulate the weight and drag caused by an actual rope dart head, which is traditionally made of metal.

"
Measure your rope dart's line.,
Attach rings to your dart.,
Tie a short length of ribbon to the last ring.,
Affix a flag or feathers near dart.This practice, in addition to providing the same drag created by ribbon/streamers, historically has also been used to conceal the dart in combat.,
Connect your rope to your dart.,
Create a loop in the end or fashion a handle.",How to Make a Rope Dart2," Take your rope or fine chain in each hand and stretch out your arms to either side. Hold your rope or chain at the measure of this distance and add to this length the distance between your shoulder and the floor. This is the ideal length for the line of your rope dart.Add a little extra length to your rope dart, six inches (15.25 cm) should be more than enough, if you want to add a handle to the end of your line opposite your dart.

, Your rings can be made of tied cloth, or you could use needle nose pliers to bend metal rings onto your dart. Metal rings can be purchased at your local hardware store and will create a jingling noise when you practice with your rope dart.


In either case, take your rings and attach them to the base of the dart.
Depending on your dart, you may be able to thread your rings through a gap in the base.
You may have to knot/bend your rings onto the base of your dart.
Traditionally, four to five rings are attached to the dart.

, Streamers or ribbons, along with other accents, were tied to the dart is to stop blood from making the rest of the line slippery and create drag as well.Both these allow for better control and manipulation in and out of combat.


Six inches (15¼ cm) should be a sufficient length for your ribbon.

, Bright, colorful flags and feathers would distract adversaries on the battlefield, making the rope dart more effective.By adding a flag or feather to your rope dart, you'll also make your practice more visually pleasing to those observing you. The bright colors will create shapes as you swing the rope dart.
If you are using a stake for your dart, it may not penetrate into targets like a real rope dart would. To correct this, you can sharpen your stake with your knife.

, If the end of your dart has a space where you can thread your rope and tie a simple knot, do so with your line.If no such space exists, you might use a another knot, like a pile hitch, which can be tired by:


Looping the dart end of your line.
Wrapping the loop once around the base of your dart.
Crossing the loop over top your line.
Sliding the loop over the end of your dart and down to join where the loop wraps., A simple handle can be made by sliding a thick wooden bead onto the end of your rope dart and adding a simple knot to the end of the line to keep the bead in place. You can also tie off the end of your rope dart in a loop to serve as a handle by tying a bowline knot:


Form a loop where you want the base of your loop to be. The length between your loop and the end of your rope will form your handle.
Thread the end of your line up through the loop.
Bring the end behind the line and back down through the loop.
Pull tight to fasten the knot securely."

, The answers are often illogical, making puns, jokes, or pop culture references instead of answering the question seriously. Some of them are even intentionally misspelled words to make bad jokes (""armies"" instead of ""arms"").

, Read the question word by word. Is there an obvious meaning – so obvious you hadn't thought of it? For example, if you're told to ""Click the answer,"" literally click the words ""the answer.""


A supposed typo or misspelling might actually be a hint.

, The more people working together, the more likely you'll get the answer. Friends who know internet memes and pop culture references are especially helpful, since some of the questions are references to movies, songs, or memes that the game developer thought were funny back in 2006 and 2007.

, If you have to guess, write down the answer you're going to guess before you click it. Cross it out if it was wrong, and circle it if you were right. If you lose all your lives and have to restart the game (and it's a miracle if this doesn't happen), you'll be glad you wrote down your last guess so you have fewer options to choose from next time.

Using shorter words will allow you to include more words in your puzzle. Word searches generally have 10-20 words. If you are making a very large puzzle, you could have more than that.


Examples of words for the theme ‘animals’: dog, cat, monkey, elephant, fox, sloth, horse, jellyfish, donkey, lion, tiger, bear (oh my!), giraffe, panda, cow, chinchilla, meerkat, dolphin, pig, coyote, etc.

, Do this particularly if you are using more obscure words or the names of foreign countries. Misspelling words will lead to confusion (and someone potentially giving up on your puzzle.)

Assign words for the letters.,
Make a story out of the words.,
Visualize your story.,
Recite the story.",How to Learn the Alphabet Backwards1," Many children learn the alphabet by linking words and images to the letters, but you can do the same for each letter, assign a word that starts with that letter. For example, let “m” stand for mouse and “l” stand for log. Try to choose words you can imagine as vividly as possible.It’s okay if you can’t think of the right word just yet. When you start rehearsing the letters, you may find words that work better for you.;
, Working from Z to A, combine your words. Make the words flow into one another when you can. For instance, you can think of a mouse leaping onto a log next to a king, who jumps up with his ice cream. The keywords in your story, such as mouse and log, will tell you that the letter order is m, l, k, j, i.While some people can learn the alphabet backwards by simply recalling a list of words, creating a vivid story is a more powerful mnemonic device.

, As you go through the story, try to imagine it in as much detail as possible. The more vivid the images, the more easily you’ll recall what comes next. Refine the words you use as you go to make your story more memorable to yourself., Once you have a concrete story imagined, start at Z and go all the way to A. Recall and visualize each word, taking out the letters starting the keywords when you reach them. With practice, you’ll be able to recite the alphabet backwards.

Throw paper against a male opponent.,
Throw rock against a female opponent.,
Look for your opponent using the same move twice in a row.,
Suggest a throw to your opponent when explaining the game.","How to Win at Rock, Paper, Scissors1"," Inexperienced males statistically lead with rock most often for their first move in the game. By throwing paper on your first move against them, you’ll likely win.


Rock is the statistically most often thrown move at 35.4%.;
, Most women tend to lead with scissors, so if you throw out a rock on the first play of the game you can beat your opponent.

Scissors is the throw that is least often used with only a 29.6% chance of being thrown in a Rock, Paper, Scissors game., If your opponent plays the same move twice in a row, they’re not likely to use it a third time. So, you can assume they won’t throw that move. Put out a move that will give you either a win or stalemate, guaranteeing you won’t lose.


For example, if your opponent throws out scissors twice in a row you can assume they won’t play it a third time. They’ll either play rock or paper. You should then throw paper because it will either beat your opponent’s rock or be a stalemate against their paper., If your rookie opponent needs a quick review of the rules, use hand gestures to subconsciously suggest to them their first move.

For example, when explaining that rock beats scissors, use the scissors gesture to show this (instead of rock), and then use the scissors gesture again when explaining that scissors beats paper. This will have the scissors gesture in your opponent’s mind and they’ll likely subconsciously play it first. Be prepared with a rock move to beat them."

Leave space at the top of your page.,
Draw a grid by hand.,
Use a ruler to draw lines.",How to Make a Word Search2," You will want to add a title to your word search once you have drawn your grid. If you have a theme, you can title your word search accordingly. If you don’t have a theme, simply write ‘Word Search’ across the top of your page.


You can also make your grid on the computer. To make a grid in versions of word prior to Word 2007: Select ‘View’ at the top of the page. Select ‘Toolbars’ and make sure the ‘Drawing’ toolbar is selected. Click on ‘Draw’ (it looks like an ‘A’ with a cube and a cylinder). Click ‘Draw’ and then click ‘Grid’. A grid option box will pop up--make sure you select ‘Snap to Grid’ and then select any other options you would like for your grid. Click ‘OK’ and make your grid.

To make a grid in Word 2007: Click ‘Page Layout’ at the top of the page and click the ‘Align’ list within the ‘Arrange’ grouping. Click ‘Grid settings’ and make sure ‘Snap to Grid’ is selected. Select any other options you want for your grid. Click ‘ok’ and draw your grid.

, It is easiest to make word searches when using graph paper, although you do not have to use graph paper. The standard word search box is 10 squares by 10 squares. Draw a square that is 10 centimeter (3.9 in) by 10 centimeter (3.9 in) and then make a line at each centimeter across the box. Mark each centimeter going down the box as well.


You do not need to use a 10x10 grid. You can make your grid as big or as small as you like, just remember that you need to be able to draw small squares within your grid. You can make your grid into the shape of a letter (perhaps the letter of the person’s name who you are making it for?) or into an interesting shape.

, Use a pencil to draw the lines evenly and straightly. You need to create small, evenly-sized squares within your grid. The squares can be as big or as small as you like.


If you are giving the word search to a child, you might consider making the squares larger. Making larger squares will make the puzzle a bit easier because each individual square and letter will be easier to see. To make your puzzle harder, make smaller, closer together squares.

Combine letters.,
Fill in the gaps for difficult sequences.,
Visualize a story.,
Add a melody to the words.,
Recite your story.",How to Learn the Alphabet Backwards2," Chunking is a mnemonic device that helps you remember groups of letters. Look at the alphabet backwards. Notice whatever letters go together to form words. For example, f, e, d are all in a row. The word “fed” is easier to remember than the individual letters.This is similar to combining words except you’re combining letters without initial images. Because it doesn’t involve as many images, it may increase your recall speed.

, Some letter sequences won’t translate directly to words like “fed.” To do this, try a more creative approach. One way to do is to make a sound out of the letters. For example, VUTS might make a sound like an electrical current. Do whatever is most memorable to you.Another way is to fill in the gaps with individual words. While WVUT can relate to West Virginia, Utah, RQP can relate to running to the queue and taking your place.

, Combine all mnemonics together. The more you are able to link the letters into vivid images, the more easily you’ll recall them. For instance, if you remember MLKJIHG as Martin Luther King doing a jig, you’ll instantly recall those six letters instead of trying to recall them one at a time.

, Many people use the alphabet song to remember the alphabet forwards. You can do this to learn the alphabet backwards. Speak the letters or the words. Use the tones of the letters or words to create your song.


Even if you only recite the letters with a simple but consistent melody, this strengthens your memory., Once you’ve found a way to combine all the letters of the alphabet into a story, practice with it. It can take some editing and rehearsal to make the story feel memorable. Recall each part of the story one word at a time. When a significant word comes up, pull out the next letters in the alphabet.

Play scissors or rock in the first round.,
Switch moves if you lose.,
Look for tells.,
Announce your throw.,
Watch for your opponent’s frustration.,
Go for paper to win by statistics.","How to Win at Rock, Paper, Scissors2"," Experienced players won’t throw a rock for their first move, so you should lead with scissors. This way you can beat their paper or tie if they also lead with scissors., If your opponent won a round, they’re likely to use that same move again in the next round. Knowing this, you should change your move that you lost with to one that can beat the move that your opponent had just played.

For example, if your opponent just beat you with a rock, you should switch your next move to paper to beat the rock that your opponent will likely use again., Opponents often have tells in the way they position their hands that will let you know what move they might be thinking about.


For example, a tucked thumb in the crook of the index finger suggests that your opponent will throw rock.A loose hand is usually going to result in paper.
A hand that has the first two fingers loose is likely going to be scissors., Tell your opponent that you’re going to use a rock move. Telling your opponent your next move will have them thinking that you won’t actually throw that move. Then when you do actually throw that move, you’ll have a greater chance of beating them since they weren’t expecting it.

For example, tell your opponent you’re going to throw a rock. Since your opponent thinks you won’t actually lead with a rock, they’ll assume you’re going to play paper or scissors. Your opponent will then likely play scissors or rock to beat your paper or scissors. Then when you play rock, you either beat their scissors or draw a stalemate to their rock. In either case, you don’t lose!, If your opponent is repeatedly losing they’re more likely to throw rock, since this is symbolically a very aggressive option that players rely on when losing.

On the other hand, paper is seen as the most passive move so you won’t expect this from an opponent who’s losing., When you’re at a loss of what to do, throw paper. Because scissors is the statistically least often thrown move, and because rock is the most often thrown move, paper is the best way to go.Paper will beat rock, which is the most commonly thrown move. Scissors can beat paper, but because it’s the least often thrown move the chances of losing are much less likely.

You’ll need to find a partner to play with before you begin., Decide on the amount of odd numbered rounds you want to play for the game. This way, you’ll know going in how many rounds you need to win., Pound your fist on your other open hand three times before shooting your signal. This is usually denoted by saying “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” You pound your fist on your open hand for the “rock, paper, scissors” and throw your move on “shoot.”, Understand the three moves of the game: rock, paper, and scissors. Rock is formed by making a fist with your thumb tucked in your index finger. Paper is formed by opening your hand out flat with your palm facing down. Scissors is formed by extending only your forefinger and middle finger in the shape of a “v” with your other fingers curled into your palm., Rock wins against scissors, paper wins against rock, and scissors wins against paper.

If the same move is thrown by both players, it results in a stalemate., In case of you and your partner throwing the same move, play the round again until someone wins."

, Put one letter in each box. You can write them backward, forward, diagonally, and vertically. Try to evenly distribute the words throughout the grid. Get creative with your placements. Make sure to write all of the words that you have listed next to the grid so that they are actually in the puzzle. It would be very confusing to be looking for a word in the word search that isn’t actually there.


Depending on who you are giving the puzzle to, you may wish to make your letters larger or smaller. If you want your puzzle to be a little less challenging, like if you are giving it to a child, you might consider writing your letters larger. If you want your puzzle to be more challenging, make your letters smaller.

, Once you have finished writing in all the words, make a photocopy of it and highlight all of the hidden words. This will serve as your answer key so whoever does your puzzle will be able to see if they got everything right (or can get help if they are stuck on one word) without the confusion of the extra, random letters.

, Once you have written all of your chosen words into the puzzle, fill the still empty squares with random letters. Doing this distracts the person from finding the words in the search.


Make sure that you do not accidentally make other words out of your extra letters, especially other words that fit into your theme. This will be very confusing for the person doing the puzzle.

, Only do this if you are planning on giving your word search to more than one person.

Play your first X in a corner.,
Try to win if your opponent plays the first O in the center.,
Win automatically if your opponent plays his first O in any square besides the center.,
Place your third X so you have two possible winning moves.,
Win with your fourth X.",How to Win at Tic Tac Toe1," Most experienced tic tac toe players put the first ""X"" in a corner when they get to play first. This gives the opponent the most opportunities to make a mistake. If your opponent responds by putting an O anywhere besides the center, you can guarantee a win.In this example, you are going first, and using X as your symbol. Your opponent goes second, and uses O.





;
, If your opponent plays her first O in the center, you have to wait for her to make a mistake before you can win. If she continues to play correctly, she can guarantee a tie. Here are your two options for your second move, followed by instructions on how to win if she makes certain moves (if she doesn't, just keep blocking her plays and the game will be a tie):


Place your second X in the opposite corner from your first, so there's a line going ""X O X"" diagonally across the board. If she responds with an O in one of the other corners, you can win!Place your third X in the last empty corner, and your opponent won't be able to block you from winning with your fourth X.







Or, place your second X on an edge square (not a corner), not touching your first X. If your opponent puts down an O in the corner that's not next to your X, you can use your third X to block her move and automatically win with your fourth X.







, If your opponent puts his first O in any square besides the center, you can win. Respond by putting your second X in any other corner, with an empty space in between the two X's.


For example, say your first X is in the top left square, and your opponent puts an O in the top middle square. You can put your second X in the bottom left corner, or the bottom right corner. Don't put it in the top right, since that would put an O between your two X's instead of an empty space.







, Most of the time, your opponent will see that you have two X's in a row and block you. (If not, just win by making a row of three X's.) After this happens, there should be an empty square that is in line with both your first and your second X, with no enemy O's blocking that line. Put your third X in this square.


For example, take a piece of paper and draw a tic tac toe board with the top row ""X O _"", the middle row ""O _ _,"" and the bottom row ""X _ _."" If you place your third X in the bottom right corner, it's in line with both of your other X's.

, After your third X, there are two empty squares that will win you the game if an X goes into one of them. Since your opponent can only make one move, he can only block one of those squares. Write your fourth X into the square he didn't block, and you've won the game!

Force a draw if the opponent starts in the corner.,
Force a draw when the opponent starts in the center.,
Try to win if the opponent starts at the edge.",How to Win at Tic Tac Toe2," If the opponent plays first and starts with an O in a corner, always put your first X in the center. Your second X should be placed on an edge, not a corner, unless you need to block your opponent from getting three in a row. Using this strategy, every game should be a draw.Theoretically, you can win from this position, but your opponent would have to make a huge mistake, such as not seeing that you have two X's in a row.


In this section, your opponent is still playing O's, but remember she gets to play first this time.

, When your opponent starts by putting down an O in the center, place your first X in a corner. After that, just keep blocking your opponent from scoring and the game will be a draw.There is essentially no way for you to win from this position, unless your opponent stops trying to win or stop you from winning!

, Most of the time, your opponent will start with one of the moves above. However, if your opponent puts down the first O on an edge, not on a corner or center, you have a small chance to win. Put your first X in the center. If your opponent puts the second O on the opposite edge, making a row or column that reads O-X-O, put your second X in a corner. Then, if your opponent puts the third O in the edge that is adjacent to your X, making a line that reads O-X-O, put your third X in the empty square to block their row of two O's. From here, you can always win with your fourth X.If at any point, your opponent doesn't make the exact move described above, you'll have to settle for a draw. Just start blocking their moves and neither of you will win.

Try these out if your tic tac toe games always end in draws.,
Play mental tic tac toe.,
Play 3D tic tac toe.,
Play five in a row.",How to Win at Tic Tac Toe3," It might be fun for a while to be unbeatable at tic tac toe, but even without this article your friends might figure out how to stop you from winning. Once that happens, every single game of tic tac toe you play with them will be a draw — ugh. But you can still use basic tic tac toe rules to play games that aren't as easily solved. Try them out below.

, The rules are exactly the same as tic tac toe, but there's no board! Instead, each player says her moves aloud, and pictures the board in her head. You can still use all the strategy advice in this article, but it can be difficult to concentrate on that when you're trying to remember where the X's and O's are.


Agree on a system for describing moves. For instance the first word is the row (top, middle, or bottom) and the second word is the column (left, middle, or right).







, Draw three tic tac toe boards on separate pieces of paper. Label one board ""top,"" another ""middle,"" and the third board ""bottom."" You can play anywhere on these boards, and they work as though they were stacked on top of each other to make a cube.For instance, taking the center on all three boards wins you the game, since it makes a line standing vertical through the cube. Getting three in a row on any single board also wins. See if you can figure out how to win with a diagonal line across all three boards.


For a real challenge, combine this with the last variation and try mental 3D tic tac toe. The first word is the board (top, middle, or bottom), the second word is the row (top, middle, or bottom), and the third word is the column (left, middle, or right).







, Play this game, sometimes called Gomoku, on a piece of graph paper, without even having to draw a board. Instead of marking X's and O's inside the squares, write them at the intersections where the graph paper lines meet. You can make each move anywhere on the graph paper. The first player to get exactly five in a row (not six or more) wins the game.This game is surprisingly complicated, despite its similarity to tic tac toe, and even has world championship tournaments.In tournaments, players use a 15x15 or a 19x19 board, but you can use any size of graph paper for this game. You could even play on an infinite board, taping on more graph paper whenever you need to.

The remaining cells can be solved by considering the number of buildings visible from the bottom.

",How to Solve a Skyscrapers Puzzle," In some cases, these will be equal and the entire grid will be filled with skyscrapers. In others, there may be some empty spaces or parks. Subtract the length of the rows from the number of heights to find the number of parks in each row. In this example, it is stated that there are four buildings heights. In the 5x5 grid, that means one park in each row and column.;
, The tallest building will block everything else in that row or column and therefore cannot be placed next to any digit other than 1. If there are multiple 1's in a row, all but one of them must be a park. Since this example has four heights in a 5x5 grid, each row and column contains only one park. Use the + symbol to indicate cells where the height is still unknown, but cannot be a park. Identifying the locations of the parks is a significant step towards the solution.

, When a building of maximum height is found, there must be at least as many other buildings between it and each edge as the number of buildings visible from that edge.

, If the number of visible buildings equals the total number of building heights, they must be in increasing height. If the location of all park squares in that row or column are also known, then that row can be fully solved.

, For example, the second row could be either 4123 or 4132, but only 4132 has three buildings visible from the right. Therefore the right edge must be height 2, since you already know it can't be empty.

, In the example, since the maximum height is 4, a three can only be placed on an edge where the number of visible buildings is 2 (only itself and a 4 at some further locations can be seen). Along the top and right, there is only one possibility.

, With the 3 and 4 placed, the top row must be 3421 to have three buildings visible from the right and the first column must be 3412 to have two buildings visible from below. Consider marking rows and columns whose constraints have been fully met. These won't always be completely solved––the location of the 3 in the second row is not yet known, but in either available location, the left side will see only 4, while the right side will see 234, so those numbers will provide no more information.

, In this example, four of the five height 2 buildings have been found, so there is only one place for the last one.

, In the example, the fourth row can only have two buildings visible form the left, not the required 3, if the first cell is empty. Therefore the park squares of both the third and fourth rows can be determined.

To solve any puzzle which gives you containers of different sizes, and asks you to measure out a seeming impossible quantity of water, you start by filling the smaller container and emptying it into the larger one.


You are standing next to a flowing water fountain and have two containers, one holds 5 gallons (18.9 L), the other, 3 gallons (11.4 L). You must measure exactly 4 gallons (15.1 L). How do you do it?

The doctor was the boy's Mother.
He was eating duck (or, ostrich, or any other kind) eggs.
Since you are the bus driver, they are the colour of your own eyes.
Solid, gaseous, and liquid (the three states of matter).
You can't take a photograph with a wooden leg. You need to use a camera.
The truck used up more than 2 pounds of petrol before getting to the bridge, and thus weighed less than when it left London.
The score before the game is always 0 - 0.
Take the chicken across. Return and get either of the others (say, the feed). Take it across. Return with the chicken and leave him on shore as you pick up the fox. The rest you can figure out.
The tractor was driven over in winter, when the water surrounding the island was frozen solid.
Fill up the 3 and empty into the 5. Fill the 3 again and put as much as you can (2) into the 5. Empty the 5 and pour the 1 gallon (3.8 L) left in the 3 into it. The rest is simple.;

Realize that the quiz-setters won't ask questions that are completely impossible.,
Look for the clues within the question itself.,
Use your general knowledge.,
Guess the answer from the topic.,
Note the styles of questions that appear on different quiz shows.,
If you're serious about quizzes, learn the lists of data that are likely to recur in shows: names of planets and their moons, US presidents and their dates in office, states and their capitals, etc.

,
Challenge yourself!",How to Guess the Answers in Trivia Questions," That knowledge enables you to vastly reduce the range of potential answers.


For instance, this question from Trivial Pursuit: Which English king built Whitehall Palace? You may think this question is impossible unless you already know the answer, but actually the answer can be guessed fairly easily. You can reason that the answer is probably going to be a king who is at least moderately well-known - after all, they are not going to ask the question if the answer is Offa of Mercia, as that would be too hard. So, how many English kings can you name? If you're like most people, you're probably limited to Henry 8th, Richard the Lionheart, King John, and Alfred the Great. You probably know from the Robin Hood films that Richard the Lionheart and King John didn't build ""palaces"" - in those days it was more about castles than palaces. Alfred the Great was even earlier, so he is an even less likely contender. Anyway, ""Whitehall Palace"" sounds fairly recent, not an ancient Anglo-Saxon name. That leaves you with just one possible answer - Henry 8th. Which is correct.;
, Questions often contain lots of clues. Here's an example, from the quiz show Fifteen to One: For what do Australians fondly remember Andrew Barton Paterson? Again, you probably know the answer without realizing it. Look carefully at the question and see what it tells you.


Firstly, there are two clues that the answer is something that exists only in the past, namely the word ""remember"" and the fact that nowadays most people do not go by three-word names.
Secondly, the word ""fondly"" tells us that the answer probably has some sort of sentimental content.
Thirdly, the use of the word ""Australians"" means that the answer is something that is of relevance to all Australians, not just some of them, and therefore is probably something to do with national symbolism. It must also be something that a person can create, not something natural such as a national animal or flower.
Moreover, as per the previous hint we can be fairly sure the answer must be something we have actually heard of.
We have now narrowed the range of possibilities right down to the point where there is really only one possible answer, namely that Andrew Barton Paterson wrote Waltzing Matilda. Which is correct.

, If the quiz you're doing is a more difficult one, you can often still work out the answers but you'll need a wider range of general knowledge in order to help you. Here's an example from University Challenge, a difficult British TV quiz for the brightest university students: Which is the fifth largest city in Ireland, located by the confluence of three rivers?


Since you know the quiz is a very difficult one, the answer is definitely not going to be something obvious like Dublin or Cork, but again it cannot be something completely impossible. However, there is a deliberate clue in the question, namely the rivers, which are a gentle nudge that the answer is Waterford. Obviously if you have never heard of Waterford you cannot guess this answer, so some general knowledge is required, but the important thing is to look for and notice clues in the questions.
Here's another example, from the same quiz show: Which French city's bridge was originally built in 1185 and destroyed in 1668? You may think the question absolutely impossible - surely France is full of bridges, and how can you be expected to know the dates they were all built?! In fact though it's possible to guess the correct answer just from the first four words, ""Which French city's bridge..."". Here's the reasoning: think about French cities and bridges. How many French bridges would even a well-educated non-Frenchman have heard of? Very few indeed - probably only one: the bridge in Avignon, which you may know from the children's song Sur Le Pont d'Avignon - On the Bridge at Avignon.

One of the contestants on University Challenge did indeed give the correct answer, apparently by guesswork. In fact, he used all the reasoning in this article to correctly guess this question and many others. Viewers were amazed by his apparently encyclopedic knowledge, but in fact all he was doing was reasoning his way to the correct answers.



, Using this technique, you can sometimes work out the answer to a question after only one or two words, or even before the questioner has begun to ask it. It sounds impossible, and people seeing you do it may be completely amazed, but it's simpler than it sounds. In order for it to work, you have to know the topic of the question before it's asked, which in some quizzes is pre-announced. The logic of this technique is this: for most topics there is usually a very limited number of questions that can be asked. Therefore, as soon as you know the subject of the question you can probably guess the answer. Here's an example, from the trivia show The Weakest Link, and although the full question was given on the show, I will give only the first two words: ""The Lorelei..."".


It is in fact extremely easy to guess the answer: the river Rhine. As soon as you hear that the topic of the question is the Lorelei, you can guess that the question will be ""The Lorelei lured sailors to their deaths on which river?"" Of course it's possible to think of other questions, but they are all much less likely. The easier the show, the smaller the potential number of questions. Try this yourself: think of some topics and then think how few questions can realistically be asked about them. With many topics, there is only one fact about them that is generally known, so there is only one question that can be asked. For example, if the topic is the Eiffel Tower, the answer is probably Paris. If the topic is Joseph Heller, the answer is probably Catch 22. And so on.

, Question-setters have favorite styles which you can recognize and learn. They also have favorite topics, which you can swot up on.

,, As you watch more quiz shows and learn the techniques, you should be able after a few words to guess the full question, and work out the correct answer, AND predict the most likely wrong answer that the contestant on the show will give!

Calculate the magic constant.You can find this number by using a simple math formula, where n = the number of rows or columns in your magic square.,
Place the number 1 in the center box on the top row.,
Fill in the remaining numbers using an up-one, right-one pattern.",How to Solve a Magic Square1," So, for example, in a 3x3 magic square, n = 3. The magic constant = n. So, in the example of the 3x3 square:


sum = 3 * sum = 3 * (10 / 2)
sum = 3 * (5)
sum = 15
The magic constant for a 3x3 square is 15.
All rows, columns, and diagonals must add up to this number.;
, This is always where you begin when your magic square has odd-numbered sides, regardless of how large or small that number is. So, if you have a 3x3 square, place the number 1 in Box 2; in a 15x15 square, place the number 1 in Box 8.

, You will always fill in the numbers sequentially (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) by moving up one row, then one column to the right. You’ll notice immediately that in order to place the number 2, you’ll move above the top row, off the magic square. That’s okay — although you always work in this up-one, right-one manner, there are three exceptions that also have patterned, predictable rules:


If the movement takes you to a “box” above the magic square’s top row, remain in that box’s column, but place the number in the bottom row of that column.
If the movement takes you to a “box” to the right of the magic square’s right column, remain in that box’s row, but place the number in the furthest left column of that row.
If the movement takes you to a box that is already occupied, go back to the last box that has been filled in, and place the next number directly below it.

Design a Polybius square (see image).,
Write the message you want to encipher.,
Replace the first letter of your message with the numbers that correspond to its coordinates.,
Repeat the previous step for all the letters in your message.,
Decode the message by replacing each pair of coordinates with its corresponding letter.,
Finished.

",How to Use a Polybius Square,"


Create an equal number of numbered rows and columns (see image). To determine how many rows and columns to make, find the square number (also called a perfect square) that is nearest to the number of letters in your alphabet. Then take the square root of that square number--this will be the number of rows and columns in your Polybius square. For example, in the English alphabet, there are 26 Write Different letters. The closest square number to 26 is 25, and the square root of 25 is 5, so you would need 5 columns and 5 rows, as shown in the image. Other languages use alphabets with more or fewer letters, so depending on the language used, the Polybius square may have more or fewer than 5 rows and columns.
Write the letters of the alphabet in your grid. There should be one letter at the intersection of each row and column. In the simplest form, you can just write the alphabet out in order, but if you want to make the code harder to crack, you can mix up the letters. If there are too many letters in the alphabet to fit into the square, you can omit one or two (preferably these are uncommonly used letters). In the example, the letter ""J"" has been omitted. If there are too few letters to fill the grid, you can leave some spaces blank or use them for punctuation, emoticons, or whatever you like.;
, Let's take a simple example: ""I love wikiHow,"" though there's obviously no reason to hide the fact that you love wikiHow.

, Look at your Polybius square, and find the row and column numbers of your first letter. In the example ""I love wikiHow,"" the letter ""I"" is the first letter. ""I"" is located at the intersection of row 2 and column 4, so you would begin your coded message with the number 24 (the row number is usually written before the column number).

, ""I love wikiHow"" becomes ""24 31 34 51 15 52 24 25 24 23 34 52."" You could also get rid of the spaces (243134511552242524233452) or leave spaces only between words (24 31345115 52242524233452).

, If you're sending the message to someone, you'll need to also send them the Polybius square. Send it to them separately to heighten the security of your message.

Look for any of these local conditions and draw the appropriate inferences:


A black circle on the edge or one square away from the edge must extend toward the center.,
Reapply the above conditions again and after any significant progress.,
Look at the endpoints of each segment of the path.,
A white circle two cells away from a black circle can impose a restriction since it the path extends from the black circle to the white circle it is forced to immediately turn.,
Look for any region that is almost closed off from the rest of the puzzle.,
Continue to look for obstructions similar to those above created by the new parts of the path drawn.,
As most of the solution gets filled in, switch from thinking locally to thinking globally.",How to Solve a Masyu Puzzle,"
Two adjacent black circles must move away from each other.
A white circle on the outer border must go parallel to the border. If two white circles on the border are adjacent or have only one space between them, both must turn inward after they connect.
Three or more consecutive white circles force the path to pass through them separately as shown. The path cannot pass straight through all of them without violating the turn constraint of the middle one.
A black circle diagonally adjacent to two white circles in the same row or column must move away from them. More generally, the path through a black circle cannot make a corner around any white circle.;
, Each additional segment of the path that is known adds more boundary to the unsolved portion. The new segments created an edge near a white circle and a black circle restricting the way the path must pass through those cells.

, Consider which direction it could take next, straight, left turn, or right turn. If only one continuation exists, take it. Avoid all of the following situations:


Intersecting another part of the path. Do not create any 3 or 4-way junctions.
Forming a closed loop that is smaller than the complete solution. There must be only one loop.
Creating a closed off region that contains an odd number of endpoints. This will create a string, but there will be no way to connect the loose ends to close the loop.
Violating a turn constraint.

, If this is not possible, then the path from the black circle must extend in the opposite direction.

, Any isolated region must contain an even number of endpoints.

, For example, if any part of the loop passes parallel to and adjacent a white circle, then you must pass through the white circle in the same direction to avoid creating a 3-way junction.

, Getting a good start requires local observations like those described in step one. Finishing the puzzle requires focus on avoiding small loops and dead ends.

Understand what a singly even square is.,
Calculate the magic constant.,
Divide the magic square into four quadrants of equal size.,
Assign each quadrant a number range.,
Solve each quadrant using the methodology for odd-numbered magic squares.,
Create Highlights A and D.If you tried to add up your columns, rows, and diagonals right now, you’d notice that they don’t yet add up to your magic constant.,
Swap Highlights A and D. This is a one-to-one swap; simply lift and replace the boxes between Quadrant A and Quadrant D without changing their order at all.,
Do an additional swap for singly even magic squares larger than 6x6.",How to Solve a Magic Square2," Everyone knows that an even number is divisible by 2, but in magic squares, there are different methodologies for solving singly and doubly even squares.


A singly even square has a number of boxes per side that is divisible by 2, but not 4.The smallest possible singly even magic square is 6x6, since 2x2 magic squares can’t be made.

, Use the same method as you would with odd magic squares: the magic constant = / 2, where n = the number of boxes per side. So, in the example of a 6x6 square:


sum = / 2
sum = / 2
sum = (6 * 37) / 2
sum = 222 / 2
The magic constant for a 6x6 square is 222/2, or 111.
All rows, columns, and diagonals must add up to this number.

, Label them A (top left), C (top right), D (bottom left) and B (bottom right). To figure out how large each square should be, simply divide the number of boxes in each row or column by half.


So, for a 6x6 square, each quadrant would be 3x3 boxes.

, Quadrant A gets for the quarter of numbers; Quadrant B the second quarter; Quadrant C the third quarter, and Quadrant D the final quarter of the total number range for the 6x6 magic square.


In the example of a 6x6 square, Quadrant A would be solved with the numbers from 1-9; Quadrant B with 10-18; Quadrant C with 19-27; and Quadrant D with 28-36.

, Quadrant A will be simple to fill out, as it starts with the number 1, as magic squares usually do. Quadrants B-D, however, will start with strange numbers — 10, 19, and 28, respectively, in our example.


Treat the first number of each quadrant as though it is the number one. Place it in the center box on the top row of each quadrant.
Treat each quadrant like its own magic square. Even if a box is available in an adjacent quadrant, ignore it and jump to the “exception” rule that fits your situation.

, You have to swap some boxes between the top left and bottom left quadrants to finish your magic square. We’ll call those swapped areas Highlight A and Highlight D.


Using a pencil, mark all the squares in the top row until you read the median box position of Quadrant A. So, in a 6x6 square, you would only mark Box 1 (which would have the number 8 in it), but in a 10x10 square, you would mark Boxes 1 and 2 (which would have the numbers 17 and 24 in them, respectively).
Mark out a square using the boxes you just marked as the top row. If you only marked one box, your square is just that one box. We’ll call this area Highlight A-1.
So, in a 10x10 magic square, Highlight A-1 would consist of Boxes 1 and 2 in Rows 1 and 2, creating a 2x2 square in the top left of the quadrant.
In the row directly below Highlight A-1, skip the number in the first column, then mark as many boxes across as you marked in Highlight A-1. We’ll call this middle row Highlight A-2.
Highlight A-3 is a box identical to A-1, but placed in the bottom left corner of the quadrant.
Highlight A-1, A-2, and A-3 together comprise Highlight A.
Repeat this process in Quadrant D, creating an identical highlighted area called Highlight D.

, Once you’ve done this, all the rows, columns, and diagonals in your magic square should add up to the magic constant you calculated.

, In addition to the swap for quadrants A & D mentioned above, you also need to do a swap for quadrants C & B. Highlight columns from the right side of the square toward the left one less than the number of columns highlighted for highlight A-1. Swap the values in quadrant C with the values in quadrant B for those columns, using the same one-to-one method.

Here are two images of a 14x14 Magic Square before and after doing both swaps. Quadrant A swap area is highlighted blue, Quadrant D swap area is highlighted green, Quadrant C swap area is highlighted yellow, and Quadrant B swap area is highlighted orange.

Understand what a doubly even square is.,
Calculate the magic constant.,
Create Highlights A-D.,
Create the Central Highlight.,
Fill in the magic square, but only in Highlighted areas.,
Fill in the rest of the magic square by counting backwards.",How to Solve a Magic Square3," A singly even square has a number of boxes per side that’s divisible by 2. A doubly even square has a number of boxes per side divisible by double that — 4.The smallest doubly-even box that can be made is a 4x4 square.

, Use the same method as you would with odd-numbered or singly-even magic squares: the magic constant = / 2, where n = the number of boxes per side. So, in the example of a 4x4 square:


sum = / 2
sum = / 2
sum = (4 * 17) / 2
sum = 68 / 2
The magic constant for a 4x4 square is 68/2, or 34.
All rows, columns, and diagonals must add up to this number.

, In each corner of the magic square, mark a mini-square with sides a length of n/4, where n = the length of a side of the whole magic square.Label them Highlights A, B, C, and D in a counter-clockwise manner.


In a 4x4 square, you would simply mark the four corner boxes.
In an 8x8 square, each Highlight would be a 2x2 area in the corners.
In a 12x12 square, each Highlight would be a 3x3 area in the corners, and so on.

, Mark all the boxes in the center of the magic square in a square area of length n/2, where n = the length of a side of the whole magic square. The Central Highlight should not overlap with Highlights A-D at all, but touch each of them at the corners.


In a 4x4 square, the Central Highlight would be a 2x2 area in the center.
In an 8x8 square, the Central Highlight would be a 4x4 area in the center, and so on.

, Begin filling in the numbers of your magic square from left to right, but only write in the number if the box falls into a Highlight. So, in a 4x4 box, you would fill in the following boxes:


1 in the top-left box and 4 in the top-right box
6 and 7 in the center boxes in Row 2
10 and 11 in the center boxes in Row 3
13 in the bottom-left box and 16 in the bottom-right box.

, The is essentially the inverse of the previous step. Begin again with the top left box, but this time, skip all boxes that fall in Highlighted area, and fill in non-higlighted boxes by counting backwards. Begin with the largest number in your number range. So, in a 4x4 magic square, you would fill in the following:


15 and 14 in the center boxes in Row 1
12 in the left-most box and 9 in the right-most box in Row 2
8 in the left-most box and 5 in the right-most box in Row 3
3 and 2 in the center boxes in Row 4
At this point, all your columns, rows, and diagonals should up to your magic constant you calculated.

Look for any total charge counts that are equal to or one less than the length of that row or column.,

Look for a row or column that has an unbalanced charge and combine this with the fact that each whole domino is neutral.,

If any row or column has its full number of charged poles, mark the remaining cells in that row or column as neutral.,

Note the number of neutral cells needed in each row and column.,

Fill in the orientation of the magnets that share an edge with another magnet of known orientation.
,

Now that additional charged and neutral dominoes have been identified, revisit the earlier steps and check the row and column sums again.
,
Look for any row or column that has only one domino perpendicular to it whose charge isn't accounted for.,

Continue looking at the total and net charges for additional places to apply these ideas.,

Look for almost completed rows or columns where the charge of each pole has been identified.,

Look for dominoes that lie adjacent to charged dominoes in a way that forces them to be neutral.,

Finishing this example puzzle only requires repeating types of logical deduction already applied.",How to Solve a Magnets Puzzle," All dominoes with both ends in that row or column must be magnets. We can't determine the polarity yet. In these diagrams, an open circle represents a magnet that is not neutral, but whose polarity is unknown.
, This net charge must come from those dominoes that are oriented perpendicular to that row or column. This method also works for groups of rows. In the example, the bottom two rows have a net charge of -2 and there are two vertical dominoes connecting this region to the top 6 rows. Both of those then must be charged and must have the positive pole on the top., Also mark the other end of any neutral domino as neutral., If all of them have already been identified, mark all remaining cells in that row or column as charged. If all but one have been identified, mark all dominoes parallel to the row or column as charged. No magnetic monopoles allowed! If one end of a magnet is charged, then the other end is as well. Label these accordingly.,,, Its status can be found by observing the parity of the total number of charged cells in that row or column. Since the fifth row has a total charge of 3, it the charges must be in one vertical and one horizontal domino. The remaining vertical domino must be neutral. Since the charge is unbalanced, the polarity of some other magnets can also be determined., As parts of the puzzle become solved, other deductions work. For example, the left three columns have a net charge of +1. Initially there were two horizontal dominoes that could contain the positive charge, but now one of them is adjacent to another positive charge., Try to deduce the charge of the remaining dominoes., If both ends of a domino are adjacent to the same charge, or if one side is adjacent to both charges, then it must be neutral., In this case, the left side now solves easily, while the right side requires observing that whichever of the upper two dominoes is charged forces it's column to have 3 negative and 2 positive charges."

Create the draw piles.,
Begin playing Anomia.,
Take turns in clockwise-order, drawing cards one-at-a-time and adding them to your play pile.,
Face offs (aka what to do when the symbols match).,
Cascades (what to do if the loser's pile reveals a new top card).,
Wild cards.,
Ending the game.",How to Play Anomia,"
Duration: 30 minutes;
, Once you are seated in a circle, take one of the decks from the Anomia box and shuffle it 5-6 times. Divide the deck into two draw piles so players can easily reach them.

There are two different versions of Anomia, the regular edition with 2 decks (red and blue) and the party version with six decks (brown, pink, orange, purple, green and yellow). While game play is the same, each deck is a bit different.
Each Anomia deck is made up of 92 different cards (sharing 8 symbols) plus 8 wild cards.

, According to the game instructions, the person who shuffles the cards should go first. When it's your turn, draw a card from one of the draw piles, then quickly flip it face-up so that everyone sees it at the same time. Put the card face-up in front of you -- this is the beginning of your play pile.,

Each card has one of 8 symbols. Continue drawing cards until the symbols match.

, If the symbol on your card matches that of another player, you have entered what's known in Anomia-speak as a ""face-off round"" -- this is the core of the game.

In order to win the face-off round, provide a correct example of the person, place or thing on your opponent's card.
If you finish blurting out a correct answer first, you win the card.
If you win, you take the other player's card and put it face-down into your winning pile (not to be confused with your play pile of face-up cards). Do not move or block the view of your top card.

, Once a new top card is revealed, check to see if the loser's card matches that of another player. If so, immediately enter into face-off mode. Do not draw cards until all possible face-offs have been played.

After all the face-offs and cascades are over, resume normal game play.

, A card with two symbols is a wild card and should be placed face-up between the two draw piles. If the two wild card symbols appear on cards topping any two player's play piles, then it's time to go into another face-off round.

Once a wild card is in play, you must look for both cards matching you own card or matches that match the wild card.

, Anomia is over when all the draw piles are empty. Count the cards in your winning pile. Whoever has the most cards wins. You can resume playing Anomia either with your current deck or you can try another deck to change things up."

Shuffling the cards is optional, but preferred because it gives the impression of a real game. In reality, it does not matter if the cards are mixed up.
Try not to laugh because the players may become suspicious.

, After you have shuffled the cards, ask the following question: “Are you ready to play 52 Card Pickup?”

, Wait for a response and after one or all players say they are ready, bend the deck slightly and release your hold on the outside edges of the cards as if shuffling one-handed so that the spring tension sprays the cards all over the floor. Then say: “It's 52 card pickup!”


Another opportunity to play 52 Card Pickup is when you are playing absolutely any other card game and you find yourself losing. You can stop the game and say “52 card pickup” just before releasing all of the cards onto the floor.

Gather all the participants in the game.,
Set up the game.,
Decide who's going to be pouring the alcohol and refilling the empty glasses.,
There is an option of having a sober person nearby.,
Have someone to keep track of how many shots each person has drank.,
Choose the beginner.,
Have that person to make his or her statement.,
If no one drinks a glass, meaning they've never done it, then the person who made the statement has to drink a glass themselves.,
Whoever is the most sober by the end of it wins.","How to Play ""Never Have I Ever"""," Typically, you'd need at least five people to join in, but there can be as many as you want, provided you have enough alcohol.;
, This means getting out the glasses and the alcohol and gathering chairs around a table. The table is preferably circular. You'll need to get at least an equivalent number of shot glasses for each player.

, This will keep the game flowing. One of the players can pour the drinks, but the drunker they get, the more difficulty they might find in doing so.

, This isn't actually necessary, but it's recommended as a cautionary addition. This person can be a good friend who isn't really into drinking or simply isn't in the mood to play, and they can sit nearby just to make sure someone doesn't get dangerously drunk or accidentally hurt themselves. They can also be the designated driver, or be the one to call up a cab for the players to drive home in. In addition, this person can be the one to pour the alcohol also.

, This is best left in the hands of the sober friend, because this may be a factor into who wins the game.

, This is when you choose who's going to go first.

, The statement has to be something that person has never attempted or done before. For instance, ""Never have I ever been to a brothel."" Anyone who has been to a brothel has to drink a shot of alcohol.

, This is meant to encourage strategy. If you don't think anyone's done it, don't say it.

, The game can go on as long as everyone's able and interested, but when it finally ends, there are two ways of determining the winner. The winner is either the one who drank the least shots, or the one who acts the most sober, though the former is more accurate.

You can also issue a challenge to find a particular card where the first person to find that card is the winner.

Add a hanging ribbon.,
Add the final row of fringe around the top edge of the piñata.",How to Make a Mini Piñata1," Instead of whacking your piñata with a stick, you will pull on a tab attached to the bottom. This will break the tissue paper and release the candy.
, Cut a piece of ribbon, preferably balloon or curling ribbon. Tape one end of the ribbon to the center of one square. Leave the other square alone for right now.

For a neater finish, cut a slit into the center of the square, then slide the end of the ribbon into the slit and tape it down.

, Place the square over one end of an empty toilet paper roll. Make sure that the ribbon is sticking out. Tape each of the square's corners onto the roll., Stack three colors of tissue paper together. Cut a few 2-inch (5-centimeter) wide strips out of the stack. The strip needs to run the entire length of the tissue paper. You will be trimming it down further later on.You can also use crepe paper or crepe paper streamers instead.

, Fold the strips in half several times. Cut narrow, evenly-spaced slits into one edge. Unfold and separate the strips to reveal your fringe.

Take into consideration the gaming console the guests play at home.",How to Pick Party Games for a Gaming Console2,"  PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, DS; the list never ends! While choosing a console, though, keep in mind who's coming to the party. If everyone has Xbox 360s and they love Xbox games, Playstation games wouldn't be the best option. Another thing to remember is that you don't have to pick just one!


All games have a specific format of console they'll work. Look for the logo of the console on the game disk or package. Playstation games can be tricky as some PS3 (slim) models only play PS3 disks. Other models (fat) will easily be able to read and display PS3 as well as PS2 and PS1. Many identical games can be disk formatted for different systems as are many sporting games. Sort this out before the party.
Also check the accessories of your particular console. Make sure your disk are unscratched, not smudged, and clean. Make sure your controllers, step pads are working and free of missing buttons. Make sure the microphones work for games that are voice activated. Make sure your memory is adequate for playing games as well cleaning out junk game files.
New gaming systems are no longer using or requiring the purchase of that specific console's memory card. The same memory cards used for digital cameras (SD) use or USB aka flash or pen drives are being used instead.
Although vintage games aren't true party games you can have a Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Atari party and have your guest (if they are able) bring old games from that particular system.

, Everybody has their own favorites but if your are unsure of the preferences you might want to consider a more general or classic game that satisfies the majority of the people.


The Mario Party series is a 4 (or sometimes 8) player game that practically is a board game which each player fills spaces of his/her color by playing mini games which can be racing or fighting. The player can also go against the computer as well. Mario Party like all Mario Games only plays on Nintendo brand consoles like WII, GameCube. Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a game where the Characters of Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario Bros. Games compete against each other in an Olympic like sports events.
Hasbro Family Game Night is a series of games that is available for Playstation and Xbox which has practically Hasbro brand board games such as Battleship, Bop It, Sorry!, Scrabble with or without added features. Sorry! game has sliders. Yahtzee Bowling is Yahtzee with bowling. Another one called Family Fun Pack has favorites such as Monopoly, Scrabble and Trivia.

Trivial Pursuit is one of the majority of Trivia games that work like Jeopardy the game asks a question and the players must respond with the correct answer. You Don't Know Jack is another trivial games that throws questions in several modes or what is gibberish (a phrase or word scrabbled up).
Any of the sports games like NBA 2K Series are really party games in their own right because 4 or more players can play on a team or on two separate teams. The same goes for fighting/battle games such as Tekken Tag Tournament, and Killer Instinct. With some the hits are shown as blood and gore and others are marked by fireworks and sparks.
Just Dance on Wii is a great example of one of many dance party party. Instead of the traditional hand control the player holds a motion sensing device as tries to follow moves the dancer on the game display. Many singing or rapping party games use a microphone instead o the motion sensor thing. Guitar Hero and others like have a instrument accessory that simulates playing the actual instruments.
Hunting and adventure party simulate being in a 3D battlefield like going into a haunted house, walking in corn maze or playing a paintball, lazer tag game. Call of Duty, Final Fantasy XIII, Zelda, Twisted Metal are examples. Pick the more fiery or sparky ones for sensitive people who don't like gore and blood.
Many favorite series, licensed characters and children's favorites also come in party games. Shrek: Treasure Hunt, Shrek Super Party, Disney Channel All Star Party, chances are your favorite show will soon become in some way made into a party game.

, It's your party and you can play whatever you want however it's in good manner to consider the age and ability of the guest to the party. Some games are made for preschoolers who are learning ABC's and 123's which would bore teenagers and adults. ""Halo"" games are too advanced for youngsters and are a hit with teens.


Don't be afraid to eliminate or limit the amount of gore and blood when necessary in fighting games and war games. A fighting game that shoots sparks instead of blood and guts is a good substitute for a sensitive person or at a family gaming party.
Read the age ratings to make sure you don't play a explicit game (nudity,swearing,violence) at a child's birthday party.
Have a spare even broken control around for a little toddler or youngster. Many little ones get a kick out of just holding the control and ""playing along"". It's really amusing and picture worthy when you see little sibling having the time of his life.
If your throwing like a wedding party or someone else's birthday party. Be careful not to let the game become the sole purpose of the party! This can be very rude and disrespectful for the host of or guest being at the party. Pick something like singing, trivia or dancing to be sure this doesn't happen.

Consider adding additional shapes with cut construction paper or cardstock.",How to Make a Mini Piñata2," The design should be roughly the size of your hand.

Poster board works well for this. You can also use cardstock or a cereal box.

, Use the design to trace another identical design on another thin sheet of cardboard. Cut that design out as well.You can cut it out with a pair of scissors, or you can use a craft blade for more precision., The strip needs to be about 1½ inches (3.8 centimeters) wide, and long enough to wrap around the perimeter of your design. If you need to, cut several strips, and tape them together.If your design has an inner shape, such as a doughnut, be sure to cut a strip out for that as well.

, Place several strips of tape around the edges of your first shape, as close together as you can. Flip the shape over so that the sticky side of the tape is facing up. Wrap the thin cardboard strip around the edges of your shape. Secure it with the tabs of tape that are sticking out.If you wish to fill your piñata with candy, leave a 1 to 2-inch (2.5 to 5-centimeter) gap in the bottom of the piñata.

Wrap the fringe around the piñata, pressing the top/smooth part of the fringe into the glue.If you don't plan on breaking your piñata apart, you can use double-sided tape instead.

, Apply your next line of glue just above the first fringe. Press the second strip of fringe into the glue, so that the tassel part covers the smooth part., Depending on the shape you created, your piñata may still have bare patches on the top and bottom walls. Cover these patches with 1½-inch (3.8-centimeter) wide strips of tissue paper. Do not add fringes to these., You do not have to do this, but you can make your piñata look more interesting by gluing cut paper on top of the fringe.

If you’re choosing the pairs who will race together, keep in mind that some children may naturally be more athletic than others. It may be smart to match a more athletic child with a less athletic counterpart, so that different teams can be competitive with one another.

, Have the teams line up evenly in front of the starting line. The first child in each pair should lay down on the ground with their arms bent and hands next to their chest, as if they’re about to perform a push up. Have the second child grab the first child’s legs and lift up, as the first child pushes their torso up off the ground.The wheelbarrow race derives its name from this pose, as the child whose hands are on the ground and feet are in the air looks something like a wheelbarrow.

, Once all of the pairs are in position, shout “On your mark, get set, go!” and let the competitors begin racing. The first child will set each pair’s pace; they have to “run” by placing one hand in front of the other, while the second child holds up the first child’s legs and runs to keep up.If necessary, remind the second child in each pair (the one standing) not to rush their teammate, or else the “wheelbarrow” racer may fall and slow the pair down.

, The individual who has served as the “wheelbarrow” will stand up, while their partner assumes a push-up position. The standing individual should grab the ankles of their partner, effectively reversing the positions for the race back to the finish line.From here, the participants simply need to race back to the finish line.

, Keep track of the pairs as they cross the line, and announce the first-place winners as they arrive. If you like, you can also announce the second- and third-place teams. Allow the rest of the teams to finish the race at their own pace, and congratulate all of the wheelbarrow-race participants after all teams have crossed the finish line.


If you’re overseeing this race at a run outdoor setting like a summer camp or a field day, it would be appropriate to reward the winning team with a small treat, like a soda or ice cream bar.

, In this version of the wheelbarrow race, adult competitors will still race in pairs of two, but one will sit in a physical wheelbarrow while the other pushes. Competitors should bring their own wheelbarrow.


For the sake of convenience and courtesy, have a toolbox on hand in case one or more of the wheelbarrows malfunction. Make sure your toolbox contains wrenches in both regular and metric sizes and a variety of screwdrivers.

, If you’re organizing the wheelbarrow race, be aware that races of this sort are often performed as a “Fun run” (something like a 5k, although much shorter) or to benefit a charity via fundraiser. Other wheelbarrow races function like bar or pub crawls, with participants racing from one bar to the next (you’ll likely need permission from your city to hold an event like this).Theming the race is optional; you can forego a theme if you’d prefer the competitors to focus on the race itself.


Depending on the reasons for holding the wheelbarrow race, you (or the event organizers) can ask participants to dress up or decorate their wheelbarrows with fun costumes or paint.

, Unlike the children’s version of this game, most adult wheelbarrow races do not have a turn-around point. In order to make the race challenging, the course should be fairly long; start out by establishing a quarter-mile (400 meters) track. If this doesn’t seem like an adequate distance for the competitors to race, lengthen the track to a half mile (800 meters).


If you would like to mark the half-way point of the race track, you could ask participants to switch positions at that point. The seated individual could hop out and replace their partner pushing the wheelbarrow.

, Monitor the finish line and note the first, second, and third place teams. Depending on the purpose of the race, you could either give the winning teams a small cash prize (e.g. $20 for first place, $10 for second place, and $5 for third place), or donate a corresponding amount of money to a charitable organization.

Gather overly large articles of clothing for your game.,
Organize your race as you would normally.,
Distribute the clothing between teams.,
Start the relay.,
Rotate through players until one team finishes.",How to Have a Crab Race2," These articles might include things like hats, scarves, overlarge shirts, pants, sunglasses, and so on. Each team should have a complete set of clothing.


For example, if you have two teams you might collect two shirts, scarves, and hats for your race.
Many suitable articles of clothing like this can be purchased inexpensively from secondhand or thrift stores, like Salvation Army and Goodwill., Just like in a traditional crab race, you'll need to mark the start and finish and divide teams. If you have uneven teams, the team with one less player should choose one member to run the race twice.

, Each team should get one set of clothing apiece. Lay out these articles on the start line with a few feet (1 to 1.5 m) of distance between each team's collection of clothing articles.

, After you signal the start of the race (""Ready, set, go!""), players will put on the articles of clothing and race from the start to the finish and back again. When they return, they must take off the clothing and the next player must put it on before running the crab race.To make this game more challenging for older kids, you might add rules like, ""You have to button all the buttons on the shirt at the start and unbutton them at the finish.""

, Players should run the race one person at a time per team until all members have run the race. The first team to have all teammates complete the crab race clothing relay is the winner.

Add obstacles to your racetrack.,
Have a crab race on an inflatable course.,
Perform activities during the crab race.",How to Have a Crab Race3," There are many different kinds of obstacles you can use to make your racetrack more challenging. For example, you could set up cones between the start and finish lines and have players weave back and forth between these.


Team members not currently running the race can hold a hula hoop roughly a foot (.3 m) off the ground and have racing teammates clamber through this obstacle.
Set out used tires in the same fashion as is frequently done for American football footwork drills. Have players race over this obstacle., If you have an inflatable obstacle course available to you, or if you intend on renting one as part of a camp or community activity, crab race on the inflatable course. You may only want to attempt this with older kids; younger children may struggle too much with this.


An inflatable course can be rented from local inflatable rental companies. To find a store near you, do a keyword search online for ""inflatable obstacle course rental near me.""
An inflatable course, or several smaller inflatable surfaces that can be put together to form a makeshift obstacle course, can be most easily purchased online.

, Although the crab-walk motion is already relatively awkward, you can make it more challenging by adding a task to it. For example, you might have crab racers:


Dribble a soccer ball while crab racing.
Carry an object on their stomach while they race.
Crab race to from start to finish, then bear walk (where you're on all fours with your stomach facing down) from the finish back to the start.

Deal out an entire deck of cards.,

Continue playing until someone runs out of cards.,
Hold on to your sevens, sixes, and eights as long as possible.,
Use poker chips to raise the stakes.,
Allow people to play more than one card.,
Keep track of how many cards you have left for scoring.,
Use the Ace as the lowest card instead of a two.",How to Play the Card Game Called Sevens," Pick one person to be the dealer and have them hand out a deck of 52 playing cards, face-down and one at a time, to each person going clockwise. This game can be played with anywhere from three to eight people.Depending on the amount of players, the cards may be dealt unequally.
To solve this, switch dealers each round so that everyone has a round with the lowest or highest amount of cards. As long as the dealer switches clockwise and each dealer hands out cards going clockwise, the pattern will repeat fairly.;
, To help keep yourself focused, organize the hand dealt to you. You want to arrange the cards first by suit, and then in numerical order. It’s best to start with any twos on the far left and run them up to the ace on the far right.


A whole run will look like this: 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A.The four suits are hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs. Alternating the colors of the suits in your hand will also make it easier to find cards to play.

, Whoever has the seven of diamonds lays it down on the table. When a seven of any suit is played it starts a ""layout."" A layout is made by laying cards down one by one next to the seven in sequential order.


You will have four layouts total, one for each suit.
As the game continues, the only way a suit layout can be started on the table is if someone plays a seven.
Some variations of this game select the person to the left of the dealer to go first, regardless of who has the seven of diamonds.

, Layouts go horizontally on the table. You can create a grid of 4x13 cards if you put each suit going sideways above one another. Or instead, you can start stacking the rest of the sequence of a suit on top of the 6 and 8 cards to save space.


If you lay the cards vertically within their suits, the game will resemble the solitaire setup.

, Each person puts down one card on their turn, but it has to be the next card in relation to the ones already on the table. For example, the next cards played after a seven will either be the six or the eight in that suit.


Going in order from the seven means you will play cards that descend to the two card of that suit on the left-hand side of the seven and on the right-hand side, the card values will ascend to the ace.For example, if you have a jack of hearts, you can’t play that card until someone has played the ten of hearts on the table.
You can only put cards of the same suit together. If a seven of hearts is on the table, you can only play a six of hearts next to it, not a six of spades., Knocking the table is one way to say that you are passing on your turn. Or instead, you can just say “pass.” You may pass when you don’t have any cards that are playable. For instance, if there are only fives through nines on the table and all you have left are twos and face cards.It is against the rules to pass on a turn if you have a card that can be played anywhere on the table.
If playing with poker chips, one penalty you can use is that if someone passes when they had cards to play, they have to put three chips in the pot.

, Go around the table, each putting one card down, until someone plays their last card. They are the winner of that round, and if you’re only playing one round then they are the winner of the game. Collect all 52 of the cards and start a new round or game.


You can play several rounds within one game to play longer or just play a quick game while killing time.
You have several options for choosing the next dealer. One option is that the person to the left of the original dealer is now the new dealer.
The other option is to have the winner deal the cards, or the person to the left of them. All that matters is that each person gets a chance to deal the cards.

, If you decide not to play these cards, it will keep other players from being able to get rid of their own cards. No one can play their low or high cards out of sequence so you have the power to stall the game and increase your chances of winning.Of course, if these numbers are your only playable cards, you can’t pass but have to play them.

, When the game starts, each player puts a chip into the pot. The people with the least amount of cards in their hand put an extra chip in the pot to even the playing field.Every time someone passes, they have to add a chip to the pot. The winner of the round or game gets the whole pot.


Use tokens, pennies, or even candy instead of chips.
You can attribute money to the chips for real gambling or not, if you choose.

, To speed up the game, scrap the rule that says you can only lay down one card at a time. For example, if you have a four, three, and two of spades, you would be allowed to lay down all three as a run.


This variation only applies to one suit at a time. You can’t lay down an eight of hearts, nine of hearts, and ten of diamonds.
Even if you have numerical ordering, the cards have to be in the same suit to lay them down as a run in one turn.

, After someone gets rid of their cards, use a piece of paper or notebook to log how many cards each player has left. Each card equals 1 point. Start a new round, and keep track at the end of each. Once someone reaches 100 points, the game is then over and the winner is whoever has the smallest score.For shorter games, only go to 50 or 25 points, depending on how much time you have.

, Some people order the cards starting with the ace, and going up from the two to the king as the highest card. This will only slightly change the order of the layout. On the left side of the two you will lay cards out to the two instead of the ace and on the right side the run will end at the king."

Pick your opponent.,
Count your articles of clothing.,
Shuffle the deck and deal each person 26 cards.,
Determine the hierarchy of all the cards.,
Flip over the top card in your stack as your opponent does the same.,
Remove an article of clothing when you lose a hand.,
Play until someone has removed all of their clothing.",How to Play Strip War1," This is a raunchy game, so you’ll want to play with someone you’re comfortable with! War is typically played with just two people, but feel free to play with more.While regular War isn't much of a party game, Strip war is an excellent one!


War also pairs nicely with your significant other and a bottle of wine. Consider making your next date night a game night.;
, Make sure you and your opponent are wearing the same number of items so you have the same amount of pieces to lose. It’s also important to determine which pieces of clothing are fair game. For example, it’s a pretty uneven (and boring) game if one person is removing socks and jewelry while the other is taking off their shirt and pants!


Figure out what people realistically will and will not take off. If not everyone feels comfortable removing everything, indicate that now.

, Keep the cards facing down so neither you nor your opponent knows which cards you have.Arrange your cards into a neat stack in front of you.


The cards that you're flipping over should be a surprise to both you and your opponent. It makes the game much more exciting when neither of you know what to expect.

, The numerical cards are self-explanatory. The royal cards rank King, Queen, and then Jack from highest to lowest. The card typically in question is the ace. Decide with your opponent if it should be the very lowest card (1) or the highest card, above the King., Whoever has the highest card of the two takes both cards and places them in a separate stack next to them. Continue doing this as you go through your entire stack of cards.Once you run out of cards in your deck, pick up the stack of cards you’ve won and continue with that deck. This continues until someone has won the entire deck.

, In other words, you strip when you've completely run out of clothing to remove. It's up to you and your opponent to decide which articles of clothing are removed, and in what order. You can plan the order in which articles of clothing are removed, i.e. shirt, then pants, then undergarments. If you’re feeling trusting, you can let the winner choose what article of clothing the loser has to remove.

, Because only one article of clothing is removed per hand, this method of Strip War requires lots of time. It is guaranteed to be raunchy, however, because you play until someone is completely naked!

(Not all cards can be Tech Masters.

Set up as if you were playing a normal game of war.,
Go to “war” if you and your opponent play cards of the same rank.,
Remove an article of clothing if you lose a War tiebreaker.You and your opponent can either plan which articles of clothing are removed in which order, or you can let the winner of the tiebreaker decide which article of clothing the loser must remove.,
Play until someone has won all of the cards in the deck.",How to Play Strip War2," Shuffle the deck and deal each person 26 cards. Count your articles of clothing to ensure that you and your opponent are wearing the same number of items. With your stack of cards face down, begin playing by flipping a card. Whoever has the higher card takes both.

, Anytime you put down equal cards, e.g. if you both put down Queens or both put down sevens, you have to play War to break the tie. You and your opponent both put down the next card in your stack face down, and the following card face up. Whoever has the higher face-up card takes all six cards that are now on the table.If the face-up cards are the same, play War again until someone has a higher card.

, If the first tiebreaker face-up cards match and there has to be a second tiebreaker, the loser has to remove two articles of clothing. The same goes for three consecutive tiebreakers, and so on.

, This goal of this version of Strip War is the same as regular War, and it takes less time than the first method of Strip War because only one game is played. Because you do not know how many tiebreakers you may have in a game, you may end up stripping off multiple articles of clothing or none at all. This may be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on how you look at it.

Commence dealing.,
Before the game begins, players can take cards out of their army (hand), and place these in their fort.,
The player to the left of the dealer starts first and there are many moves available to them.,
Build Watchtowers.,
Consider challenges.,
Beware of the assassins: 7's are used as normal as fort cards but are special assassins in the army.,
Complete the watchtower: If you get 4 cards to put in a watchtower of the same number by winning the last card off another player you now have a solid watchtower and no longer need a fort.,
Get ready for a showdown: This takes place when everyone in the game is on a campaign.","How to Play the Card Challenge ""Watchtower"""," Each player is dealt 4 cards face up - this is their ""fort"" and their stronghold. They are then dealt 4 cards face down that they can pick up and have in their hand this is their ""army"". The remaining pack is placed face down on the table. This is the ""barracks"".;
, If there are cards of the same value in your fort, they should be placed on top of each other, forming a ""watchtower"" (so that other players can easily see how many of them there are). Players can ""burn"" a card once before the start of the game, provided nobody else has more than one of these in their fort. Burning means placing a card on the bottom of the barracks, and picking a fresh one up off the top. If you burn a royal card or an ace, you may pick up two cards.

, The first thing they do is pick up a card from the reserve pile or ""barracks"". The player can put as many cards as they want into their fort from the army keep them in their army where no one knows what the card is. Players can also burn a card in their fort once per turn. A player can put a card they picked up straight into the fort and then burn it straight away, but previous rules still apply.

, If the player has more than one card of the same number they can place these cards on top of each other to build 'watchtowers'.

, Before a player ends their turn, they can challenge another player for a card in their fort. The attacker then selects whether it is a 1 or 2 card challenge (although this is limited by the number of cards the opponent has in their army). The attacker holds their army out to the defender so that the defender cannot see the values of the cards, and the defender selects 1, 2 or 3 cards (depending on whether it is a 1 or 2 card challenge) and places these face down on the table. The defender then does the same for the attacker, who selects an equal number of cards and places them face down next to the defenders chosen cards. The cards are then turned over. For each pair of attacking and defending card, the highest card wins (aces are high). If the attacker wins both - attacker wins, If the defender wins both the defender wins, If the cards are both equal or they win one each it is a draw, if one card is a draw and the other is a win then the player who wins - wins the battle. Whoever wins the battle gets to keep the ""soldiers"" and they are placed into the winner’s army, if it is a draw however, the cards go back to their respective owners' armies. If the attacker wins the fort card from the defender also goes into his army, but if it is a draw or the defender wins the card stays in the defender's fort. If the attacker wins the challenge or ""battle"" they can then do anything they want with the cards they have won - burn them, put them in the fort or keep them in the army. (Remember though that you can only burn one card a go).


You can only challenge for the same card 3 times. If you lose on the third time, the card is taken from the defender's fort and put at the bottom of the barracks and the defender is given a new fort card from the top of the barracks. You can challenge for a watchtower card but you need 6 cards in your army to challenge for the card on top of a double watchtower or 10 cards for the top of a triple watchtower. If a royal or ace card is used in a battle, regardless of whether they win or lose, they have to go back into the barracks after the battle. When challenging, if you end up with no army cards left your fort is vulnerable and anyone challenging for your fort cards can just take the one they want, however the must have 6 army cards for a double or 10 for a triple watchtower. Similarly, if you just have army cards, you have nowhere to base your army and so if you loose a battle you automatically lose the game (this shouldn't happen though as you can put as many fort cards down a go as you want).

, If a 7 is drawn in a challenge the number of the card it is fighting has no bearing on whether it wins or looses. If it is the attackers 7, then it beats any card, but if the 7 belongs to the defender any card beats a 7.

, However, if you get the card to complete your watchtower by picking it from a barracks, a ""free-for-all"" takes place. The person behind you in the turn of play chooses a face down card from your pile, and you chose a card from the person behind you e.t.c until all the players have a card out, face down in front of them. The cards are then turned over and the person with the highest card takes back their card and the card being battled for, the other players retain their cards. If you then have a watchtower, you pick up all the fort cards and put them in your army and you are now on a ""campaign"". On a campaign, you do not pick up at the beginning of your go, nor can you be challenged for your watchtower cards. You must gain cards by taking them from other people's forts, but you could still lose all your army cards. On a campaign, royal and ace cards have no limit and can be used over and over but you must still challenge as before and must have the appropriate number of cards to challenge for a double or triple watchtower. If you lose all your army cards you have lost your campaign and so you lose your watchtower. 2 of your 4 watchtower cards are returned to the barracks, 1 remains as a fort card and 1 becomes an army card. 2 more cards are then drawn from the barracks to make 3 fort cards then 2 cards are drawn from the barracks to make 3 army cards and the game carries on as normal. Remember that a watchtower cannot be challenged but if two people are on campaigns, when other people in the game are still playing as normal, they can have a battle. In this case a three-card challenge takes place, and the winner keeps all the cards from the battle. Though, if all the players in the game have a watchtower a showdown takes place.

, The player with the lowest number of army cards places shuffles their deck and places their cards face down in a line, if the number of cards is an even number the card placed down last is removed to the barracks. The player or players that have more cards then shuffle their decks and remove from the top a number of cards so that they have the same amount as the first person. They then place their cards in a line next to the first person's cards so that each card is paired with another card (or if it is a three or four way showdown other cards). The cards are then turned over to reveal a winner (where the highest number wins, if the numbers are equal it is a draw) of each pair or set of cards and the winner keeps those cards as a ""trick"". The winner of the showdown and therefore the game is the player with the most tricks at the end of the showdown. If, due to the numbers being the same it is a draw, there is a battle of the watchtowers. In this, the player(s) draw a number of cards from the barracks equal to the number of the card number of their watchtower (e.g. if their watchtower is 4 8's then 8 cards - all royals and aces are 10). The person with the lowest cards then shuffles and lines the cards face down as before and the person with more cards shuffles and removes as before so the players have the same amount of cards and another showdown takes place. Again, if the watchtower number is an even number, a card is removed. This time if the final result is a draw the cards are reshuffled and the same cards played against each other again. This continues until a winner emerges.

Deal 1 card to the middle-left pile. This is one of the active piles during game play.
Deal 1 card to the middle-right pile. This is one of the active piles during game play.
Deal 5 cards to the far right pile. This is one of the reserve piles for game play., Have each player deal 5 cards off of their pile of 20 cards. The new pile of 5 cards becomes the hand that is played from; the remaining 15 become a draw pile for that player.









Keep the 5 cards of your playing hand face-down until game play begins.
For the rest of the game, you should always have 5 cards—and only 5 cards—in your playing hand by drawing from your draw pile., Have your opponent flip over one of the two middle piles of 1 card in the center of the table, while you flip over the other one.









Count down from 3 at the same time as your opponent so that you flip over the cards at the same time.

, Survey your 5 cards to determine if any can be played on either of the active middle cards that you just flipped over. Play a card if it is in sequential order from one of the middle cards, in either ascending or descending order, regardless of suit.








For example, if one of the middle cards is a 5, you can play a 4 or a 6 from your hand on top of it.
The order of cards is 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A. The order continues in a circuit, so if there is an Ace on a middle pile, you can play a King or a 2 from your hand on top of the pile.
Don’t let your opponent see the cards in your hand.

, Keep laying down cards from your hand in ascending or descending order from the top cards on either of the middle piles. You and your opponent lay down cards as quickly as possible.









There are no turns, so both players continue to lay down cards as fast as they can. You can play as many cards in a row as you want without waiting for the other player to lay down anything.
Draw a card from your draw pile of 15 cards every time you lay down a card from your hand, so that you have 5 cards in your playing hand at all times. After you run out of cards in your draw pile, continue to play out all 5 cards in your playing hand to win.

, If neither player can lay down a card from their hand on either of the top cards in the middle, flip over a card from the far left or right 5-card reserve piles at the same time as your opponent. Place these cards on top of the piles in the middle and resume play from your hand.








Repeat this process any time game play halts due to neither player being able to lay down a card.
If you run out of your left and right reserve piles, turn over the middle piles, shuffle them, and flip over the top card from each of them to resume play.

, Be the first to get rid of all of your cards, slam your hands down on the middle piles, and yell “Speed!” to be the winner of the game.









Typically, Speed is played as a best-out-of-three game. The first player to win two games wins the set. But you can play for as many games as you like!

, Try modifying game play to allow players to play the same number card on one of the middle piles, in addition to playing ascending or descending cards.


For example, you could play a 5 on another 5 card, or a 4 or 6 as in normal game play.
Play this variation if you want to make the game easier or go by faster.

, Modify the game by agreeing with your opponent to be able to lay down more than one card at a time in ascending or descending order.


For example, if you have a 3, 4, and 5 in your hand, you can wait until you see a 2 or a 6 on a middle pile and then lay down all three cards at once onto the pile.
Play with this variation if you want to make the game go by faster or just want an extra way to “attack” or best your opponent by getting rid of cards more quickly.

, Try including the two Joker cards into your deck before dealing. If you get a Joker in your playing hand, use it on top of any card in the middle pile to act as a “wild.” Play any other card in your hand on top of the wild Joker, and play resumes normally on that card.


Try to hold onto a Joker in your hand as long as possible, only using it when you can’t play any of the other cards in your hand. A Joker must be played, however, when you can’t play any other cards and before you and your opponent can flip over reserve cards onto the middle piles.
When you use Jokers in the deck, player draw piles should have 16 instead of 15 cards each.
The Joker cannot be the last card you play to win the game.

, Expand the game to include more than two players by creating an extra middle pile for each player. In this case, deal out cards to the middle piles first, then distribute playing cards evenly to each player. Everyone should still have 5 cards in their playing hand.


For three players, have three active middle piles for the players to lay cards on. For four players, have four active piles.
Try using two decks instead of one when you're playing with more than two players for a longer game with more possibilities for game play.

Mark the start and finish of your race.,
Separate players into teams.,
Ready the starting line.,
Start the game.,
Rotate through players.,
Congratulate the winning team.",How to Have a Beanbag Race1," This distance can be as long or as short as you desire. Generally, mark a start and end point 20 ft (6 m) away from each other. You might want to decrease this distance for especially young kids, or increase it for adults.You can use a line of tape on floor, cones, or a personal item, like a shoe, to mark your boundaries.;
, An even number of players works best for this style of beanbag race. If that's impossible, the team with less players should choose one player to run twice. Split all those who want to play into two teams., Have both teams line up at one of your marked off lines. This will be your starting line. Place two beanbags, one for each team, on the starting line. Allow a few feet (1 to 1.5 m) of space between beanbags.Smaller sized beanbags are preferred for this race, especially for younger children, as these will be easier to scoop up and hold with the chin.

, When the game starts, one player from each team should pick up one beanbag from the starting line with their chin. They must carry the beanbag with their chin from the start line to the finish line and back again without dropping it.You may want to count down to the start or use your phone to make a starting noise, like a siren, bell, or whistle.
At no point during the beanbag race are players allowed to touch the beanbag with their hands.
Players who drop the beanbag should return to the start line, return the beanbag to the ground, scoop it up in their chin, and try again.

, When players return to the starting line, they should drop the beanbag as close to the starting line as possible. The next player then must pick up the beanbag with their chin and repeat the process until all players have run.

, The first team to rotate through all their players and cross back to the starting line wins. If you'd like to play again, you might want to shuffle players between teams."

Keep playing until one players goes through all his or her cards.",How to Play Super Speed," In order to play the game, make sure you use a standard 52 card deck. Make sure to count the deck ahead of time to make sure no cards are missing. You'll need all 52 to properly divide the deck for a game of speed.;
, You and your partner will each have a stock pile of cards you draw from throughout the game. You should count out 20 cards for yourself, and 20 cards for your partner. When you need new cards during the game, you'll draw from your stockpile.Some variations of speed may use 15 card stockpiles instead of 20 card stockpiles.It does not make a huge difference in the game, but if you find you and your partner go through cards fast, a bigger stockpile may make more sense.

, The ""spit cards"" are two cards set out in the middle of the table. These are the cards you'll be playing off of when the game begins. As you learn more about how the game works, this will make more sense. Before the game starts, the spit cards should be face down at the center of the table. Take 2 cards and place them face down side-by-side at the center of the table where you're playing speed., At certain points in the game, you will have to draw new spit cards. You will need reserve piles from which to draw the new cards. On either side of each spit card, set down 5 cards face down. These are your reserve piles.If you're using 15 cards in your stockpiles instead of 20, your reserve piles would consist of 10 cards each.As stated, the number of cards in your stock and reserve piles does not make a huge difference to game play.

, You and your partner should always have at least 5 cards in your hand. Before the game begins, you should each draw 5 cards from your separate stockpiles. Do not let your partner see your cards.It's a good idea to take a moment to familiarize yourself with your cards. You and your partner may want to take a minute or so to look through and organize your cards.

, In speed, you focus on the number on a card. Suit is not important for speed. You have to play your cards in ascending or descending order, so it's important to know the proper numerical order of cards. When playing speed, the order of cards is as follows: aces, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, sevens, eights, nines, tens, jacks, queens, kings.It's a good idea to organize your deck in ascending or descending order, as this will come in handy when the game begins. For example, say you have a jack, a queen, a two, an eight, and a seven. From left to right, order your cards like this: two, seven, eight, jack, queen.
This may sound confusing, but the rules will become clearer as we go over a typical game of speed.

, To start the game, flip over the two spit cards in the center. You will be playing off of these cards as the game starts. Once you flip over the card, you and your partner simply play cards as fast you can, striving to get rid of your hand. You do not take turns, so be prepared to start playing once you flip the spit cards.

, Now, you can begin to play. The object of speed is to get rid of all your cards, including your stockpile, before your opponent. You play by placing cards from your hand on top of the spit card in the center. You can only play the next highest or next lowest card on top of the spit card.This can be confusing when speaking in the abstract, so let's return to our example. You have a two, seven, eight, jack, and queen in your hand. You flip over the spit cards. One spit card is a six and the other is a queen.
You can get rid of three cards in your deck quickly. You can place your seven over the six, and then your eight over the seven. On the six spit card, you are working in ascending order. You can work in descending order on the other spit card, by placing your jack over the queen.
However, you do not take turns in speed. If you don't play your cards fast enough, you can miss your chance to win. Your partner could very well block your play by working faster than you. For example, while you're placing your seven and eight cards down, your opponent may place his own jack over the queen.

, You always have to have 5 cards on hand when playing speed. For each card you set down over the two spit piles in the center, draw a new card from your stockpile., In most games of speed, you'll eventually run into a scenario where you and your partner have run out of plays. This means you and your partner both have 5 cards in your hands, but no cards can be played in the spit pile. In this case, you'll draw two new cards from the reserve pile to serve as the new spit cards.Remember, the reserve piles are the 5 cards stacked face down next to the spit cards in the center. Draw two new cards from the reserve piles and place them on top of each spit pile. You can now resume playing.
In the event you and your partner still have no plays after drawing new spit cards, you'll have to draw new spit cards again.

, You may eventually run through the spit card reserve pile. In this case, you would take the two spit piles in the center of the table. Turn the piles upside down and draw two new cards from the top of each pile., You win speed by being the first player to go through your stockpile. Keep playing speed until you're completely out of cards. The first player to finish off his or her cards wins.The best strategy to win a game of speed is to think fast. You want to make sure you play any eligible card you have before your partner tops the spit pile.
Try to play a few practice rounds of the game first. Just play through one hand of five cards and go slowly, allowing you and your partner to figure out the rules of the game. Speed often sounds complicated at first. It's not a bad idea to practice before attempting an actual game.

"
"
Figure out what the winning score should be to end the game.,
Know that four players usually play Spades.,
Shuffle and deal the cards, distributing them evenly amongst the players until all 52 have been given out.,
Pick up your cards, concealing them from their opponents.,
Begin bidding.,
Use nil bids and blind nil bids, if agreed upon.,
Follow the suit of the card placed down first.,
Understand that the card with the highest face-value wins the trick, provided it's in the same suit as the lead card.,
If a player cannot follow in the same suit as the lead card, either discard or trump.,
Do not lead with a trump (any spade card), unless trump has already been broken.,
In a four-player game, continue all gameplay until 13 tricks have been played.,
After all tricks have been played, teams or players tally up their tricks.,
Compare the number of tricks won to the number of tricks bid at the beginning of the game.,
If your tricks won exceed the number of tricks bid, give yourself one ""sandbag"" or ""overtrick"" point for each extra trick won.,
After making sure the points have been recorded, have the dealer collect all the cards and shuffle to begin a new hand.",How to Play Spades," This is usually a multiple of 100 (most often 500), but players can determine it to be lower or higher depending on how long they want the game to last.








, You can have more or fewer, but tournament Spades is usually played in groups of four. If playing in teams, players should sit across from each other. This works best at a square table with a player on each side.









, Though not required, Spades etiquette is that all players refrain from picking their cards up before all the cards are dealt out.









If the number of players is not a factor of 52, simply deal until everyone has the same maximum number of cards and discard the remainder.

, If players wish to arrange their cards in order of suit or rank, they should take this opportunity to do so. Keep in mind that arranging your cards too hastily can reveal information about your hand to the other players that you don't want them to know, so be discreet!









, Bidding consists of a player looking at their cards and determining how many tricks they think they can win. For example, if you bid two tricks, you're betting that you'll win at least two tricks. If your game of Spades involves partners, you and your partner's bids are combined into a contract. If you bid two tricks and your partner bids three, the two of you have to win a total of five tricks to complete your contract.









The first player to bid is typically the one to the left of the dealer, proceeding in a clockwise direction.
Make sure to write down the bids so you don't forget who bid what as the game goes on.
Every player must bid at least one trick; you cannot pass unless you are playing the nil bids variant of the game (see below).

, In customary Spades games, each player has to bid that they'll take at least one trick. One variant of this is to allow nil bids or blind nil bids. Agree upon this variation before bidding begins.









A nil bid is bidding that you won't take any tricks. A player might get a bonus of 100 points, for example, if they bid nil and don't take any tricks, and a penalty of -100 if they do take at least one trick.
A blind nil bid is when you bet that you won't take any tricks before looking at your cards. In some variations, a player bidding blind nil may exchange two cards from his or her hand with a partner.In some variations, a player may only bid blind nil if they are behind by at least 100 points.

Blind nil bids that are successfully met get 200 points; blind nil bids that are overdrawn get -200 points.




, Going in a clockwise direction, the first player puts down a card from their hand. This card cannot be a spade, since this is the trump suit for all other cards. Players put down cards one after the other, following the suit of the first card.









For example, if Player 1 leads with the 7 of Clubs, each other player, if possible, must put down a club this round. Although the other players cannot see your cards, it is impossible — and bad etiquette — to lie about which suits you have, as players will keep track if you fail to put down the lead suit.


, In Spades, cards are valued according to face-value: Ace is the highest and 2 is the lowest card value. For each trick, the player who lays down the highest card value takes all the cards, sets them face down next to their area, and records one trick.









Therefore, in a trick which contains the 3 of spades (lead card), 8 of spades, 10 of spades, and K of spades, the player who put down the K wins the trick.
In a trick which contains the 5 of hearts (lead card), the 2 of hearts, the 6 of hearts, and the 4 of hearts, the player who put down the 6 wins the trick.


, If a trick is lead with a 4 of diamonds, and the next player in line does not have a single diamond card, s/he has the option of either discarding from a non-trump suit (a club or heart, in this case), or trumping with a spade. If a spade is played, the highest spade wins the trick.









In a trick which contains the 6 of hearts (lead card), 7 of hearts, Q of clubs, and K of diamonds, the player who put down the 7 of hearts wins the trick.
In a trick which contains the J of clubs (lead card), 2 of spades, 6 of clubs, and 3 of spades, the player who put down the 3 of spades wins the trick.


, Common rules dictate that players can lead with any suit except for spades, as these are trump cards. This rule is set is place in order to prevent a player with a glut of trumps to use them, one after the other, early on, thereby depleting other players' trumps.








, At this point, all cards should be absent and tricks should be divided among the players.









, Count the total number of tricks you won. (Each trick should be a set of four cards, so divide your total cards by four to get the total number of tricks.)








, If you bet five tricks, and you won at least five tricks, multiply the number of contracts by 10 to get your score. (Four bid tricks and four won tricks gives you a point total of 40.) If you bid five tricks, for example, but only collected four tricks, multiply the number of tricks bid by 10, but turn that into a negative number. (Four bid tricks but only three tricks won gives you -40 points.)








, If, for example, you bid three tricks and win four, you receive 30 points for meeting your bid, but an extra point for exceeding it. You'll therefore have 31 points.









Once you have a total of 10 sandbag points, you're penalized 100 points. This total runs throughout the game, so be careful about winning extra tricks!

, Play continues in this fashion until one person/team reaches the score set at the beginning of the game.

Take out the Joker and shuffle the cards.,
The first player should take the first card on his/her pile and place it on the middle.,
If the card was a Jack, the player should slap the Jack.,
The game goes on and on until the player who got all of the cards wins!

",How to Play Slap Jack," Give all the cards to the player. The cards should be downside, and nobody can peek the cards.;
, If the card is not a Jack, the next player would do the same thing.

, The first one who hit takes the Jack and all the cards underneath.(If there is no cards underneath, then just take the Jack)

Mark your start and finish line.,
Divide players into teams.,
Cue the start of the race.,
Have players ferry beanbags as they race.,
Track players to find the team that wins.",How to Have a Beanbag Race2," The distance between your start and finish can be adjusted to suit the ages of those playing. For younger kids, you may want this to only be 10 ft (3 m). For adults, you might lengthen this to 30 ft (9.1 m).There are many items you can use to mark your starting and finish line. Common markers include tape, cones, unused balls, rocks, or personal items, like shoes.

, An even number of teams works best for this activity. If you have uneven teams, after dividing players, have the team with one less player choose one player to go twice., Once the cue is given, players should race toward the finish line and back to the starting line. You might say something like, ""Ready, set, go!"" or use a noise from your cell phone, like a siren, a bell, or a whistle., Each player must, one at a time, carry a beanbag from the start to the finish and back again. They may only touch the beanbag once when placing it at the start line. They should place the beanbag and ferry it by either:


Balancing the beanbag on their backs.
Squeezing the beanbag between their knees., When a beanbag falls on the ground, the player who dropped it must start from the beginning. The first team that has all players complete the race is the winner."
"
Split players and line them up in rows.,
Supply the players at the head of the row with beanbags.,
Signal the start of the game.,
Pass the beanbag down the row to the end and back again.,
Shuffle players and play again.",How to Have a Beanbag Race3," This version of beanbag race also works best with an even number of players. Once the players are separated into two teams, line players up into two rows, one row per team.In the event you have an uneven number of players, the team with one less player should choose one player to go twice. This player will start at the head of the row.

, Each team should receive one beanbag apiece. Any size beanbag should work fine, though you may want larger beanbags for smaller children, as these will be easier to handle., This can be done easily by yelling something like, ""On your marks... get set... go!"" You could also use your phone to play a game starting sound effect, like a siren, a bell, or a whistle., For very young children, simply passing the beanbag may be enough of a challenge. For older children/adults, have players pass the beanbag in a certain style, like with only their left hand, over their left shoulder, under their right leg, and so on. For uneven teams:Have the player at the head of the row for the team with one less player pass the beanbag then run to the end of the row.
When the player passes the beanbag for the second time, sending it back toward the head of the row, have them run to their starting position.
When the beanbag and the player going twice both reach the head of the row, the race is complete.

, If you only want to play once, you're finished. If the same teams want a rematch, simply restart game. Otherwise, shuffle players between teams and play again in the fashion described.


To keep things interesting, you may want to change the style in which the beanbags are passed or make it more complicated."
"
Shuffle the deck(s) of cards.,
Hand out an equal number of cards to each player.,
Randomly eliminate any extra cards.

,
Decide if the game will go clockwise or counter-clockwise.

,
Have everyone lay their cards in a pile face-down in front of them; no card is more valuable than another.

,
Allow the first person to place their card face-up in the center of the group.

,
Allow everyone to continue placing down their cards until the previous and current card placed match.

,
Slap the center pile when two consecutive cards match (pair), when a Queen and King are placed down consecutively(marriage), when a Queen and Jack are placed down consecutively (affair)or when two of the same number are separated by one card (sandwich).,
When someone lays down a face card, the person that goes after them has to put down the right amount of cards, and if one of them is another face card, the game continues on regularly, but if a face card is not laid down in the right number of cards, the person who laid the original face card gets to pick up the entire pile.,
Let players that were eliminated because they didn't have any cards come back in if they can be the first ones to slap.

,
Announce the winner when one person has won all the cards into their pile.

Keep playing until one player reaches 500 points.",How to Play Rummy 500," In order to play Rummy 500, you are going to need a few simple materials. You will also need 2 to 8 players (including yourself). Gather your friends, plus a standard deck of cards (with two Jokers), a pen or pencil, and some paper., “Shuffling” is just a fancy way to say “mixing up the cards.” The most effective shuffling method is known as the “riffle shuffle,” but you can try any method that works for you. Chances are, at least one person you’re playing with is good at shuffling.


Try the “riffle shuffle” by dividing the deck in half, bending each half in each of your hands, and “riffling” the two halves together.
You may also try an “overhand shuffle” or a “Hindu shuffle.”

, Start by selecting one player to be the dealer for the first round. The first round will begin with the person to the left of the dealer. During the next round, the player who went first will deal, and the person to the left of them will begin. The dealer will deal the cards by placing one card face down in front of each player, moving clockwise, until the right number of cards have been distributed to each person. The dealer always deals to their self last.


In a game with 3 or more players, each player will receive 7 cards.
In a game with only 2 players, each player will receive 13 cards.

, The remaining cards will be placed in a pile in the center of the table. This is called the “stock pile” because it is where players will draw cards at the beginning of each turn. Be sure to position the stock pile in a place where all players can reach it.This is sometimes called a “draw pile.”

, The objective of Rummy 500 is to lay down sets of 3 of more cards. These can be matched sets of 3-4 cards (such as Queens, 5s, 2s, etc.), and/or sequences of 3 or more cards in the same suit (such as the 4, 5, and 6 of spades). The round is finished when one player uses all of their cards or the stock pile runs out. All points are then tallied.These groups of 3 or more cards are called “melds.”
Additionally, players can lay down 1-2 cards that match with existing melds on the table. (For example, if one player has a meld of 3 Aces, another player can lay down the fourth Ace.)
Jokers are used as wildcards, and can represent any card a player wants.

, Whenever cards are laid down in these patterns, they accrue points. To win Rummy 500, one player must reach 500 points, over multiple rounds of play.Card values are as follows:


All face cards are worth 10 points.
Aces count as 15 points when used “high.”
Jokers (used as wildcards) are worth 15 points.
All other cards (Ace low – 9) are worth their value (e.g., the 6 of hearts is worth 6 points.)
You may choose to have all cards A-9 worth 5 points, to simplify the scoring system.

, When one player uses all of their cards, the round ends and points are tallied up. Players who still have cards in their hands tally the value of those cards, and then subtract that amount from their score for that round. Alternatively, if the stock pile runs out of cards, the round ends, but players do not subtract the value of their hands.For example, if the value of a players hand equals 70 points, and the value of what they have laid down equals 100 points, they will earn 30 points for that round.
If a player loses more points from their hand than they have earned in the round, the negative value will be subtracted from their overall score.

, There are some additional, optional rules that you may like to use. Be sure to discuss these rules and accept or reject them before you begin game play.30 points rule: This rule states that players must earn at least 30 points in one round before they are able to add points to their overall score. Once players are on “on the board,” any point value can count.
Boathouse rule: This rule states that players must discard on every turn, including the one in which they “go out.”
Stock pile re-fill rule: In standard Rummy 500, when the stock pile runs out of cards, the round ends. However, some players instead choose to reshuffle the stock pile and continue playing until one player goes out.
Rummy rule: This rule states that any time a player discards a card that could meld with an existing set on the table, the first player to call out “Rummy” gets to take that card and lay it in front of them (earning that card’s score).

, Each player’s turn begins by them picking up the top card from the stock pile and placing it in their hand., Another option is for a player to pick up a card from the discard pile. The discard pile should be spread out, so that each card is visible. Rather than choosing a face-down card from the stock pile, a player may select a card that they can use from the discard pile.But there are a few rules when drawing a card from the discard pile:


The player must pick up all cards on top of the card they want.
The player must use the bottom card to create a meld during that turn.
The remaining cards may either be melded during that turn, or added to the player’s hand.

, This includes 3-4 matching cards, such as 3 Aces, 4 Jacks, or 3 2s. This also includes 3 or more sequential cards of the same suit, such as the 10, Jack, and Queen of hearts. Finally, this can include additions to any meld already on the table. For instance, if 3 10s are already melded on the table, a player possessing the 4th 10 could lay it down during their turn., Each player’s turn ends when they place a card down on the discard pile. All melds must be completed before this is done. Once a discard is placed, play moves on to the next player. A discard cannot be taken back., After each round, the scores are tallied and written down. Continue playing rounds in this fashion until one player reaches 500.

Carry a large bag.,
Buy (or find) a notebook, then start filling it up with random things.,
Start putting in 'earpieces' (Even a rolled up sheet of Kleenex colored silver or black will work).,
When you know somebody is coming back into the room, get on the phone and start saying things like: ""Yes, I have the Istanbul problem covered, General."",
Start finding 'bugs' when she/he's in the room.,
After studying up on the art of spying, start a 'spy group' with him/her and amaze him/her with your talent.

",How to Trick Someone Into Thinking You're a Spy," It doesn't have to be a backpack or a duffel or anything, a large purse will work. Carry things such as tweezers, a pocket knife, a notebook, a camera, a voice recorder, duct tape, or anything else you can think of. (Note: Make sure the purse isn't really bright. It doesn't have to be black or dark grey, just make sure it's not bright pink with blue polka dots!);
, Example of a page: HTML CODE: 6-82-25-11. Robert Hall very dangerous, do not approach. Crystalline firewall systems: Freezes computer when firewall is breached. (Insert best friends name and information). Put this in your bag. Hint: It might also be useful to have a copy of this on your computer, too. Also you might want to write things in the notebook in languages such as German, Chinese, and Latin. Also in codes that you can decipher.

, Deliberately sit in the corner and talk to 'the person on the other end'. Handle this step carefully, so people don't think you're crazy. If someone starts to look at you strangely, turn your head so that they can just barely see the earpiece, then finger it guiltily. When they notice, pretend to be embarrassed and leave the room.

, But stop just after she/he walks into the room, saying something like this into the phone: ""Bye! Nice... talking to you.""

, (Bugs can just be tiny, wadded balls of tape, colored metallic). Sit down, then groan and look at where the 'bug' is. When he/she notices, pluck it off the wall, being careful to disguise the bug, then flush it into the toilet.

Gather a group of players.,
Choose a deck of cards.,
Shuffle the deck thoroughly.,
Deal the cards face-down one at a time.Starting with the person to the left of the dealer, each person is given one card at a time, and it needs to be face-down.,
Begin play with the player to the left of the dealer.,
Continue clockwise around the table, with each person repeating Step 5, until the first round is completed.,
Call “Snap” when two cards of the same rank appear face-up.,
Take the two piles with matching cards and add them to the bottom of the face-down pile.,
Resume play with the person to the left of the last person who flipped over a card.,
Create a snap pool if two players call “Snap” simultaneously.,
Move a player's face-up pile to the middle of the table for a snap pool if he/she incorrectly calls “Snap!” When a player calls “Snap!” at the wrong time, his/her face-up pile becomes a snap pool.Play is the same as in Step 10.,
Reuse the face-up pile of cards when all cards in the face-down pile are gone.,
Remove players from the game as they run out of cards.",How to Play Snap1," Snap can be played with as few as two players and up to six (or even more).


The game does become a bit hard to control when there are more than six players. It will require a second deck of cards for playing when you go above six players.;
, The deck does not have to be completely full, because what matters are the ranks of the cards and not their suits.


Some people choose to play Snap with decks from other card games, such as Old Maid, as long as the backs of the cards are all the same., Before beginning to pass out cards, the dealer must carefully and thoroughly shuffle the deck.

,


The dealer continues to pass out the cards face-down in piles in front of each player until the last card is dealt.
No players should look at their cards while they are being dealt.

, The first person picks up the card at the top of his/her face-down pile. The card must be turned over very quickly so that he/she cannot see it before anyone else. Then, the card is laid down face-up in a new pile next to the face-down pile.


It is recommended to flip the card over in such a way that the face is away from the player. This way, if the card is flipped too slowly, then the player will be the last person to see it., At the end of the round, each person should have one card face-up next to his/her larger pile of face-down cards.

, This game requires the skill of paying attention to what is going on around you, as well as to what you are doing.The first person to notice that two cards with the same rank (i.e. 6, King, 2, et cetera) are face-up yells “Snap!”


Remember that the suit does not matter.
The person who calls “Snap!” does not have to be one of the players with the matching cards, although you can play a variation with the rule that it does have to be one of those players.

, The player who successfully calls “Snap!” first gets to take both piles of face-up cards and add them to the bottom his/her own face-down card pile., The game should immediately continue after the two matching piles have been collected.


The players who lose their face-up piles will start new ones from their remaining face-down pile. This means that they are closer to being out, unless they win piles by calling “Snap!”

, When this happens, take the two matching piles and combine them into one pile in the middle of the table.This is the snap pool.


Play will resume, and when someone draws a card that matches the top card of the snap pool pile, the first player to yell “Snap pool!” first wins the middle pile.

,


Players must continue playing with the cards they have left if they lose their piles.

, Pick up your face-up pile of cards, turn it face-down without shuffling, and continue play.


Eventually, as the game gets closer to the end, players with strong memories can memorize the order of their cards so that they can spend more time looking at their opponent's piles to call “Snap!”, When a player is completely out of cards, he/she is out of the game.


The winner of the game is the player who wins all of the cards.

Observe the footprints.,
Measure the footprints.,
Cast the footprints.,
Take into consideration the depth of the footprint.,
Consider aspects of the footprint that are atypical.,
Consider the footprint as a whole.,
Check for scuff marks.,
Look at the overall locations of the prints.",How to Use Footprints in Detecting," Get yourself a good magnifying glass for the finer details, or at least good eyesight for spotting the footprints.;
, The size of a person’s shoe usually gives the height of the person to a given range. This ratio is rather accurate; however there is a certain percentage of the population, around 10-20%, which this deduction would not apply. Therefore take note of this when deducing a person’s height merely from the length of the shoe. However, when combined with the length of the persons stride, i.e. the length from one heel to the next or one toe to the next, the two calculations give a much better estimate as to the person’s height.

, Now on to imprinted footprints in a medium. The most natural thing that can be gathered from these is the type of shoe that the person is wearing, be it sport, dress or anything else. Heels are especially clear in this aspect, but platform shoes may be hard to distinguish from men’s dress shoes. But of course, knowing the print of the shoe means that with the aid of a database, the brand and exact model of the shoe can be determined. But do keep in mind, the brand and model of the shoe may not be useful in investigations as the person may have thrown away the incriminating pair of shoes. Nonetheless, it is still a useful thing in the case of a careless criminal.

, The depth of the footprints can also be very useful, indicating the persons weight quite accurately, given that the weight was distributed evenly throughout the shoe. A change in depth indicates that the person’s weight has changed, evidently due to carrying some heavy object and then putting it down.

, Now we move on to cases where the weight is not distributed evenly throughout the footprint, i.e. the depth of the footprint is not even. If one side’s footprint is deeper than the other, with no noticeable difference in the ground medium, then either the person is carrying something especially heavy on one side, which would be rather practically flawed, or the person limps; the injured foot is the one with the lighter print. Undoubtedly the explanation of a limp seems much more plausible in most cases, but use discretion always.


If the footprint is heavier on the toes, two explanations are likely. The first is in the case of the footprints being rather far apart for a person of that size. This can be easily determined once the range of the person’s normal height is found using the above described methods. If this is the case, the person is most likely running, or at least moving at a speed that is faster than a brisk walk, as his/her feet lift off the ground at a certain point.
In the second case, the footprints are still regularly placed apart, with regards to the person’s height, once again determined by the above described methods. In this case, the person is probably walking on tiptoe to avoid being detected. There are also marks to be seen besides those of the footprints. The presence of scuff marks will also indicate the person is shuffling, probably indicating a slow walker, possibly somewhat aged.

, Now with regards to tracking footprints in the form of residue left behind from the shoe/foot, the situations involving uneven heaviness of the footprint within the foot or between the feet cannot be used as accurately as in the above mentioned cases, but still may be useful. For example, if you find footprints that only have toe markings in paint, normally spaced, the person could be either tip-toeing or walking normally, since it is possible that the paint was only spread over the tip of his shoe. However, footprints made with residue rubbed off the shoe have one large advantage over the previously described form of footprints, in the sense that the footprints are much easier to find and isolate in the mind’s eye.

, There is also the case of scuff marks left on a wall beside a window due to a person going through the window in a variety of methods. The scuff marks tend not to give much information as to the direction of travel, but when combined with other factors, the situations become much more defined.


If there is a full footprint on the floor, you can use that to determine the direction that the person was facing when he/she entered the room, but usually the person is facing the wall if the footprints on the ground are full.
If there are only toe prints, the person was probably facing the room as he entered; i.e. his/her back was facing the window.

, Of course, if the toe prints point towards the window, there should be another set of full, or at least toe footprints behind them. If the toe/footprints point towards the wall, then the person was going out at that point of time, scuffing the wall with his toes. If they point away from the wall, then the person was just getting down from the window. If there are no toe scuff marks on the wall whatsoever, but there are full footprints near to the window on the ground facing away from the wall then the person jumped from the window into the room.

Practice tip-toeing around.,
Practice staying out-of-sight.,
Try to get some cool spy gadgets.,
Don't go over board with gadgets.,
Practice your night vision.,
Train yourself to defend.,
Work at ducking and dodging.,
Train your body to not rely on sight so much.Getting accustomed to using your other senses can really come in handy.,
Learn to stand still.,
Create hand signals to communicate if you work with a partner.",How to Train Yourself to Be a Spy," Especially if you have wooden floors. Creaks can always give a spy away. When walking, stay near walls as the floor in those areas will creak less, and travel down stairs on all fours. When walking, land feet on the ball of your foot and roll into the toes, making no noise.;
, Always find places to hear but you're still not noticed. Listening through vents is one of the best techniques for hearing secret conversations while not being seen. Stay low, and do what you can to not move if suspected.

, Even household items can be very useful. You can watch videos on YouTube on how to make cheap and effective tools to help you. The most useful of all tools is a recording device, such as an audio recorder, wire or notepad.

, Take what you know you'll need not what you think you'll want!, The best time for missions is during the night, where you can't be seen. To get a better night vision, duck low and use light reflecting off of objects to see better. Wait 20 minutes to have full night vision.

, In case you get caught, you will need to defend. Escape is always good, but be ready to disable the target then escape.

, It's not very likely that you'll get away from a gunman, but it's good to be prepared. Get a partner and let him throw soft balls, such as tennis balls, at you and you must dodge them. It is encouraged to also stretch before doing any espionage.
, Try sitting in a quiet, dark room for extended periods of time to hone and develop senses.

, If you're trying to blend in, it won't work if you're jumping around like a kangaroo. Practice getting into a prone position quickly without hassle. This may also come in handy.

, You'll never know if someone could be listening, so practice something like navy hand signals, or use a code (morse, roman sticks, anagrams, etc.).

, You can choose to play with education-themed cards for kids instead of regular playing cards.The deck does not have to be a full 52 cards.

, If children are playing, assist them in shuffling the cards or simply shuffle the deck for them.

No one should look at their cards while they are being dealt.

, This player turns the card at the top of his/her pile over and places it face-up in the middle of the table.


All players will add to this central pile of face-up cards throughout the game.

, Each player will flip over the top card of his/her pile and place it at the top of the center pile.


Each player must turn over his/her top card quickly so that no advantage is given to one person by seeing the card first.

, The player who calls “Snap!” collects the center pile and adds it to the bottom of his/her face-down pile.Play resumes after the pile has been collected.

, When this happens, push the center pile off to the side. Continue play with a new pile. The first player to spot a card that matches the top card in the original center pile calls “Snap pool!” and collects both piles. The cards are added to the bottom of his/her face-down pile., When this happens, the player who wrongly called “Snap!” must give the top card of his/her face-down pile to the player on whose card they mistakenly called “Snap!”, When the other players of the game are out because they ran out of cards, the player who is still holding cards or who has won most of the cards by calling “Snap!” wins the game.

Gather members.,
Give club a name: (E.G.,
Make positions in your club, Head Spy, Scout, Tracker, Tech master, Wheel Artist, Stealth Master and Social Engineer.,
Make spy names for everyone: You can give names to members (make sure they like their name!),
Create ID cards, badges, or some other token to identify people as members and what rank, position, and name they have: You may want to make this something that is inconspicuous or easy to conceal, so that it is revealed only to other spies.,
Now, you should make a secret password and secret handshake for your club: To make it fun you can all make one and have a vote if someone has a better one than yours.

You may want to recruit your friends, and people you know at school, or in your neighborhood. You can gather members before or after you start making the actual club, whichever you want. Just remember to be patient with any loud members. Remember to get people who will help you such as someone who knows how to use the computer well or a short person so they can fit into small spaces, people who have sharp eyes and smart.


Tech spy






Be sure that the people who have joined tell no-one, not even their moms, and make sure they follow all the rules.;
,: S.A.C., Secret Agency of Children) Make it something catchy and have it end with something cool like S.S. (Spy Squad)., Remember that you can have more than one of these positions in your club. It's good to have at least five members in your group for safety, fun and success.

Other positions you might consider are:


The Head Spy-the Head Spy controls the whole entire club and can change anything they want, whenever they want. This person is the most powerful person in the club.
The Vice Spy-whenever the Head Spy is not there (maybe he/she is sick), the Vice Spy takes his/her place.
The Computer Spy-the computer spy finds information, maps, and other things on the Internet, and sends the information to the head spy.
The Conclusion Spy-The rest of the spies give all their information to the Conclusion Spy, and the Conclusion Spy tries to solve whatever case you are working on with all the information he or she has.
The Regular Spy-the Regular Spy does a lot of the spying. He/she must be stealthy and must blend in easily, and also must be able to befriend even the worst people you could meet.
The Photo Spy-the person who take the photos, videos, and recording. They gather information and give it to the conclusion spy.
Trainee Spy-Trainees are simply people who are being trained to spy on people. The Head and the Vice Spy usually are the ones training a trainee.
The Secretary-This should be someone everyone knows so they can come to them and you have a case!
The Wheel Artist-This member has all of the transportation: It would be cool if they had a car, but a fleet of bicycles, scooters, or skateboards will do well too!






Spy Dogs-Spy Dogs are well-trained dogs that can be allies of the tracker: You can even put a tiny spy camera on their collar!







, or let them make their own. If they can make their own, you can give them guidelines to follow, like if your club is called The Shadows, you could make everyone have 'shadow' in their name (Shadow Dragon, Shadow Hawk, Shadow Bomber, etc.).

, You could all wear rings of a certain style to show your membership, with other information scratched into the ring band, or have bracelets that can easily be hidden under a sleeve.

,, It is a good idea to have multiple headquarters, like an out-of-the-way spot at school, and maybe a secret area at each spy's hive where you can all meet if you are at their hive.

Also, you can find a place that is a fair distance from everybody's hive so that no one has to drive there. The clubhouse is where you should make all your meetings and stick special secret papers to the wall so that everyone in the club knows what's happening around the club.

, Each mat has a dark side and a light side. The dark side signifies that you have not gained a point yet.

, Each player will begin the round by placing one of their four cards face down on their mat. Once everyone has a card placed, determine who goes first. This can be done in any sort of way (who bought the game goes first, youngest goes first, roll a die, etc.)

,


Place another card. You can choose to place a card on top of the existing card(s). If you choose to do this, your turn ends and the turn order continues in clockwise order.
Issue a challenge. Challenges are done to score points in skull. To issue a challenge, you must call out a number of cards starting with one. You can only call out the maximum number of cards that are down at the time you issued the challenge.

, Once a challenge has been issued, no new cards may be placed by any player. Players must choose to raise the number of cards or pass. If a player passes, their turn is skipped until the challenge has been resolved. Once all but one player passes or a player chooses to call out the maximum number of cards, that player must resolve the challenge. If you cannot place down another card, you must issue a challenge.

Example: In a game with three players, each player puts down one card at the start of the game. Player one decides to put down another card. Player two decides to do the same, as does player three. Player one decides to put down one more card, but now player two decides to issue a challenge. Player two bets he can flip over two cards without revealing a skull. Player three bets she can flip over three cards. Player one does not feel confident enough to flip over more than three cards so he skips his turn. Player two raises the bet to four cards. Player three also decides to skip her turn, so player two must now resolve the challenge. See next step to see how to resolve a challenge.

, The player resolving the challenge must now flip over the number of cards he or she had called out. The challenger must flip over all of their own cards first before flipping anyone else's. Once they have flipped over their own cards and have not flipped over a skull, they may continue to flip over cards until they flip over the number of cards they had called out during the challenge phase. Cards must be flipped over from top to bottom only. As soon as the resolving player flips over a skull, do not flip over any more cards. See next step to see what to do in case of revealing a skull.

, When a skull is revealed by the resolving player, everyone returns their cards to their hand without revealing any cards that were not flipped over. The resolving player must then lose one of their cards. If the skull revealed was one of another player, that player will randomly choose which card is discarded. If the skull revealed was your own, you must randomly discard one of your own cards. A new round is started afterwards. The resolving player will go first in the next round.

, If the resolving player is able to flip over the number of cards they have called out and they do not flip over a skull, they win that round. All unrevealed cards are returned to their respective players' hands. The resolving player will then flip over their mat to show the light side, signifying they have won the challenge.

, You get eliminated if:


You fail four challenges. If a player reveals a skull in all four of their challenges, they will have lost all of their cards. This player will then set aside their mat and all their cards and will sit out the rest of the game. Even if a player had won a challenge before, they can still be eliminated.
The last card in hand is a skull. If the only card left after discarding all other cards is a skull, you must issue a challenge as usual. Once you or another player reveals your last card, you are immediately eliminated from the game. If another player revealed your card, they lose the challenge and discard a card as normal.

, You win the game if:

You complete two challenges. Gameplay continues until one player successfully completes two challenges (does not flip over any skulls).
You are the last player standing. The game can also end if all other players are eliminated and only one player is left standing. A player can win the game even if they failed to resolve any number of challenges, so long as they are not eliminated.

, If your fort is inside, don't worry about the sticks and branches.

, If you want it to be permanent, then use a hammer and nails. If not, then don't. Just remember that you might have to relocate at a moments notice!

, Remember to use the branches and broom handles as support beams so the roof won't sag in the center. Also, Be sure to reinforce all the walls to ensure that they cannot be kicked in. Build a door and a couple of windows. Once the basic structure is assembled and complete, spray paint it camouflage so it will not be noticed.

Verify that your babysitter is entertaining to spy on.,
Get some friends in on the spying.,
Elect a distractor.,
Find a good place to hide.,
Grab proper spying supplies.,
Begin to spy.,
Take some notes.,
Get up a few times to get something to drink or eat.,
Admit it when they leave.",How to Spy on the Babysitter," If your babysitter happens to be an extremely boring person with no life, there's no point in spying on him or her. Make a checklist of things you'd enjoy seeing from the babysitter. Examples:


A boyfriend/girlfriend to talk with
A busy family to argue with
An annoying roommate to scream at;
, Get your cousins or siblings to help you, or maybe your neighbors to help. Make sure they are not noisy, will not give anything away, and are good at spying. The more the merrier, as they say!

, The distractor should be a few feet away from the babysitter, playing with something or watching TV, minding their own business. This is good to have because the babysitter will not come looking for all of you if someone is there. They will feel more comfortable and will be happier to talk on the phone or go on the computer or something.

, Under the couch, behind the couch, under the desk, in the desk, etc. Find a place that can fit the people you have, and can let you be hidden and not seen. It's a good idea to split everyone up in different places, just in case you can't hear something from one angle, the other people can hear it from another angle. The spot should also be near the spot the babysitter hangs around, such as in a chair or on the rug or near the couch.

, You don't need to buy anything, but grab useful and appropriate items. A camera, a video camera, a phone to take pictures or to call/text your friends on, some walkie talkies, a notepad to jot things down, and a flashlight for distracting or if you're in a dark place are good things to have.

, Keep quiet! Get everything in place and make secret code names and things. Have fun with it.

, Don't take down very personal information, like their social security number, just take funny things, like the things they say and the fights they get in.

, This way it won't look like anything, just some kid thing, and that you're not doing anything suspicious.

, There isn't anything they can do about it, and remind them that it was just a kid thing and that they didn't take anything important down. You may even want to show you what you got, just so they know that it's safe to come back!

Use common sense: if you're stalking your friend at a beach in the hot summer, wear a bathing suit; if you're stalking him/her in the rain, wear a rain jacket and carry an umbrella.
If you're stalking at night, wearing dark clothing may help you remain unseen; however, in the event you are spotted you will seem more suspicious. Many people walk/jog/run at night, so athletic clothing may be a good choice.
Don't dress flashy: err on the side of muted colors.Don't overthink your attire: dress like everyone else.;
, Your friend obviously knows what you look like and how you normally dress, so you'll probably want to alter your appearance slightly.


Depending on how determined you are, you could go to a thrift store and buy some inexpensive clothing so that your friend won't recognize your usual style.
Wearing a hoodie can be effective, but it can also make you stand out, particularly when wearing a hoodie up draws attention.
If you normally wear your hair a certain way, try styling it differently. If it doesn't feel like you, that's a good thing because it probably doesn't look like you either.
If you're not usually a hat person, wearing a hat will definitely make you unrecognizable to your friend at a quick glance.
Don't go for an elaborate disguise: less is more in this case. You don't want to draw attention to yourself.

, Your friend is going to recognize your face, so consider wearing something to slightly obscure it.


If it's sunny, consider buying a cheap pair of sunglasses to cover your eyes.
If it's cold out, wear a scarf that can cover the bottom half of your face.
If you wear make-up, perhaps apply it differently, maybe thicker.

, In some cases, you may need additional supplies for your stealth operation. Here are some supplies you might consider bringing along in a backpack:


Binoculars. Although good for observing from long distances in nature, in urban areas binoculars will probably stand out.
A long-distance lens. A camera with a long-distance lens is good for observing your friend from afar just as long as you're not always focused on him/her: make it look like you're an amateur photographer taking pictures.A spare outfit. If your friend spots you but doesn't recognize you, that's a good time to change your outfit (and personal effects) because if he/she spots you again in the same clothing he/she will definitely become suspicious.

, Before you start stalking your friend, think up a reason for why you are where you are. In the event your friend notices and confronts you, this will be your explanation.This is especially important when stalking at night, when there are fewer people around to blend in with and there are fewer reasons to be outside.
Here are some ideas for explanations: you dropped something; you're looking for lost pet; you're lost; you're walking home (from somewhere).

, Where you're stalking your friend (e.g. a beach, a store, a restaurant) should determine your behavior -- which should appear natural to the environment.


If your friend is shopping, you, too, should appear to be shopping. But if your friend is shopping at store where you might stand out (e.g. for women: a cigar shop; for men: a lingerie shop), then perhaps a better idea would be to wait casually outside for him/her to emerge.If you don't know how to act in a certain place, remember: do what everyone else is doing.

, This doesn't mean crouching behind bushes or diving into garbage cans. Rather, use cover appropriately for the situation. Here are some examples:


If you're at a bookstore and your friend is approaching your direction, lower your face into the book as though you were short-sighted.
If you're at the park, leaning behind a tree is normal behavior -- so use that tree for cover!
If your environment offers no suitable cover, use your phone: hold it low and bow your head to hide your face. People do this all the time, so you'll look normal.
Remember that you never know who else might be watching you, so avoid suspicious crouching and hiding even when you think you're unseen.

, Even if you're only following your friend walking down the street, appear engaged in either your thoughts or the sights.


Very few people stare straight ahead while they walk, so don't always keep your eyes trained on your friend.
As it is seldom done and will likely broadcast your stalking hijinks, eye contact is the wrong kind of engagement, especially with the friend whom you are stalking.

, Approaching too closely increases the risk of your friend spotting you, so keep just close enough so that you can always see them.If you're following your friend by car, keep a few car distances behind you and them, with cars in between. Remember, all you need is enough of a distance to see where they're headed and not to lose them if they turn.If you're in nature (e.g. the woods), one way of keeping your distance while observing your friend is to use binoculars or a long-distance camera lens.A greater distance between you and your target might be necessary at night due to the absence of other people.

, Rather than a ""hawk's gaze,"" you should keep a ""soft focus"" on your friend because you don't want to alert suspicion or make eye-contact if they were to turn toward you unexpectedly.


A ""soft focus"" utilizes your peripheral vision, so that where your nose is pointing isn't necessarily where you're actually looking., Managing the sound you make is most important when you're stalking at night, as there typically are fewer people around at that time.


Walking quietly is largely a matter of balance: keep your legs bent and practice slow, heel-to-toe steps on the outer edge of your feet.Watch where you step so that you don't accidentally step on something, such as a branch, and alert your friend to your presence.

, If you see that your friend has spotted and identified you, running away will only raise his/her suspicions when you don't really know if they're even suspicious yet.

, Don't overdo it, but be surprised to have run into them. If you're feeling really confident, you could even act like you're delighted to see them, which will probably shake them of the suspicion that you were following them.

, When your friend asks why you are where you are, give your explanation that you planned beforehand.

, If your friend doesn't believe your planned explanation, your last chance at saving face is to act incredulous at their incredulity. If you get the urge to laugh, let it out because the situation is indeed ridiculous.

, If your friend refuses to believe your planned explanation and your incredulity, the jig is probably up and it's time to tell them the truth about what you were doing.

Draw a map of your house.,
Draw your route on the map with a different color than what you used to make the map.,
Draw at least 1 other plan, in case one goes wrong.

,
Think up excuses for WHY you're spying.,
Get some gear like mirrors, periscopes, and short-range magnifiers like toy binoculars.

,
Wear clothing that somewhat resembles the color of the wall.,
Breathe silently through your nose.

,
Wear socks.,
If going up or down a staircase, stick close to the wall.,
Stay below the waist level of your target.

,
Hide in plain sight.,
If somehow, all of your plans go south, wing it.",How to Spy on People in Your Household," Draw different floors on different pieces of paper. (E.x. If your bedroom is on the top floor, but your kitchen is on the ground floor, draw them on separate pieces of paper).;
, Use arrows for movement. Draw circles around objectives, and use X's for hiding places.

,, For example, If you are crouched behind a corner, keep a coin on hand that you can set it down so you can say ""I'm looking for my quarter."" Keep it simple.

,, If your clothes are not even close, avoid bright colors and things that will stand out (E.x. Don't wear black if your walls are white).

,, Avoid wood floors.

, That is where stairs are the least creaky. Same thing with wood floors. Stick to the wall.

,, For example, if you have to hide in a bedroom with a messy bed, hide under the covers and STAY FLAT.

, Try to get the mission back on course.

Adhere same-size pieces of foam together.,
Sand down the ends of the pipe.,
Tape off the end of the pipe.,
Apply adhesive to the end of the pipe.,
Apply adhesive to each 54-inch (137-cm) foam pad.,
Wrap the foam around each end of the pipe.,
Cover the foam tube with tape.,
Create a second end cap.,
Rough up the pipe with sandpaper.,
Apply adhesive to the final foam pad.,
Wrap the pad around the center of the pipe.,
Secure the pad in place with tape.,
Spray the hand guards with adhesive.,
Fold the inner hand guards around the pipe.,
Place the outer hand guards over the inner hand guards.,
Cover the guards with tape.,
Wrap the rest of the pipe with additional tape.,
Heat the duct tape with a heat gun.,
Test the final product.",How to Make Pugil Sticks," Spray one side of each 9-by-27 inch (23-by-68 cm) and 11-by-19 inch (28-by-48 cm) piece of foam. Place the adhesive side of one piece of foam onto the adhesive side of a same-size piece. Repeat for the other six pieces.At the end of this step, you should have two pieces of double layered 9-inch (23-cm) foam and two pieces of double layered 11-inch foam (28-cm).
These pieces of foam will form the hand guards. The smaller pieces will be used for the inner guards and the larger pieces will be used for the outer guards.
Set these pieces aside for later. Make sure that the adhesive is dry before using these pieces again.;
, Use sandpaper to rough up 8 inches (20 cm) from both ends of the PVC pipe.


Roughing up the PVC pipe will help the adhesive spray and duct tape stick to it more effectively.
You should also sand along the edges of the pipe end. The idea is to round it off. Do not sharpen the edges to a point, though.
After sanding the PVC pipe, you should wipe away any shavings or dust with a damp rag.

, Apply several piece of duct tape over each open end of the PVC pipe. Use enough duct tape to thoroughly cover the entire rough edge of each end.


Remove about 2 feet (0.6 m) (61 cm) of the tape. Stick 1 foot (0.30 m) (30 cm) down along the end of the pipe, then fold the other 1 foot (0.30 m) (30 cm) over the top and down the other side. Fold the overhanging tape over onto the pipe. This effectively ""caps"" the edge.
Double up the tape, if desired, to make things even safer.
This process makes the pipe a little less dangerous if it happens to come loose while the pugil stick is in use. With this sharp edge being capped, a person is less likely to be cut or injured by the end of the pipe.

, Coat 8 inches (20 cm) of each pipe end with adhesive spray.


Note that it might be easiest to work with one end at a time from this point on. If you attempt to work with both ends at the same time, the adhesive might dry before you have a chance to work with it.

, Coat one side of each 11-by-54 inch (28-by-137 cm) foam pad with spray adhesive.

, Stick the 11-inch (28-cm) side of one foam pad to one of the pipe ends. Wrap the rest of the foam around the pipe, rolling it into a neat cylinder.


There should be 3 inches (7.6 cm) of foam hanging off the end of the pipe.

, Wrap duct tape around the foam tube, covering the foam completely and further reinforcing its bond to the PVC pipe.Apply the tape along the length of the cylinder, not around the circumference.
Make sure that the duct tape overhangs the pipe-end of the foam cylinder by about 5 inches (). Stick this overhanging duct tape to the bottom of the cylinder and onto the pipe.
Repeat this process until the entire cylinder is covered, overlapping the proceeding piece of tape with each new piece of tape you apply.
Seal the exposed ends of your tape strips by wrapping additional pieces of tape around the circumference of the cylinder.

, Use the same procedure to create a second end cap.


Apply spray adhesive to the last 8 inches (20 cm) of the opposite pipe end.
Apply adhesive to the other foam pad.
Roll the short end of the pad around the bare end of the pipe, leaving 3 inches (7.6 cm) of foam hanging off the end of the pipe.
Wrap this foam cylinder thoroughly with duct tape.

, Use the sandpaper to rough up the rest of the exposed PVC pipe.


As before, roughing up the pipe makes it easier for the duct tape and adhesive spray to stick to it.

, Spray one side of the 7-by-13 inch (18-by-33 cm) foam pad with multipurpose adhesive.


This piece of foam will become the center guard of the pugil stick.

, Align the center of the 13-inch (33-cm) side with the center of the PVC pipe. Stick the pad in place, then roll it around itself, wrapping up the center of the pipe.

, Wrap duct tape around the center guard padding, covering it completely.


As with the end caps, you should apply the tape around the center guard lengthwise and not around the circumference. Leave 5 inches (13 cm) of overhang off each end. Flatten the overhang to the sides of the guard, then onto the pipe.
Cover the entire center guard with tape. Each new piece of tape should slightly overlap the piece that came before it.

, Return to your four double-layer hand guard pieces. Spray one side of each piece with adhesive spray, covering it completely.


As before, it might be best to work with one piece at a time. Spray and wrap one hand guard, then spray and wrap the next. If you spray each one at the same time, the adhesive may not work as effectively by the time you work with the last one.

, Take one portion of double layer 9-by-27 inch (23-by-68 cm) padding and center it around the pugil stick, positioning it just to the inside of the end cap. Fold the foam in half over the stick.


The long edge should be the edge that you stick to the pipe.
Repeat this step with the other inner hand guard foam and the other end of the pipe.

, Position one piece of double layer 11-by-19 inch (28-by-48 cm) padding over the inner hand guard foam. Fold this piece of foam in half, sandwiching the pipe and inner guard inside.


The long edge of this foam should be the edge stuck to the pipe. Position it so that it lies flush against the end cap.
Repeat this step with the other outer hand guard foam and the other end of the pipe.

, Wrap duct tape over the hand guards, covering them completely.


As before, you should make sure that the tape completely covers the padding while also adhering it to the PVC pipe. Partially overlap each piece of tape with the piece that follows it.

, Wrap the rest of the PVC pipe with duct tape, completely covering the entire thing.


Cover all exposed pipe, as well as all visible tape ends left behind from previous wrappings.
The tape should overlap itself with each roll, and it should not be too even or smooth. Leave wrinkles and bumps in it. A smooth layer will be too slippery, but a wrinkled layer of tape will be easier to grasp.

, Use a heat gun to warm up the tape on the pugil stick. After heating the tape, allow it to cool to room temperature.


After heating the duct tape, press down on it with your hands to fix it more firmly in place.
If you don't have a heat gun, set the pugil stick down on a hot surface during a hot, sunny day. Leave the stick there for several hours, turning it occasionally so that all sides are evenly heated.
The heat spreads out the adhesive of the duct tape. As a result, the tape will stick more firmly and securely once the pugil stick cools off.

, Try to ""wiggle"" or move each piece of foam attached to the pipe. Each piece should feel firmly stuck in place.


If any of the pieces move, you should secure them in place with additional duct tape.
If all of the pieces seem firm and in place, the pugil stick is now complete.

Now, use a bread knife to cut the boards into strange shaped pieces. For 4-5 year olds, three pieces is enough. 6-8 year olds can handle four or five, and from there on up, six or seven pieces should work.;
, Have a ""narrator."" When s/he yells ""Fried shrimp!"" the kids lay on their backs if they can and wiggle their fingers. When the narrator says, ""Seasick!"" everyone grabs a partner. Their partner puts their hands out like the railing on the boat and the other person reaches their head over the ""railing"" and barfs. Be sure to remind them not to get too energetic. If someone does not have a partner they're out. When the narrator calls, ""Shore!"" the players run to their right. If someone runs left he/she's out. If the narrator calls ""Ship!"" the remaining players run to their left. If a child runs right he/she's out. When a narrator says, ""Captain's Coming!"" Have the children put the sides of their hands on their foreheads, and stay still. When an adult shouts anything else for example, ""Seasick!"" the kids stay still. If anyone moves before the adult says, ""Yaarg!"" they're out. The last 5 remaining players win.

, from all the boards around the backyard. Designate each team an area to assemble their puzzle. Three members will work on assembly while one person can run out and get the other pieces. The first team to find and assemble their entire puzzle wins.

, Set up a circle of numbers on the ground and have everyone stand on a number. Begin playing festive music and have everyone walk from number to number. Draw a number from a hat and then stop the music. Whoever is standing on that number when the music stops is the winner! I have played this game at many school carnivals where the prize is a cake. But, you can give away something different.

, Play music and while the music plays all the player's move around. As soon as the music stops all the players need to stop and become a statue. Whoever moves is out of the game. Keep playing the music as long as you want and then give all the participants a nice gift.

, This is yet another fun game. All you need to do is make an easy bean bag using double layer of poster board glued together and a large box. Then use a large box as a base, and attach the poster board to one side of it. Before attaching the poster board, paint a design on it, make one or more hole. The kids will have lot of fun throwing those bean bags. If you want you can even give bean bags as party favors.

, Make a paper airplane for each child. Be sure and weigh down the nose (use a paper clip.) so that the plane will fly straight. Put each child’s name on a plane. Have the children line up across a wall. Tell them to throw their planes when you count to three. The child that tosses their plane the farthest wins the game.

,


Be sure to have 2 beach-balls, 2 goals, open space & Foam weapons. Each team needs 1 or more people on defense (goalies are optional), the rest on offense. The two balls in the middle of the two sides.
The defenders and goalies can kick to block a goal or use their racket/foam weapon. The only thing they can't do is use their hands or block goals with their bodies. If a defender uses their belly to block a ball it is a point for the other team. People cannot use their hands at all, and cannot score a goal with a kick.
If someone scores a goal it counts as 1 point. The first side to win a certain amount of points wins- such as 10, 15, 20 etc.

, It is great for all ages. It requires 2 teams of 8 people or more, 2 goals and 1 beach-ball.You can kick, dribble, punch etc. the ball into the goals WITHOUT HOLDING THE BALL. If someone holds the ball they do 10 jumping jacks instead of going out. Each score in the goal is 1 point. When a certain amount of time is over the team with the most points wins.

Decide the length and thickness you want for your handles, and the length of your cord.,
Gather duct tape and 2 (or 4, if you practice double nunchaku) cardboard pieces.,
Cord should be strong, if it is thin, braid it or find a new cord.,
If you are making double nunchaku, ensure that the cords are the same length.

,
Fold the cardboard horizontally along its natural ""grain"" until it is nice and flexible.

,
Starting from the center of the weapon (the top of each handle), lay the cord the length of the cardboard, roll the cardboard over and lay the cord back up along the freshly rolled cardboard.,
Ensuring that the end of the cord is at the top of the handle (ready to be tied to the middle piece of cord) and the cardboard cylinders are tightly rolled, wrap the handle in duct tape.,
Knot the end of the cord sticking out from the duct tape around the middle piece of cord (the cord that will be holding the handles together).

,
Repeat process for second handle.

,
Test your weapon's strength by spinning it for a few seconds.,
Decorate your nunchaku (optional).

,
Prepare for battle.

",How to Make Cardboard Nunchaku,";
, The pieces should be of the same length and width as each other (i.e. 30cm long, 60cm wide).

, Use this formula for the length of the cord (the length of handle is the length of the cardboard): (length of handle x 8) + 30cm (for distance between handles) + 20cm (for tying off the ends)


The cord is 8 times as long as the handle so that it is fully wrapped through and around the card as the handle is constructed.

,,, Repeat this twice.

, The less cardboard is showing, the stronger your handles will be.

,,, In case of problems, reinforce the handle with further duct tape or consult an internet based knot archive.

Wrap your arrows in duct tape.,
Draw your arrowheads.,
Glue your arrowheads together.,
Attach the arrowhead to your arrow.,
Make a quiver to hold arrows.,
Test your bow and arrow.",How to Make a Toy Bow and Arrow1," You'll want to use a plastic hanger that will not easily snap. Wire hangers should be avoided, as these will easily bend out of shape and will not likely hold up well as a bow. Test the strength of your coat hanger with your hands by tugging on it various directions. If it feels brittle or like it might break, another coat hanger might be better for your bow.;
, The traditional shape of a bow is a smooth arc. To make this, you'll need to remove all hooks from your hanger with a sturdy pair of scissors or a sharp, durable knife. Then, if any sharp edges remain, use a file to blunt the edges.


For stubborn plastic that refuses to cut, you may need to notch the plastic with your knife first, and then cut it with your scissors.
For more authentic bows, you might also remove the plastic connector running between the ends of the arc of your hanger., Take your duct tape and wrap it smoothly around your coat hanger until all surfaces are covered. Be sure your tape is wrapped thickly enough so that no edges of plastic protrude. Colored duct tape can be used to add a personal touch to your bow.


Silver, gold, black, and brown duct tape are good duct tape colors to consider for giving your bow some character.

, The string of your bow should be made of thick, sturdy rubber bands. Depending on the length of your bow and the size of your hanger, three to five bands should be enough to make your string. Cut each in half with your scissors and tie the ends together with simple knots.You can strengthen your bowstring by doubling or tripling the single string with more bands.

, Now that you have your bowstring made, you can tie it to the end of the arc of your coat hanger to complete the bow. If you find that the bowstring doesn't stay in place, take a knife and cut V shaped notches into the plastic at either end. Then you can re-tie your bowstring so that it's seated securely in the notches.

, You'll be using pencils to make your arrows. Wrap these completely in a layer of duct tape to give them a more realistic appearance. You may want to use a different color of duct tape for your arrows than you used for your bow, though this is a matter of preference.

, Draw two triangles on a piece of card stock or rigid cardboard for each arrowhead you plan on making. To make your arrowheads uniform, you can draw an arrowhead stencil, cut it free, and then use this to trace the shapes of the rest of your arrowheads.


Your arrowheads can be as large or as small as you like, but for more polished looking arrowheads, measure out 2-inch (5 cm) sides for all three sides of your triangular arrowhead.

, Take the two pieces of card stock that you have cut into the shape of arrowheads and use your glue to attach these to the tip of your arrow. If the card stock you are using is a little on the flimsy side, you might want to reinforce your arrowheads by putting small pieces toothpicks, cake pop sticks, or kebab sticks between pieces, gluing the supports in place as you glue the pieces together.

, Use your thumb to hold your arrowhead to one of the ends of your arrow. With your free hand, take your duct tape and wrap it around the arrowhead and arrow, connecting the two together firmly.

, Use your ruler to measure the length of you arrows and then subtract an inch (2½ cm) from that length. Mark your cardboard tube with the shorter length and use your scissors to cut the tube so it is an inch shorter than your arrows. Then, use your duct tape to cover the outside of your tube and close off one of the ends.

, Once your arrows are finished, put them in the quiver and take up your bow. Remove an arrow from the quiver and draw it back with the string of your bow. Release to shoot - you and your bow are now ready for adventure.

Use PVC pipe to make a better bow.,
Insert your CPVC into your four foot PVC piece.,
Cut slots into the ends of your long PVC piece with your saw.,
Cut your ¾-inch (1.9 cm) thick piece along one side.,
Attach your handle to your four foot PVC piece.,
Wrap your handle with duct tape.,
Add your arrow holder.,
Measure out your bowstring.,
String your bow.,
Cap your arrows.,
Rest an arrow on your sight and check your handiwork.",How to Make a Toy Bow and Arrow2," A PVC pipe bow will be more authentic than cardboard models or bows made of light plastic. PVC is more ideal for bow-making, as it is rigid enough to provide the tension necessary for firing an arrow, but is not so weak that it will break after a few uses.


CPVC inserts at either end of your PVC bow will serve to reinforce the ends by adding thickness. This will result in a sturdier construction and will also help prevent cracking.

, Gather your long PVC piece and your two 1½-inch long CPVC pieces to begin making your bow. Insert one 1½-inch CPVC piece into the long PVC piece until it is nested completely inside the long PVC piece. The fit will be tight and might require you to twist the smaller piece back and forth, or you may need to tap the small CPVC piece into place gently with a hammer. Do this for both sides.The ends of your short CPVC pieces and your long PVC piece should be even when you finish this.

, You'll also be cutting into the CPVC piece you have nested inside the larger piece. Decide which side of your pipe will be the back of your bow. The back of your bow is the side your string will run along, so your slots will need to be on this side on either end of your long piece.


Your slots should be about ½-inch (1¼ cm) long., Being careful not to cut yourself while doing so, use your saw to cut a straight line from top to bottom on one side of your ¾-inch (1.9 cm) thick piece. This piece will form the handle for your bow., Now that your ¾-inch thick eight inch long piece has a cut from top to bottom, you should be able to feed your long four foot PVC pipe inside of it. Slide your eight inch long handle to the middle of your four foot piece.

, Arrange your handle so that the cut in it faces the front of your bow, which will be the side opposite the slots you've cut in the ends of your four foot PVC piece. Then use your electrical tape to wrap and reinforce the handle.

, Take your paper clip and bend it into the shape of a C, with the bottom end about a ¼-inch ( .6 cm) longer than the top. After this is done, bend the top of the C so that it faces you while the bottom points off to the side. Now you can:


Measure the middle point of the left side of your handle with your tape measure.
Place the bottom of your paper clip at the midpoint with the bottom of the paper clip facing away from the bow and your offset top piece flat against the bow.
Use your electrical tape to attach your paperclip to firmly to the bow.
Note: the top of your paper clip will act as a stopper so your arrow holder does not get pushed back against the bow, but it will allow your holder to move forward and out of the way of arrows when shooting.

, Use your tape measure and cut free a length of paracord that is slightly longer than four feet long. Two to four inches (5 - 10 cm) extra should be ample for the purposes of stringing your bowline and tying knots.Cutting paracord can leave frayed edges. You can ""re-seal"" the ends of your cord by holding it in the flame of a match or lighter for a few moments until the ends melt closed. Allow at least a minute to pass for the ends to cool., Place one end of your paracord in the upper slot and knot it so that it cannot slip through the slot. Now you can take the other end and pull it through the bottom slot until the line is taut. Knot the bottom end the same as you did the top to fix the bowline in place.If it feels like your knots might come loose, you can add zip-ties around the knot to reinforce it.

, Your 24-inch long wooden dowels will each become a single arrow. Take your dowels one at a time and put an eraser cap on each to give it the appearance of a pointed arrow head.To create a sturdier arrow, you might use glue on the end of your dowel. Do this before putting on the eraser cap to create a seal between the arrowhead and arrow.
If you use glue, be sure to allow your arrows to dry completely.

, Take your finished bow and hold it in your left hand. With your right hand, take an arrow and rest it on the paperclip holder on your handle. Line up the flat base of your arrow with your bowstring, pull back arrow and string, and release to shoot.

Find a stick.,
Find a pointed rock.,
Gather glue, string, and feathers.,
Glue the pointed rock to the end of the stick.,
Allow the arrow to dry.,
Cut a small notch at the ""back"" end of the stick.,
Attach the feathers.,
Let the arrow dry again.,
Test your arrow.",How to Make an Arrow1," The shaft of your arrow should be made from a suitable stick or branch. You want a piece of wood that is light yet sturdy and as straight as possible. For a long bow, find a stick that is slightly thicker than a pencil, and about the length of the distance from your wrist to your shoulder.


It's better to stick with a longer stick rather than a shorter stick - you can always break part of a stick off if it's too long, but there's no way to make a short stick longer.;
, Ideally, your rock should have one sharp, pointed end and one flatter end that fits flush against one end of your stick. Good stones will have a cone-shaped or blade-shaped point and be slightly wider than the stick's thickness. If needed, sharpen your rock's point against another rock or a sharpening stone.


Alternatively, you can use sharp pieces of bone if they're available. If you're in an area known for volcanic activity (such as the Hawaiian islands), you may even want to look for naturally-occurring obsidian around old, cooled lava flows.
If you're very dedicated (or lucky), you might be able to find an actual arrowhead - that is, a specially-sharpened rock used by an ancient culture to tip an arrow. Arrowheads are occasionally recovered from places where the earth has been disturbed, such as recently-plowed fields, construction sites, and riverbeds.

, If you're willing to compromise in terms of your arrow's historical authenticity, you can simply use commercial glue (a hot glue gun works best) and normal string or twine. On the other hand, for a truly old-school arrow, you can make a simple glue from flower and water and make string from certain types of tree bark. If possible, get two large bird feathers that are the same size.


The feathers aren't absolutely necessary, but they will improve your arrow's accuracy by stabilizing it as it flies.

, This can be done by cutting a small notch into the stick deep enough to hold about a 1/4 of the length of the rock. Glue the rock in place, then coat the part of the stick near the rock with glue. Wrap a string around the notch and the base of the rock, making sure it grips the stick and the rock tightly. Tie the string securely, then coat it with glue to improve its strength.








, Carefully lay your arrow down so that none of its weight is being supported by the tip and allow it to dry. Leave it in the sun to speed the drying process, carefully turning it over after an hour or so to ensure the glue dries evenly.

, When you fire your arrow, the bowstring will fit into this notch, helping the keep the arrow steady. This notch doesn't have to be terribly deep - 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch will usually do, based on the thickness of your bowstring.








, Cut your feathers down the center. Place some glue on the shaft of your arrow and glue half of the feather down this in a way so it curves slightly. Arrange four feather halves so that they're evenly spaced around the circumference of the back end of the arrow and they all curve in the same direction. The spiral arrangement of the feathers will cause the arrow to turn in a spiral as it flies (like a well-thrown football or a rifle bullet), which tends to make it fly straighter and and more accurately.









Traditionally, a thin cotton thread would be used to tie the feathers on by ruffling them the wrong way so a gap appeared to place the string while the feather was held to the shaft. You may choose to replicate this practice if you desire. If you do, wrap the thread around the feathers so that they're tightly held against the shaft of the arrow, then glue the thread in place.

, Let the glue dry for about 2 hours - your exact drying time will vary depending on the type of glue you use and the construction of your arrow. Again, make sure that your arrow is arranged so that neither the feathers or the point of the arrow are bearing any weight as the glue dries - otherwise, they may dry crooked.

, When you're sure the glue is completely dry, gently flex the tip and the feathers to test their strength. If they're securely attached and don't budge at all, your arrow's ready to fire! Notch your arrow in your bow, pull the bowstring back, aim, and let your arrow fly! Never shoot your arrow at people or animals - even stone age arrows can seriously hurt someone - after all, they were originally used for hunting.

Feathers and beads (optional)
Glue
Paint (gray and brown suggested)
Pencil (optional)
Scissors
Scrap paper (brown preferred)
Cardboard
Twine (optional);
, You might want to consider adding support to the handle to make it more sturdy. You can do this easily by cutting 2 additional separate pieces of the tomahawk handle, which you will use later for support.

To give a 3D appearance to the ax-head of your tomahawk, you can add a couple of pieces of cardboard cut only in the shape of the ax-head. You might want these to be slightly smaller than the full size ax-head. This will give contour and make it even more realistic.

, Your ax-head/handle combined pieces should be glued together first, with your supporting handle-only pieces glued on the outside. The same goes for your ax-head; the slightly smaller ax-head-only pieces should be glued on the outside of the ax-head on the ax-head/handle combined pieces.You should allow your glued together pieces enough time to fully dry before you move on from this stage in the tomahawk making process.

, To make the adhesive for your papier-mâché, you can dilute some normal all-purpose glue (sometimes called PVA glue) in a small amount of water.Use a paintbrush to apply your glue-water solution to your scrap paper and the surface of your cardboard tomahawk.

For scrap paper, you might use thin brown paper, like the kind used for paper lunch bags or grocery bags. Cover the cardboard of your 'hawk so that it has a uniform appearance.
To give a stone-like effect to your ax-head, you might want to crinkle the paper that you paste to it.
To make the handle of your 'hawk appear wooden, you should try to glue your papier-mâché to the handle as smoothly as possible.

, If you are going for the classic appearance, you'll want gray and brown paint for the ax-head and the handle, respectively. Native Americans did not learn ironworking until after the arrival of colonists, so the more authentic 'hawks will have heads made of stone instead of metal., These will depend on your preference, but at this point, you might consider wrapping the head of your 'hawk in twine using a criss-cross pattern that goes around the handle, making it appear as though the head and handle are tied together.You can also:

Give the appearance of wood finish by taping the handle in clear tape.
Glue or tie beads, ribbons, and/or feathers to create a more ceremonial looking 'hawk."

Buy or fashion your shaft(s).,
Square the end of your shaft.,
Attach a point and/or insert to the end of the shaft.,
Add a nock.,
Fletch your arrow.,
Make your finishing touches.",How to Make an Arrow2," Today, there are a wide variety of materials that arrow shafts are constructed from. Some hunters use wooden arrows that aren't functionally very different from old-fashioned arrows, while others prefer high-tech carbon fiber constructions. Shop around for available shaft materials or consider making your own - some sporting good and hunting supply stores even sell special arrow saws that can help you professionally fashion an arrow shaft from a wide variety of materials.If you want to make your own shafts, be sure your shafts are the correct length for your bow setup. If you plan on making your shafts from wood, you may want to have access to a lathe to help round square shafts to a perfect roundness.

, The end of your shaft should be perfectly flat to ensure a good fit when you attach the arrow's point. If you bought a prefabricated arrow shaft, you may not need to do any extra work, but if you're fashioning your arrows from wood, you'll definitely need ensure that the end of the shaft is perfectly square. Press the end of the shaft into an abrasive surface (sandpaper, etc.) and rotate the shaft to square the end.


A arrow-squaring device can be a tremendous help - these ensure that the shaft is held perfectly straight as it is abraded. Arrow-squaring devices are fairly cheap - often retailing for less than $50.

, Ensure the end of the shaft is perfectly square and free of any wood shavings, dirt, etc. Then, affix the arrow's point. This process will vary based on the type of shaft your arrow uses.


For metal or carbon shafts, you may need to first glue or screw in a special metal insert before affixing the point. Consult the vendor or manufacturer if instructions aren't included with the point or insert.
For wooden shafts, you may need to taper the shaft so that the point can be mounted securely. Glue the point over the shaft with archery glue, wiping away any excess.

, The ""nock"" is the small notch at the back of the arrow where the bowstring fits. If you're making an arrow from a wooden shaft, you can carve a shallow nock into the back end of the shaft yourself. You can also buy commercially-available nocks which are designed fit over (or in to) the shaft of the arrow. These are usually brightly-colored plastic so that your arrows are easy to find after firing. Some high-end nocks even contain a small LED so that they glow in the dark, making hunting or target shooting at night much easier.


Make sure your nock is sized correctly so that it fits securely to the shaft before you glue it or screw it in. You definitely don't want a poorly-fitted nock to slip or fall off when you draw your bowstring.

, Fletching is the process of adding small fins, or ""vanes,"" to the back end of the arrow to ensure it flies straighter. You may fletch your arrows with feathers or another lightweight material. However, you may find it easier simply to buy modern plastic vanes, which are cheap and effective. Use thin lines of archery glue to secure these ahead of the nock.


Fletching is much easier with an apparatus called a ""fletching jig."" These allow you to securely and accurately add your feathers or vanes and ensure that your spacing is perfectly even. Fletching jigs are available for less than $100.

, Allow any glue to dry - your arrow may need to dry for several hours, depending on whether your tip, nock, and fletching were attached with glue or not. When your arrow is finished drying, or if you constructed an arrow entirely from screw-in parts, you can consider customizing it. You may want to mark it with paint or a permanent marker to make it easier to retrieve or to give it a distinct appearance. If you used a wooden shaft, you may want to finish the wood to protect it from the elements and to give it a more pleasing appearance. When your arrow is just how you like it, you're ready to add it to your quiver!


As always, make sure never to fire your arrow at people or animals (unless you're on a legal hunting trip). Modern commercial arrow points are deadly sharp - an accident can result in serious injury or death.

¼"" plate steel
¾"" heavy gauge metal pipe
Cutting goggles
Fire extinguisher
Hacksaw
Heavy insulated gloves
Plasma cutting torch/cutting laser (or other steel cutting tool)
Pipe (for handle)
Striker (for lighting torch)
Welding Equipment
File or grinding wheel, To cut steel you will need an appropriate metal cutting torch or access to a mild steel cutting laser.If you do not feel comfortable operating a high temperature steel-cutting torch, you should ask your local hardware store about places you might take mild-steel for fabrication., You don't want any flammable materials around if you intend on using a plasma torch to cut your tomahawk head. Bare earth or concrete will reduce the possibilities of a spark from your torch causing a fire. Working on a steel table that's a comfortable height for you is recommended.Be wary if your table or anything else has a coating. These can sometimes be highly flammable, and the fumes can be toxic.

, Draw the desired shape of your tomahawk head on your steel plate. To do this, you can either use a soapstone or permanent marker., You will need to hook up the appropriate tanks and gauges, turn off the necessary regulators, put on your gloves, and light your torch with your striker.If you haven't performed this process in a while, you may want to revisit how to use a cutting torch, or instead of using a plasma torch, find a facility nearby that has a laser cutter you can use to fashion your tomahawk., Make sure your plate is affixed to your table with clamps and be mindful of these while using your torch. Do not use clamps that are unable to withstand a considerable degree of heat, as these may melt. Arrange your plate at your workstation so that in cutting you will not damage the surface on which your plate rests., Both sides should be beveled, and the point sharp. You should use your file or grinding wheel to accomplish this task., Take your metal pipe and cut it down to size with an appropriate metal cutting saw, like a hack saw. The ideal length for your tomahawk will be between 16"" and 21"" depending on your preference and body type.You should start with a longer handle and give it a try before cutting it down to size. You can always remove more of your handle once you have discovered it is longer than is comfortable.

, You will need proper safety gear, like a welding jacket, welding helmet, and a welding gloves. If you only require a welding refresher, check out how to weld.

Once your equipment is prepared and your safety equipment put on, light your torch and weld your ax-head to your pipe handle.

, The metal cutting and welding process isn't always clean. You may have residual burrs or slag left over from making or attaching your ax-head. Using your file or grinding wheel, smooth any irregularities or deformities in the metal of your tomahawk., If may want to add an identifying feature to your tomahawk to make it more personalized, now is the time. You should also think about adding a wrap to your tomahawk handle to give it additional grip."

While looking for a stone, you will want one that is slightly thicker than that of your handle and mostly flat, without any jagged edges or cracks.The stone and handle will be notched later so that each fits together sturdily.

A suitable, sturdy wooden handle can be bought at your local hardware store. Just about any kind of wood can be used in this process, so long as the thickness of the handle is slightly larger in diameter than that of your stone., Depending on the kind of stone you are using, you may need to start polishing with a relatively coarse grade sandpaper. 60 grit is a good starting point.You can use finer grit sandpaper once the hard edges have been softened to give your tomahawk head a finished appearance.

, Your stone tomahawk head will attach to your handle by fitting into its slotted end.Using a hacksaw, cut one end of the handle of your tomahawk so that it is ¾ the diameter of your stone head of your ax., For the best possible fit for your tomahawk, you will want to make a corresponding notch to your handle in your stone. First you should make sure you are properly prepared to use your grinder, or other stone cutter, to notch your stone.Cutting stone can create a good amount of dust. You should wear a respirator or, at minimum, a mask to prevent from breathing in this dust.Have a container of cool water nearby. Grinding or cutting stone will create a good amount of heat. You should dunk your stone regularly in your container of water to keep it from overheating.
Eye protection is necessary in case a piece of rock or your fiber wheel breaks free during this process.Head protection, like a thick wool hat, can also provide ideal protection if a chipped piece of stone or equipment flies of your grinding wheel.

, It is advised that you work carefully and slowly while grinding or cutting your notch into your stone.Stone working tools are designed for this purpose and are exceptionally good at shaping stone, but careless use can result in severe injury. Depending on your grinder/cutter, there could be many configurations for use of this tool. Follow all directions as outlined in the manual, but, in principle:

Place your stone securely in the cutting area.
Make sure all safety catches are in place and guides are in place.
Clear all debris from the cutting area that you might get in your way.
Turn on your grinder/stone cutting tool.
Lower the blade to cut a notch in your stone ¼"" wide. The depth of your notch will have to be determined with regard to the slot you've made on your handle.
The total thickness of the notched part of your stone should be slightly larger than the slot you've made on your handle. "

Soak the wood handle in boiling water.,
Prepare to attach your ax-head and handle.,
Test your fit.,
Apply your epoxy.,
Affix your ax-head to your handle.,
Wrap your sinew around the head of your tomahawk.In a figure-eight pattern, wind your sinew very firmly around either side of your tomahawk handle and the top and bottom of your ax-head.,
Tie off your sinew.You may also want to apply a little bit of epoxy to your sinew to ensure it is firmly attached to your tomahawk.,
Wait for your epoxy to dry.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Make a Tomahawk4," Take the slotted end of your handle and put it in boiling water to soften the wood. This will make it easier to attach the head of your tomahawk.Test the softness of your wooden handle with your pliers. If the wood bends with relative ease, you should be able to mold it around your ax-head.

, Take your length of sinew and cut a length about 10"" to 12"" using your scissors. Using your pliers, carefully bend the slotted end of your handle outward to make room for your ax-head. Be sure your wood does not crack when doing this.

You should keep boiling water at the ready. Heat will go out of your wooden handle at a fairly quick rate. To maintain the flexibility of your wood, you will need to keep it hot.

, If the notch in your stone isn't deep enough or the slot in your handle is insufficient, you simply won't be able to fit your stone on your handle. Once the wood is soft, check to see if the head fits and make adjustments if you find it necessary.

Your stone ax-head should fit firmly into its slot and should require some amount of pressure before it pushes into place.

, This will help to hold your ax-head in place and make your tomahawk sturdier. Place some epoxy in the slot of your handle.You'll want to keep a rag close by soaked in a solvent, like alcohol, so that any excess or errant epoxy can be cleaned before it discolors your tomahawk., Now you should be able to slide the notch of your stone into the slot of your handle. This might take some effort on your part.Be firm, but don't exert so much pressure that you crack the handle.

Once the stone is in place, bend the ends of your slotted wood back inward to snugly hold your stone ax-head in place.
Wipe any epoxy on the visible parts of your stone or handle with your solvent soaked rag.

, Your sinew should cross in an X shape on the flat sides of your stone., After you have wound the ax-head and handle sufficiently in a figure-eight patter, wind the remaining sinew around the base of the ax-head, and tie it off with a sturdy knot of your choice., While waiting, you can begin cleaning up, but you should also take a moment to look over your tomahawk. If you notice any dripped epoxy, wipe it clean with your solvent soaked rag., Now that your tomahawk has finished drying, feel free to add any personal touches. You may want to add feathers or beads, or maybe even draw designs on the head of your tomahawk."

Get two square pieces of paper, preferably black construction paper.,
Holding the smaller square, fold one corner to the opposite side.,
Fold a crease halfway through the paper.,
Unfold the paper.,
Take one of the short sides of the triangle (not the long one) and fold the edge to the middle.,
Keep folding repeatedly until you can't fold it anymore.,
Squish the paper from top to bottom so that it creates a kunai shape (grasp by edges and press).,
Take the larger square paper and roll it into a thin tube for the handle.,
Insert the tube into the hole.,
Wrap your hand around the section of the tube next to the blade.,
Use a series of folds and reverse folds on the flat side of the tube to create a circle.,
Tape the circle so that it stays.,
Tape or staple the tube into the back of the kunai (where the hole is).,
Take something heavy and put it inside the knife so that it can fly better.,
Seal the kunai with thick tape so that the heavy object doesn't come flying out when you throw it.,
Finished.",How to Make a Paper Kunai Knife," One should be bigger than the other, to be used for the handle. This can be found at any craft store.









Gather the rest of your materials. These include some tape, scissors (to cut the paper into squares), and, optionally, a small, heavy object, like a penny.;
, It should now look like a triangle.








, It should now look like a smaller triangle.








, Now, it's a triangle with a crease.








, The edge of the side you're folding should line up with the crease. Flatten the fold down.








, Then tuck the extra paper inside the kunai.








, This step isn't that necessary. It just makes a flatter kunai.








, Tape it.








, You may need to open  the blade a bit to allow the tube to fit.








, Make sure there's enough of the tube that you can hold it. The extra bit, sticking out from your hand, should be flattened.









Optionally, before flattening the extra length of the tube, cut a chopstick to the length of the handle and stick it inside to improve the stiffness of the handle.

, You'll be making 90 degree folds in the flattened tube, in a counter-clockwise fashion.








, One piece of tape connecting the end of the tube to the unflattened section should do it.








, Make sure the handle is secure. Use extra tape here if necessary.








, Pennies work well and are cheap. This step is optional.








, Place tape over where the blade and handle meet, enough of it to seal and secure the heavy object in the blade.








, You've now got your very own paper kunai knife. Avoid throwing it at people as you could injure someone.

Buy or make a wooden stave.,
Gather your tools.,
Mark the outline.,
Test your stave.,
Form the limbs.",How to Make a Recurve Bow1," This is what your bow will be shaped from. It needs to be at the length that you want your bow to be, and it should be made from a wood that is strong, flexible, and malleable.


Hickory, yew, lemonwood, and maple are all good woods to use when making a bow.;
, A hatchet, vice grip, bow shaping frame, tillering stick, large file, heat gun, a few screw clamps, and a draw knife will make the process far easier than just using a knife and a large, round object.

, Make an outline of the limbs and arrow rest of your bow with a pen. Stand the stave up in one hand, and with the other, swing your hatchet. Make the stave as smooth on the sides as you can.


You can decide the specifics (flat limbs, wide or narrow limbs) on your own. Mark out where you want your handle to be.

, Make sure it will bend by putting the bottom tip against your instep, holding the upper tip with one hand, and pulling the back (side facing away from you while shooting) towards you. Don't do this too much, as it could damage your stave.

, After you have gotten your bow into an outline with the hatchet, you shape the limbs. Place the handle section of your stave in the vice, and tighten it. Make sure the back is facing upwards. Take the draw knife, and draw it along the stave in long strokes. Do this until your stave is at the thickness that you want your bow to be.


Sand down any rough edges in the stave.
Making your bow too thin will cause it to break.

Tape the head in place.,
Reinforce the tomahawk.,
Throw the tomahawk.",How to Make a Paper Tomahawk," For all parts of the design, you want the tomahawk to have some heft, especially if you plan to throw it at targets. For this reason, construction paper or even a fairly flexible cardstock will work best, but you can use plain 8.5”x11” printer paper if you use two or even three sheets of paper.;
, Line the sheets up perfectly even and roll them into a tube. You want to roll along the 8.5” axis so that the tube is still 11” long.The diameter of the tube should be fairly small, so roll it tight. The diameter shouldn’t be more than about 1/2” to 3/4”.

, Place three small pieces of tape along the edge of the tube to hold it together. One piece in the middle and one along each end will work fine for now. You don’t have to get fancy with the tape either. Scotch tape will do.

, Since the paper design doesn’t have the weight and heft to rotate end over end very well when you throw it, you can flatten the handle to help make the shape a bit more aerodynamic. Simply set the tube down flat on your work surface, squish it down, and crease the flattened shape.

, With a pair of scissors, take one end of the flattened handle and cut a 1” slit down the crease where you flattened it. The two slits should be exactly across from one another in a straight line that is parallel to the flat side of the handle., As with the handle, construction paper or flexible cardstock will work best, but you can still use regular 8.5”x11” printer paper if you use two or three sheets of it.

, Line up the sheets of paper so they are flush with one another and fold them in half along the 11” axis.This means that after the fold, the 8.5” side will still be 8.5” long.


Many younger students may be familiar with calling this folding it the “hamburger” way instead of the “hot dog” way.

, Make sure that the pages are still perfectly aligned and fold it in half again. This time fold along the opposite axis—the side that’s still 8.5”.After these two folds, the pages should form a rectangle approximately 4.25”x5.5”.

, Now you want to fold the paper one final time along the same axis as the first fold—the one that is approximately 5.5” after the second fold.This last fold will be a bit more difficult to make since the paper will have gotten pretty thick. By making the head of the tomahawk dense like this, it will have more heft to rotate when you throw it.


The final product will be roughly 2.75”x4.25”. Probably a hair less since the folds themselves take up some of the length of the paper.

, In order to stop the paper from unfolding, place more of the Scotch or packing tape over the edges of the paper on the three open sides., This part is completely optional, but if you want to give your tomahawk head a more authentic shape, then you can begin by drawing the shape onto the currently rectangular head.While you can get as creative as you want, the general tomahawk shape is a teardrop shape or like that of an elongated baseball diamond—meaning one rounded side and one that comes to a triangular point.


Use as much of the current rectangle as possible. You don’t want to trim too much of the paper away when cutting the shape.

, With your desired tomahawk shape drawn onto the rectangular head, you can simply cut around the template. It may take a bit of work to cut through the thickness of the folded paper, but a decent pair of scissors can still do it.


You can discard the excess.

, Since you will most likely trim away some of the taped portion when you cut out your design, you will need to add another round of tape around the edges of the head. Make sure that the paper is perfectly aligned before taping it.

, With both the handle and head of the tomahawk complete, you can put the pieces together. Start by sliding the head of the tomahawk into the 1” slit you made in one end of the handle.The placement should leave the majority of the larger, rounded edge protruding from one side of the handle with only about 3/4” of the triangular point protruding from the other side.
If you chose not to cut out a design and you’re still using the full rectangular head, then it’s important to make sure about 80% of the head is off to one side of the handle. If the head is too balanced in the handle, then the tomahawk will not rotate correctly when you throw it.

, With the head of the tomahawk properly set in the handle, you can tape it in place.Tape around each part of the groove with a liberal amount of tape. You want to make sure that the head of the tomahawk doesn’t jiggle in the handle at all.

, Since the design is just paper, throwing the tomahawk will pretty quickly lead to wear and tear on it. If you have some duct tape handy, you can easily reinforce the tomahawk by wrapping the head and connection to the handle., Now that you’ve made your tomahawk, you should get some practice throwing it. Set up some targets—away from anything fragile—and throw the tomahawk at them by gripping the handle, lining up your aim with the target, and throwing the tomahawk with some spin to it. It should rotate end over end toward the target.


The rotating motion actually stabilizes the tomahawk’s path the same way rifling on a gun barrel spins a bullet to stabilize it’s trajectory!

Type everything up and print it out as a book.",How to Make Your Own Fantasy World," Start by imagining what basic kind of world you are envisioning, and what their lives must be like. This will help you shape the ""feeling"" of your world.


Is it a peaceful world, without wars, anger, or violence? Or is it a world that's falling apart at the seams, with crime, mayhem, and battles?
Knowing that, you can start describing your inhabitants. Create them, write their histories, cultures, ways of living, weapons, food, education, governments, transport, anything. Are there multiple races, like fish lizards and sentient octopods wandering around? What conflicts occur between different races?
Define the extent of the culture. It can be a single dominant culture, like the Klingon Empire, or it can be a number of different cultures, with different customs, like Earth.;
, You can change it later, if you like, but it's good to start somewhere. One way to do it is to use your own name as a basis.


For example, Lilithopia has a nice sound to it, especially if it's a pretty world, filled with flowers. Zachtopia, maybe not so much! But if you dropped the ""...topia"" bit, and called it ""Zakchan,"" or even just ""Zakh,"" you have a good start.
You could just say some random cool sounding thing. (Kaiu, Mikvar, etc.) Maybe even a play on words. (Guess what a Catacloyapa would be like).
Names of cities in foreign countries can be used well. For example, Ravonik or Turan, from Albania.
Make the name of your world reflect the inhabitants. For example, if it's a warlike world, calling your planet ""Bliss"" might not be so good. On the other hand, if your world is populated by unicorns and elves, calling it ""Kzrakh"" would not work at all.
Create different countries! Design flags for each country, give it a unique name, and create the culture and customs that are both unique to them, and common to all the cultures of your world.

, Decide what the landscape of your world is like. Where are the deserts? Where are the mountains? The forests?


Think about how much of the world is covered in the various environments. For example, it could be a desert planet, an ice asteroid belt, or forest moon. Or it could be more temperate, like our earth, but with different creatures and plants.

, You can use a lot of wildlife from Earth, but if you're feeling adventurous, make them all up! Are they vertebrates (have a spine)? Invertebrates (don't have a spine)? Teeth, fangs, claws, scales, fur, wings, eyes, limbs and slime are some of the many things you can stick on them.


Check out books about unusual bugs, and deep-water sea life. Those are some of the most unusual-looking creatures in the world—like aliens in our own back yard!
What kind of animals do your inhabitants ride? Figure out what the animal eats, and then figure out what eats the animals!
Building the ecosystem (what eats what, what's the top predator, how everything lives together) is a good way to learn more about the world you're creating. Where in your world do all these creatures live? They can live in the sky, or under the lava beds. Maybe they're ice worms that burrow through solid methane, or energy beings that can be both solid and light at the same time.

, Once you start getting an idea who your inhabitants are, and what they do, it's time to give them a past.


Describe how they evolved from another life form or were created by god(s).
Who or what created gave rise to the life on planet Xyxyx? What major events have changed the course of the world?
Are there gods and/or goddesses, has evolution shaped things, or is it a combination of the two? Describe what your planet's cultures have done during their history. Have there been wars (civil, international)? Strife? Anarchies? Rebellions? Have they actually been quite peaceful?

, This is often a touchy topic for those who are incredibly faithful to their real-world religion. Just remember that you still believe in your deity, and that you are not transferring your faith in any way. Just like writing a murder mystery doesn't turn you into a murderer, so will writing about other gods not turn you into a heathen.


Is the dominant religion polytheistic (many gods), monotheistic (one god), pantheistic (everything is god), monistic (no god, only a holy energy), or atheistic (no gods)? You get to define if they look like the inhabitants only a lot bigger and purple, or like little chipmunks with fangs. The field's wide open.
Are the gods animals? Does each have a specific power? Do they have one spouse or multiple spouses? Do these gods exist, or are they made up? Did anything predate these gods?

, Do they speak English? French? Spanish? Or a completely new language? Remember, if you're planning to write a book from this, which you might be, don't create a new language and have your characters use it all the way through. Most will throw the book down in disgust, not being able to understand without constant reference.


To see how this was accomplished by a master, read Lord of the Rings. Tolkien created complete languages so the characters would have a ""history,"" but he only used their language sparingly, for important things. It gives his world an air of authenticity that it might have otherwise lacked.

, What are the myths of each country? Create bedtime stories to scare children, make up fairy tales, and imagine legends with ""more than a grain of truth in them,"" or major prophecies (such as the Mayan Calendar prophecy!)

, What games do children play? Which countries are poor? Which ones are rich? Is it hard work or is there plenty of time for play?

, First, draw in land masses, like continents, and large bodies of water or other geographic features (if any) that your world possesses.


Add technical boundaries. Much like Europe and Asia, they are separate continents whose boundaries are defined by nature.
Add political boundaries: these are countries, states, and cities. Take a look at Google Maps to see how these things are handled, and use that as a guide.

, Once you have the borders of your country defined, start adding names. Work your way down from big to small, as the there will be few large features, and many small.


Name your major features first: continents, oceans, deserts, forests, etc.
Give each country a capital city. Locate and name major cities, then the names of countries, provinces, continents, oceans, deserts, forests, etc.
This may seem overwhelming, but just relax and don't think about anything, just let the ideas flow. There's no rush. You can put it all in an imaginary box in your mind, or write notes down on paper.
Search for ""random fantasy name generator"" on Google if you can't think of as many as you need.

, Exclude small islands to begin with. Make sure to make the borders of the landmasses are jagged (like coastlines), not smooth and curvy (unless you have a very good, in-your-world reason for doing this, not just because you're lazy).


It helps to use a computer because it is easier to edit than on paper.
Add the small islands. Remember, these islands can be made to be very important, economically and strategically.

, Use simple symbols like triangles for mountains and dots for cities (unless you're a bit of an artist, and you like drawing the mountains beautifully and drawing tiny little houses and castles for the cities).


Then fill in the place names. Be sure to make continent names in a larger size than country names, country names larger than city names, etc.
Don't forget to adjust the size of your city symbols and make a different symbol for capitals, countries and provinces.

, This can be done any way you want, tweak it slightly, and voila! You have your map.

, To do this you want the nearby countries to be grey or sepia-colored. Then color each province a different bright color. Of course, if no countries exist (i.e you have a very early world, or one ravaged by war, or a peaceful, John-Lennon-Imagine kind of place), then you don't have to do this step.

, You can write the introduction as if you were a professor studying this, and write the rest as if it were nonfiction. Publish your information on the Internet if you wish for everyone to see.


Study anthropological writings about indigenous peoples, plants, or animals, to see how they describe them. Or check out how National Geographic writes about discoveries. Adapt that style to your own descriptions.

1 Rubber Band
1 Sheet of Paper
Scissors or Ruler (Optional);
, Take your piece of paper. Cut or tear the piece of paper into smaller pieces with your hands, scissors, ruler, etc. The small papers should be roughly near 7 cm by 1 cm. Scrunch up the small pieces of paper into a good-sized, tight and firm paper ball. This will be called a mini-paper bullet. Make a few more bullets to add to your ammo stock.

In school, you might shoot your bullets across the room but you should hide your weapon so that people aren't suspicious of you. You certainly don't want your enemy or other people using your weapon. The best hiding spot for your bullets is your pocket. Shorts pocket, jacket pocket, all are fine. Hiding it in a pocket is another good thing because your hand could reach it easily.

, Pretend to be writing or pretend to be doing something with your hands. The person you shot might think that your working hands means that it is too busy for games.

, The rubber band makes a twanging sound after firing the bullet so it is a good idea to hide it quickly. If you have a watch, you could use it to cover up your rubber band. Or else you put it inside a pocket or put it next to other bracelets or things on your arm to make it look like everyday stuff.

You might not get it to shoot well at first, but remember to place the bullet in the right place so the power will go into the bullet. Don't forget to read the tips below to learn more

Acquire a branch and/or pole.,
Carve a pointed tip for your spear.,
Build a small fire to “bake” the point of your spear.",How to Make a Spear1," When searching for a pole to make your spear, you’ll want something at least as tall as you. Ideally it would be a few inches taller in order to give you a better reach.The pole you choose should be anywhere from 1–1.5 inches (2.5–3.8 cm) in diameter.Hardwoods, such as ash or oak, are best for this project. To sharpen your spear, find some sort of rough surface such as stone, or a brick wall/ sidewalk. Rub it against the surface and sharpen it well.If you are making a spear in the wilderness, search surrounding areas for a sapling of the right size. You can choose to use live wood or a recently deceased tree, whatever is available.;
, Using a knife or a small hand-axe, carefully fashion a point on one end of your pole or branch.


Form the point by using small, even strokes and always cut away from yourself to avoid injury.
This can be quite a time consuming task. Even with a sharp knife, cutting away at wood can be dangerous and physically taxing.

, Once you are satisfied with the point of your spear, hold the sharpened end just above the flames, turning until you see the wood change color. Continue turning over the fire until the entire point is completely “baked.”Fire hardening is simply drying the wood out to make it lighter and harder. Moist wood is soft, dry wood is hard. By holding the spear tip over the flames, you are simply removing all moisture from the wood."

Use the screw clamps to secure the stave to the frame.
If you have trouble, use the heat gun to heat up the stave, and then secure that section to the frame.

, Both limbs should be as close to equally bent as possible. In order to ensure this, make sure that you are bending the stave at equal distances from both ends of the handle.

, Try to leave each section secured in the frame for at least a few hours, ideally overnight. This will give the wood time to set in the new position, and will make for a longer-lasting and more effective bow.

Cut notches for the string.,
Tiller the bow.,
Place the bow on a tillering stick.,
String the bow.,
Finish the bow.",How to Make a Recurve Bow3," Put notches into the top and bottom of the limbs. These are what holds the bowstring in place. It's best if you do this with a long, cylindrical file, but it can be done with a knife and a flat, narrow file.


Cut the notches on the inside of the bow to protect the integrity of the outside wood.

, Tillering is what gives your bow its draw. Once you have gotten your bow to the shape you want it to be, place a tillering string on it. The tillering string should be about twice as long as the intended bow string. Tie a loop in each end of the string and attach it to the notches on the limbs.


Parachute cord works well as a tillering string.

, Pull the tillering string to one of the notches closer to the top of the stick. Slowly and gradually pull the bow further, taking note of how the bow is bending.


The tillering process takes a long time, and is very gradual.
If you hear noise coming from the bow, stop, and use the large file to shape the limbs a little more.
The tillering process can take months, and doing it slowly will allow you to increase the draw of the bow to a good length.
Once your tillering process is started, you can smooth off the front of the bow with the large file.

, Once the bow has reached an acceptable draw, remove it from the tillering stick and take off the tillering string. Attach the bowstring. Loop both ends around the notches.


Nylon is a very popular bowstring.
The bow can be strung and fired during the tillering process, although it may not be at full strength, and firing might hinder the success of the tillering process.

, Once you have completed the tillering process, you can add artwork, leather, or a protective coating to your bow.

Find an appropriately sized limb or sapling.,
Clean the limb.,
Create a “shelf” for the knife.,
Attach the knife.",How to Make a Spear2," When making a knife spear, you want to find a handle that will be easy to cut into but sturdy enough to use as a weapon or tool. Avoid using green wood. Recently deceased trees are ideal.Search for a limb that is roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.

, Trim any branches or knobs off the chosen limb and make a clean handle. You may choose to remove some of the bark in order to make the handle easier to grip., Choose which end of the branch you will be attaching the knife to. Using a sharp knife, cut long, thin, vertical strips off the branch until you are left with a shelf for the knife.Creating a shelf lends support to your spear and will aid in securing the knife to the handle.Brace the branch against another tree or stump to make this process safer and easier., Use a length of rope or other available cordage to secure the knife to the branch. Tie one end of the rope to a tree trunk and wrap the other end around the knife and branch. Walk away until the line is taught. Then, using your body weight to keep the line taught, begin wrapping the rope around your knife.Wrap the rope all the way up to the hilt of the knife. For extra security make another pass back down the handle. Finish the wrap with a simple knot."

Purchase a spearhead.,
Find a suitable haft.,
Check the fit of the spearhead.,
Attach the spearhead.",How to Make a Spear3," Spearheads can be purchased from numerous blade-smiths online. It may also be possible to purchase a spearhead from a local knife shop if your city has one.


Purchased spearheads may not come pre-sharpened. You could sharpen the blade yourself if you like, or take it to a professional knife sharpener.

, The “haft” of a spear is simply the pole to which the spearhead is attached. “Hafting,” is the act of attaching a spearhead to a handle.


If you spent money on a nice spearhead, chances are you’ll want to shell out the extra money for a decent ash pole.
Depending on the thickness of the haft, you may have to taper one end in order to properly secure the spearhead. Make sure you only carve enough to fit the spearhead; carve too much and you will have a gap between the haft and the spearhead resulting in a loose fit., Put the spearhead on the haft making sure the fit is snug. Your spearhead may come with holes in the “socket,” the hollowed end that fits over the haft.Using a marker or pencil, mark on the haft where the holes fall. You will be drilling a small hole here to secure the spearhead.

, You can secure the spearhead with a short nail or a pin. Alternatively, you may simply use glue or epoxy if you do not have access to a drill.


If there are multiple holes in the spearhead socket, make sure you drill straight through the haft, otherwise the pin or nail will be out of alignment with the socket holes.Drive a short nail through the holes securing the spearhead to the haft. Secure one end of the nail using either a pair of pliers or a vice. This is to stabilize the spear while you hammer the other end of the nail.Using a ball-peen hammer, tap around the head of the nail until it flattens out, causing a rivet and locking the nail in place. Repeat this process on the opposite side until both ends of the nail are securely fastened."

Stay positive.,
Believe in yourself.,
Decide on a concrete goal.,
Prioritize your dream.,
Be open to compromise.,
Be persistent.",How to Make Your Impossible Wishes Come True1," Don't dwell on the negative aspects of life. Instead, be mindful about the good things and think about tomorrow's opportunities. This bit of common self-help advice is actually supported by science. Positive thinking makes us more successful, happier, and can even improve our health.At the same time, be careful not to blame yourself for having ""negative thoughts"" or for things that are outside your control. Mental illnesses like depression make positive thinking difficult. Additionally, while staying positive can spur you into action, thoughts alone do not change reality.;
, Build your self-confidence with daily affirmations. You will need to rely on yourself to make your wishes come true. When you don't believe you can achieve your goals, you're making a self-fulfilling prophecy. Turn that around and you'll be more likely to succeed., Figure out exactly what you want to wish for and state it in concrete terms. You won't be able to achieve your goals if you don't know what they are.


Is your dream to be famous? Decide what you want to be famous for. If you want to be a famous actor, take an improv class or try out for the school play. If you want to be a rock star, learn guitar and start a band.
Do you want to find love? Think about what kind of relationship you're looking for. Consider who your ideal partner may be. Know what you want to avoid missing out if he or she finds you.

, Don't let yourself get distracted by instant gratification. If something seems appealing right now but actually puts your wish further out of reach, don't do it.


For example, if your goal is financial independence and you come across a really great deal on a big-screen TV, consider: Will a cheap TV help you become financially independent? Or will putting that amount of money into an interest-bearing savings account instead be more in line with your goal? In a year, your cheap TV will be worth significantly less than what you paid for it, while that savings account would accrue interest.

, While it's fine to go for the improbable (like being famous), remember that truly impossible wishes really are unattainable. Instead, try turning fantastic goals into realistic ones.


Do you want to be a mermaid? Think about what aspects of being a mermaid you like the most. Instead of a literal mermaid, think about becoming a world-class swimmer or a respected marine biologist.
Do you want to fly like a superhero? Start studying for your pilot's license or join your country's air force.

, Whatever your goal, whether lofty or simple, there will probably be setbacks and difficulties along the way. Recognize temporary setbacks for what they are and learn how to move past them.


Did your actions (or inaction) cause that setback? Don't beat yourself up. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Learn from them and modify your strategy for next time.
Did things not work out due to sheer luck and coincidence? If so, there's no reason why you shouldn't try again.
If along the way you find that your goal isn't practically obtainable, consider revising your original wish and think of an alternative.

Stop procrastinating.,
Do your homework.,
Create an outline for yourself.,
Take that first step.,
Keep track of your progress.",How to Make Your Impossible Wishes Come True2," Procrastination tricks you into inaction and sabotages your success.Don't keep waiting for the right moment to start working towards your wish. The ""right moment"" doesn't really exist. The right moment won't come when you have enough money. The right moment won't come when you have enough skill. The right moment won't come when you get someone else's approval. The right moment is now. The sooner you start working, the sooner your wish will come true.

, Search the Internet for information about what you need to do to make your wish come true. This website is a great resource. Simply type what your wish is into the search bar to look for help.


For example, if you want to be an animator, you'll need to learn to draw and build a portfolio. Using the web, look for programs that have trained successful animators and that have internship programs with major animation companies. You can find specific application requirements through a program's website.

, Make a list of everything you'll need to do to achieve your goal as a loose timeline. You should be very detailed about the initial steps, but later steps can be left vague.


For example, do you want to be an astronaut? If you're still in high school, your first step will be applying to an accredited college that offers bachelor's degrees in various scientific disciplines. Details for this step should include a list of schools, their admissions requirements, and any important deadlines. Jot down later steps that may change over time as simply ""pick a major"" and ""get my pilot's license"" without specifics.The key is to be creative and put yourself in a position to realize your dreams. While you may never become a best-selling author, you definitely won't be unless you start writing. Remember the proverb: ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."", No amount of preparation will make your wish come true unless you follow through. Make sure you stick to your outline and keep up with important deadlines. While your wish may involve some sort of waiting, you should fill that time by practicing your talent or educating yourself.

, During your journey towards fulfilling your wish, you should write down everything you do that puts you closer to achieving it. This will help you see your progress and help keep you motivated.


You can write your progress in a physical notebook or type it up on a computer. You may even choose to publish your progress online as a blog.
How often you update will depend on your goal. For instance, if you are a college student who wishes to be a neurosurgeon, you may choose to update weekly or monthly. You can write about what you've done during that time period that will help you get into medical school, such as ""volunteered for 20 hours at a clinic"" or ""aced an exam."" In contrast, if you're trying to get in shape, consider writing about your daily exercise routine. Just be sure to set a regular update schedule to help keep you on the right track.
Write about both your successes and setbacks. Being mindful of your achievements will help you to stay positive, while writing out what you still need to work on will help you plan for your next step.

"
Talk to other people about your wish.,
Be selective about whose advice you choose to take.,
Consider posting your wish to social media and/or crowdsourcing platforms.",How to Make Your Impossible Wishes Come True3," While your family, friends, and business associates may not share the same wishes, they can be valuable resources. Talk to them and share your dreams and your ideas on how to accomplish them. They may have helpful ideas of their own. You may even find like-minded individuals to collaborate with on your dream project.


When you open up to others, be prepared to listen honestly to what they have to say. It will not always be what you want to hear, but an alternate point of view can be invaluable.
If you need money to achieve your dream, other people are an important resource. Whether it's your parents helping with college application fees or investors giving you startup capital for your company, you'll need to learn how to ask for help.

, While some people may help make your wish come true, others will try to shoot you down. Still others may derail you with bad advice, whether on purpose or unintentionally. While your decisions may come down to instinct, there are a few things to keep in mind:


Think about where the advice is coming from. What is his or her background? Does the person giving it have experience in something related to your wish? Is this person happy and successful? Remember that even people who seem knowledgeable may be outdated or uniformed. Worse, an apparently helpful individual may want you to fail due to his or her own shortcomings.
Always check ""facts"" when you can, especially ones that seem outlandish. Listen to as many opinions about a topic as possible. If you can't verify a claim, it's unlikely to be true.Learn to tell the difference between naysayers and realists. A naysayer may tell you that wanting to direct a blockbuster movie is a ridiculous goal. In contrast, a realistic critic may tell you that you probably won't become a famous director but may offer tips on choosing a film school., For certain wishes, there may be very little you can personally do to make them happen. On the other hand, there are plenty of wealthy or well-connected people in the world who perform random acts of kindness. If you have an interesting wish and a story to tell, try posting about it on social media. Crowdsourcing for ""impossible"" wishes is also becoming more popular, connecting people to others who can grant them. You never know who may read your story and want to help you."
"
Try spiritual methods consistent with your beliefs.,
Turn to your culture's folk superstitions.,
Post on wishing websites and applications.",How to Make Your Impossible Wishes Come True4," There is very little you can personally do to make some wishes come true. For those types of wishes, you may decide to turn to supernatural methods in an effort to make them come true. Exactly what you should do in these situations will depend on your religion.


If you believe in one or more deities or other spiritual beings that will sometimes make wishes come true, try prayer. How you do this will vary based on your faith. If you're unsure, try talking to a local spiritual leader.
Some religions use specific magical rituals called spells to make wishes come true. In some spiritual practices, spells channel the caster's own power while in others spells are cast to ask a higher power to intercede on the caster's behalf.A currently popular New Age philosophy called the Law of Attraction asserts that people shape reality through their thoughts. If you believe this, focus your thoughts on your wish to make it happen., There are many fun, supposedly wish-granting traditions that people engage in every day. Since they typically don't require much more effort than a simple thought, there's no harm in trying them. Some examples include:


Silently make a wish when blowing out the candles on your birthday cake.
If you see a shooting star, make a wish.
When you notice the time line up on a clock, for example at 11:11 or 03:33, say your wish to yourself., There are many websites that take traditional wishing into the Digital Age. These sites typically instruct you to type your wish into a textbox for it to come true. Depending on the site, your wish may be posted publically or kept private.


Be very careful not to reveal personal information when typing your wish, especially if you're a minor. Never include your phone number, name, address, or location. You never know who may be reading.

You could have an unlocking system, where certain worlds, missions/goals and items are locked until you finish a smaller mission or goal in the whole sequence.
You could also have a leveling up system, where after you complete missions/goals or battle (if you're into that) a certain number of times, you level up. This could also add to the unlocking system, level up and unlock a certain item or world.
Another option is to have battles in order to complete something.
You could also have to earn coins/money to buy items. If you want, you could add this to the unlocking system. You unlock something and you can buy it.

, This could be a side goal- or an obstacle that's keeping you from accomplishing your goals.


It helps if you have someone else battle you. If no one else will play, imagine your enemy. If you use sticks and battle another person, try not to hit too hard and cause injury.
Sometimes it's good not to win every time, especially when battling an imaginary foe. See what happens when you lose a battle!

The ability to control your dreams is known as lucid dreaming, and it is possible., Say that you want to dream you're in a meadow, a beautiful meadow that you added earlier to your dreamscape. Tall grass grows lush and high, and when the sun trickles through the blades like warm honey, they ignite and turn a brilliant shade of green. A warm wind sweeps through, soft and deliciously sweet. In your hand you hold a book, a thick, rich, delicious book with a sturdy cover just barely managing to behold the magic that lies within. You feel so happy you feel as though your heart is swooping about, fluttering in your rib cage. Birds perch in the tall trees surrounding you and serenade you with glorious music. You lie down in the sweet grass, feeling so happy, so deliriously drowsy..., At work, in the bathroom, all throughout the day. Continue to do so until bedtime.

You may even verbalize it and whisper to yourself, ""I will sleep peacefully in a sweet, sunny meadow,"" to better promote the image.

, Chances are you will then dream about it., Think all day about one person, dream about them that night, then add them to the meadow the next day. The people may even develop personalities of their own in your dreams!

, If you forget about your made-up land for a while, or just don't think about it, it may disappear or change. Think about it a lot, but don't get distracted; try to keep it on the weekends or at bedtime. Most of all, have it in your head like you would keep an ace in your hand; whip it our when you need it most. When you truly need an escape, take a free vacation to the land (literally) of your dreams.

Start a new settlement, or make sure you have around as many starting materials as a new settlement gets.,
Realize that Farms and Latifundia are key at the beginning.,
Harvest on your Farms.,
Use Hemp produced by the farm to build a Quarry.,
Use produce from the farms can build more Latifundia, which house more peers to run more buildings.,
Build Cottages and Houses (in the fields at first, or Residential district if you've built one).,
Use Sandstone from the Quarry to construct a Brickmaker as soon as possible.,
Use Produce from the Farms to build a Grocer.,
Build a Town Square.,
Build a forum.,
Manage your Settlement smartly.",How to Get a Settlement to Rank 3 in Brunelleschi: Age of Architects," If you've already built things or used up resources, you might have a harder time getting to Rank 3 (Community) than you would with a new start.


Your Settlement can't be higher rank than its Sovereign. Since that's you, you need to focus on raising Importance to make your settlement grow. You'll need to level up, do Important actions, and get as many Upvotes as you can on the forums to keep advancing.;
, Latifundia let you have more Peers, which are the highest ranking class of NPC citizen. They're hard to keep happy, so watch out for the Security, Healthy, Education, Faith, and Prosperity of the District slipping as you build them. You can get some nasty AP penalties from the negative Scenarios that will spawn if you let any of those numbers slip below 40%.

, Farms can Harvest 5 different things; you'll really only need Grain, Hemp, and Produce to start with. Grain will build more Farms and upgrade your Granary. The Granary brings in a lot of population so upgrade it as quickly as possible. You and your Ministers / Citizens can Harvest the same resources as the Farm with your AP so try that as a way to speed up settlement growth.

, You'll have to build the first one in your fields, but it's OK, you can tear it down later and get some Hemp back. Once you build a Quarry, you may have to shut down the production in some of your farms to free up population for the Quarry. Remember to switch the quarry to sandstone for now. You may want to build another Quarry quickly to also harvest Marble, you'll need it for your Town Square.

, It's a bit of a cycle, and you'll get used to the way it works pretty quickly.

, This will bring more peasants and yeomen into the settlement. Keep watching your Happiness ratings, things will get more complicated once your populace begins to become unhappy.

, The brickmaker will use up more Population, but will also Turn Sandstone to Brick. This is probably your first Production Building, so keep in mind it will use up the production of 1 Level of Quarry worth of sandstone per cycle. It's easy to keep the numbers matched up... at first.

, Grocers are also a Production Building, and so they use up Produce to make Groceries.


Groceries can be used to build Cottages, Bricks make Houses, and Produce makes Latifundia. This basic setup will allow you to build up your initial population. Later you'll get more efficient housing buildings, but for now spread out. You have 27 Lots for buildings in your Fields, and it's always more expensive to build 'Up' (Higher Level Building), than to build 'Out' (More L1 Buildings).

, Once you have 1,000 importance and ~3,400 Marble, you're ready to build a Town Square!


The Town Square will upgrade your settlement to Rank 2 (Village) and allow you to build 4 new Districts. You might want to build some new districts and promote any ministers who've gotten to Rank 2 themselves, they're bound to appreciate it.

, You'll need 10 times as much importance to get to Rank 3, and ~2100 Bricks to build a Forum. The forum is the Main Building of your Marketplace, and building it will raise your Settlement to Rank 3 (Community). The Forum also produces 1 Silver Drachma per Yeoman living in the Marketplace per day, so you may want to build some houses or apartment buildings here.

, From this point you'll have to make lots of choices about your settlement, and you'll need help from competent Ministers. Your Marketplace will give you a new Action, 'Bargain Hunt' , which allows you to turn Silver Drachmas into Rank 1 Equipment. This will provide you plenty of gear to sell or donate to your Hero Citizens, who will in turn level up and accomplish more with the improved Attributes from the equipment. You're well on your way to becoming a powerful Lord!

Then 'roll' another number add it's attack and that's how much damage you get from the monster. Then keep going back and forth. When a Wizard or Archer attacks, get within 12 spaces between you and the enemy. Then roll and if you get enough spaces to where you could get on them, then you hit. Archers add their range # to that number. Next of course, roll for the attack. After that, roll for the monster, and it goes after you the number of spaces you rolled.

, To get experience points, defeat a monster and the number of its HP is how much you get. To level up, get enough EXP. to equal the number of your HP.

Give your creature a purpose.Thinking about the purpose of your mythological creature can help you to shape the development and look of your beast.,
Consider the personality traits of your creature.,
Assign your creature specific abilities.,
Name your creature by using ancient words.,
Create your own unique name for your creature.,
Think about the scale of your mythological creature.,
Consider texture and animal-like attributes.,
Decide on a color for your mythological creature.,
Create accessories for you mythological creature.,
Sketch your creature.This will help you to see your finished creature as you envisioned it.,
Add color to your sketch.,
Write about your mythological creature.,
Weave your mythological creature into a larger narrative.",How to Create Your Own Mythological Creature," This is especially important if you are creating a creature as a part of a game.


Will your creature be a background part of a fantastical environment you want to create, a mount for a hero figure, or a fighter? Many mythological creatures have specific vocations or relationships to other creatures in a universe.
Decide if you want your creature to be a companion to a creature that already exists.
Discover the role your want your new creature to play in your mythology.;
, In addition to specific purposes, many mythological creatures also share certain moral and personality traits within their species. Think about what you want your creature to be like.


Do you want your creature to be good or bad? Do you want it to be a singular, solitary beast, or do you want to create a legion of these creatures? For example, in the Lord of the Rings mythology, orcs were created as a dark, twisted mockery of elves and used in Sauron’s army in the book series.What will the intelligence level of your creature be? Do you want it to be a trickster or strong but simplistic? Do you want it to be always good or self-serving?

, Based on the role you want your mythological creature to play in your fantasy universe, you need to give them attributes that will help them in that role.It can help to write down a list of attributes, and then narrow down that list to those essential for your creature. Some possible supernatural abilities include:


Shape-shifting: the ability to change appearance at will
Superb strength: a supernatural level of brute strength
Flight: the ability to fly
Underwater breathing: the ability to swim and breathe underwater
Healing: the ability to heal wounds or sickness
Foreshadowing: the ability to foresee or predict future events
Climbing: the ability to scale walls or climb other tall structures without equipment

, To bring your creature into existence, you need to give it a name. Your name can be just a word that you like, or it can have a connection with your creature’s abilities or physical attributes.Consider using Latin or Greek in your name. Many fantastic creatures in mythology have Latin or Greek-based names. Using ancient language is a way to name your creature based on attributes without the name sounding silly.
For example, in Latin, the word “inpennatus” means feathered. So, if your creature can fly, you might name it Inpennatus, or a variation of the word, like Pennatus., If you don’t want to name your creature using Latin or Greek word roots, you can make up an entirely new word to use as a name.


One way to create a unique name for your creature is to make an anagram of one of its attributes.This simply means rearranging the letters of the word. For example, if your creature is a fighter, you might rearrange the letters in the word “fighter,” and call your creature a Rheftig.
If you find it difficult to come up with names of your own, try an online name generator. These can help you find unique mythological names quickly., The size of your creature is a large part of its overall look. Whether your creature is large or small will be largely based on how you want others to perceive the creature. It can also correlate to the attributes you chose for your creature.


For example, if you envision your creature to be a trickster or as being very sneaky, you might want to make it smaller in stature, like a leprechaun or an elf.
However, if your creature has an attribute like supernatural strength, you may want it to be large in size to show off this attribute.
You can also play around with these connections. For example, a small creature with super strength could be surprising and advantageous.

, Many mythological creatures take on aspects of multiple normal animals, and thus become a more formidable composite creature. For example, the majestic hippogriff has the front half of a gryphon and the back half of a horse.Centaurs have the upper body of a human and the lower body of a horse.Think about the traits of your creature. If your creature is strong and a fighter, consider giving it a physical trait from a strong creature like an eagle, snake, or alligator.
If your mythological creature has wings, decide what sort of wings you want them to be. Do you want feathered wings, bat-like wings, wings with scales, or insect wings?
Do you want your creature to have scales, smooth skin, fur, or feathers on its body?

, Once you have determined the body type of your creature, you want to assign it a coloring. This might be a singular color or multiple colors. This coloring might be glossy or matte.


Take the function of your creature into account. For example, if you want your creature to be camouflaged in its environment, you may want to give it a neutral color.
A vibrant coloring, on the other hand, can show off its attributes and make your creature stand out.
For example, the phoenix, also known as the firebird, has a bright orange and red coloring, which matches its name and abilities., As well as creating the look for your mythological creature, you can also add on to their overall abilities and look with accessories like clothing and weapons.


Consider armor. Will your creature’s armor be purely natural, like scales, or do you also want to create something for you creature to wear?
If you do want to accessorize your creature, think about what material and color you want these accessories to be.

, You can draw with a pencil on paper or sketch your creature digitally.Take your time when you sketch your creature. Sketch it from multiple different angles to show off its various physical traits.
On the paper where you sketch your creature, label the creature with its name.

, Color will bring life to your mythological creature. You can use it to add detail to your drawing. With color, you’ll be able to see your full vision for your creature drawn out on paper.


Use markers, crayons, or colored pencils for simple, mess-free color.
If you want to create a more complex type of artwork, try using paints. Oil, acrylic, and watercolor will all work for your project.

, Storytelling is an essential part of mythology and bringing your creation to life in your mythological world. Start by simply writing down all of your creature’s abilities.


Give you creature an origin story, or even multiple alternate origin stories. This is simply an account of where the creature originated.For example, by one account in Greek mythology, centaurs came into being when Ixion fell in love with the wife of Zeus, Hera. Ixion arranged to meet with Hera, but Zeus found out and formed a cloud into the shape of Hera. When Ixion embraced the cloud form, centaurs were made from the union.In addition to origin stories, you can also create stories of the journeys your creature has gone on, and the battles it has fought.

, You’ll have to decide whether you want to add your mythological creature to the lore of a world that already exists in a book, movie, or game, or create your own world.


Write about how your creature relates to others in the world you choose. Does it have specific allies or enemies?
Think about communication. What type of language does your creature have? What is its personality temperament?
You can write stories, lists, or create graphic style artwork to weave your creature into a larger mythology.

Fill in each horizontal row with the numbers 1-4, without repeating any of them.,
Fill each vertical column with every number, without repeating.,
Find and note the ""cages,"" thick, irregular boxes within the Kenken, to get clues to a solution.,
Know that the number and syllable at the top of each cage must be the ""goal,"" or answer, of the written numbers put inside.,
Know that subtraction and division boxes can be in any order.,
Know that the same rules apply no matter how big the puzzle gets.",How to Play Kenken1," This is where Kenken gets its similarity to Sudoku. If you have a four square by four square grid, every single horizontal row must have a 1, 2, 3, and a 4 in it. The numbers, of course, can be in any order. This is true for each row.


If your grid is a six by six, you would have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, without any repeating. If it is a 9x9, then 1-9, etc.;
, A completed Kenken needs to have every single number in every single row and column, only once. Note, however, that this doesn't just mean you fill in every single box with your numbers and win -- each puzzle still requires a specific order -- as dictated by ""cages.""

, Inside of the Kenken, there are big, thick lines marking of several boxes at once, with a mathematical equation (ex. ""3+,"" ""1-,"" ""2""). These are called cages, and they provide the puzzle and the solution. Make a note of them, making sure you understand what boxes they cover.


Cages can be straight, composed of either a single block or many at once, or L-shaped. Just follow the big, thick lines.
Before beginning, make sure you can tell the edges of the each cage to prevent mistakes.
Every box will be in a cage of some sort., If you have four numbers in a cage labeled ""8+,"" then the four numbers in that cage must add up to eight, like 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 (note that this would be an L-shaped cage, otherwise you'd have two 2s in the same line!). So a cage with two boxes labeled ""3-"" would have to have two numbers that, when subtracted, equal 3, like 4 and 1. Every cage will have a goal -- and this is how you solve Ken Ken.


Kenken only contains addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).Cages with only one box and no mathematical symbol (""4"") mean you just place the number in the box on its own. If the box just says ""4,"" just put a 4 in the box.

, If you have a box that asks for ""2÷,"" you can answer it with either ""4 | 2"" or ""2 | 4."" You just need the two correct numbers in the equation -- the order doesn't matter., These rules all still apply no matter if you're playing a 4x4 or a 9x9. While the difficulty of the puzzle increases depending on the size, the actual rules and strategy for solving it do not.


If you're a beginner, start with 4x4 boards to get used to the system and strategy. Some papers even offer 3x3 grids for beginners too."
"
Always check all three sets of clues before putting in a number.,
Fill in blank single boxes first.,
Find and mark the boxes that only have one potential answer.,
Write smaller numbers in the upper right corner to take notes, crossing them off as they are eliminated.,
Use groupings of potential numbers to fill in the areas you're unsure of.",How to Play Kenken2," Remember, you have to pay attention to three separate rules when inputting numbers, but this is to your advantage. Very few numbers satisfy all three conditions, and this is where your solution comes from:


Only one of each number in each horizontal row.
Only one of each number in each vertical column.
The answer of each cage matches the number and mathematical symbol in the upper left corner., Take all of the basic boxes without mathematical symbols first, like ""2,"" or ""9"" and simply fill in the number. If the box just says two, put in a two. This will take care of the basics and start to reveal other answers., This will depend on the size of the board, but you'll still find them easily with some practice. For example, imagine a 4x4 puzzle. Take a two box cage for ""3-."" Knowing that you only have 1, 2, 3, and 4 to choose from, you know that there is only one pair that subtracts to three, 4 and 1. While you might not know the order, you do know these are the only two numbers in this row. Make a note of them for later. Every Kenken has some of these ""easy"" boxes to get you started, such as:


Multiplication/division by grid size and odd numbers usually only has a few answers. Examples include ""4x"" in a 4x4 grid (1 & 4), ""15x"" in a 6x6 grid (3 & 5), etc.
Two-box addition cages, usually for 3+ or 4+ (can only use 1, 2, and 3)., There are a lot of places where two numbers will equally plausible, as you don't know enough about the rest of the board to figure out which number is correct. Write small notes in the upper right corner of the box, allowing you to see which numbers could be in each place, and which numbers have to be there. For example:In the previous step, you noted that you need a 4 and a 1 to make 3-, but you didn't know what order. But if the same row as the top box already contains a 4, then suddenly it's all clear. The 1 goes on top, and the 4 goes below, making your ""3-.""

, For example, imagine a vertical row that already contains a 4 and a blank in the top boxes. The bottom two boxes are a cage for ""3+,"" which can only be created with a 1 and a 2. This means the second box must be a 3, even though you don't know what order the 1 and 2 are. The finished cage would look like this:


4
3
1 or 2
1 or 2

"
"
Keep track of which numbers you cannot use in bigger Kenken puzzles.,
Understand the total sum of each row, and use the current numbers in it, to tackle tricky areas.,
Expand the row by row sums above to account for 2-3 rows at once.,
Notice ""X-wing pairs"" to eliminate potential locations for numbers.",How to Play Kenken3," If you've got a three box ""15+"" cage in a 6x6 grid, you can't use a 1 or 2. Ever. You simply couldn't add any other two numbers up with 1 or 2 to get top 15. If the cage isn't L-shaped, you can't even use a 3, since only 6+6+3 = 15 and you can't use two sixes in a row. This may seem like useless information, but it means that the row or column must have its 1, 2, or 3 further down. By knowing you can't use them in the cage, you also tell yourself that they must be used further down the line.

, Best shown in an example, imagine a row 6-box row. Since it must contain the numbers 1-6, each row will always add up to 21 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21). Now imagine a 4 box, 12+ cage in that row. You might not know which four numbers add up to 12, but you do know that the other two boxes must add up to 9, since the whole row must equal 21, and you know that part of it adds up to 12. This means your top box can suddenly contain only 2 pairs -- 3 & 6 or 4 & 5.


4 x 4 puzzle rows must add up to 10.
6 x 6 puzzle rows must add up to 21.
9 x 9 puzzle rows must add up to 45.
Talented puzzlers can do the same thing with multiplication, too. For example, each row of a 6x6 must multiply to 720. If you have a big product in one row, find out what you have left to eliminate numbers., The strategy above is great for single row problems, but any non-linear cages and you'll be lost. However, remember that each row of a 6x6 equals 21, meaning that any two rows must equal 42. Similarly, if the product of one row is 720, then the product of two rows must be 7202. If you've got some cages with big sums or products (""20+,"" ""45x""), you can subtract or divide these out to make the rest of the rows easier to solve.

, For difficult Kenkens, erasing possibilities is just as important as finding the right numbers. The ""X-wing"" is when you have the same possible number (say, a 2) in two side-by-side boxes in two different places (see example below). You might not know which one goes where, but know that two of those four boxes contain a 2. If a two is in the left box on one row, then it must be on the right box of the other row (because you can only have one 2 in each row). However, X-winging is when you can eliminate all 2s from every other space in the two rows (shown by the ""X""). A two must be in the top or bottom -- meaning it cannot be in the middle rows. You can therefore eliminate any twos in between:2 or 4 | 2 or 3
X | X
X | X
2 or 3 | 2 or 1

, Then make an 9 by 9 grid on each sheet.

, Do the same on the other grid.

, That selection should be arranged like an even bigger square. Copy the arrangement onto your friend’s grid in the same place. Make sure that the letters and numbers correspond.

Surrounding each X should be 3, 5 or 8 squares. Any mines in the corner will be surrounded by 3 squares, any mines bordering the edge of the grid will be surrounded by 5 squares, and all other mines will be surrounded by 8 squares. We will call these squares ‘’’border squares.’’’

, Figure out how many mines are surrounding the border square. The answer will be written as a number on the border square.

, To make sure you’ve filled them all in, just look at how many border squares are labeled around each mine. If a mine has only 7 labeled border squares, you probably missed one.

Choose one person to be the ""host."",
If you are the host, choose a secret word.,
Draw a blank line for each letter in the word.,
Start guessing letters if you are the player.,
Fill the letter in the blanks if the players guess correctly.,
Draw part of the ""hangman"" when the players guess wrong.,
The players win when they guess the correct word.,
Play online or on an app to practice by yourself.",How to Play Hangman1," This is the person that invents the puzzle for the other person to solve. They will be tasked with choosing a word or phrase that ""the players"" will have to solve.


The host should be able to spell confidently or the game will be impossible to win.;
, The other players will need to guess your word letter by letter, so choose a word you think will be difficult to guess. Difficult words usually have uncommon letters, like ""z,"" or ""j,"" and only a few vowels.


For longer games, you can also choose phrases.

, For example, if the executioner chooses the word ""zipper,"" she/he would draw six blanks, one for each letter ( _ _ _ _ _ _ ). The host does not tell anyone else the secret word.

, Once the word has been chosen and the players know how many letters in the secret word, begin guessing which letters are in the word by asking the host. For example, you might begin by asking, ""is there an 'e' in your word?""


Generally, start by guessing common letters like vowels, ""s,"" ""t,"" and ""n.""

, Whenever the players guess a letter that is in the secret word, the host fills it into the blank where it occurs. For example, if the word is ""zipper"" and the players guess ""e,"" then the host will fill in the 5th blank with an ""e:"" (_ _ _ _ e _).


If the players guess a letter that repeats, fill in both letters. If they guess ""p,"" you would have to fill in both ""p""s. ( _ _ p p e _ ).

, Whenever the players guess a letter that is not in the secret word they get a strike that brings them closer to losing. To show this, the host draws a simple stick figure of a man being hung, adding a new part to the drawing with every wrong answer. This is also where you can adjust the difficulty of the game -- the more marks you make, the more wrong guesses the player gets and the easier the game is. The classic order is:



First wrong answer: Draw and upside-down ""L."" This is the post the man hangs from.

Second: Draw a small circle for the ""head"" underneath the horizontal line of the ""L.""

Third: Draw a line down from the bottom of the head for the ""body.""

Fourth: Draw one arm out from the middle of his body for the ""arm.""

Fifth: Draw the other arm.

Sixth: Draw one diagonal line from the bottom of the body for the first ""leg.""

Seventh: Draw the other leg.

Eighth: Connect the head to the post with a ""noose."" Once you draw the noose the players have lost the game.

, If the players get every letter of the word before the host finishes drawing then they win. At any point a player can try to guess the entire word instead of a single letter, but if they guess the wrong word then the host should treat it as if they guessed a wrong letter.


To make the game harder, make a rule saying that the players can only guess the secret word once before they lose.

, Thanks to it's simplicity, online hangman games are everywhere, and easy to find with a quick internet search for ""online hangman."" Many games use online dictionaries to choose words, allowing your to practice building your vocabulary while you play. You can even play games against opponents from all over the world with some apps.

Start with three circles for the body, then add add eyes, nose, and buttons for each wrong answer. The rest of the rules remain the same., This game works best with longer words or phrases. The rules are the same with one crucial exception: every other letter you guess should not be in the secret word. The player needs to alternate guessing letters that are in the word (the ""in"" round) and letters that are not in the word (the ""out"" round) until they win or lose.


If the player says a letter that is in the secret word the host writes it in regardless of the round the player is in. If they guess a letter that is in the word while on the ""out"" round, they still get a strike, however.

Understand The Effects of Rage.",How to Play a Barbarian in Dungeons and Dragons V3.5," Before the first session of a campaign where you plan to play a barbarian you should read the entire entry on them in the Player's Handbook (PHB).;
, Not every race makes a good barbarian. Half-Orcs and humans make the best barbarians. Dwarfs make acceptable barbarians, although Dwarf barbarians are rare. Elves, Half-Elves, Gnomes, and Halflings all make poor barbarians.

, Consult the Dungeon Master (DM) and figure out how vital statistics (stats) will be generated. As a barbarian your most important stats are, in order of importance; Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity. Good Intelligence or Wisdom could be helpful at times, but your physical stats matter most.

, Barbarians tend to be the kind of people who live on their own in the wild and solve their problems with violence. Choosing skills and feats to fit this model will be easiest and quite effective. Barbarians have far fewer feats than fighters, reflecting their lack of formal training, but a number of special abilities help to make up for this. Climb, Jump, and Survival are good skills for a barbarian. Weapon Focus, Power Attack, and Improved Initiative are good feats for barbarians.

,, Barbarians should start with a primary weapon, a backup weapon, armor, and survival gear (bedroll, rations, etc.). If you choose a one handed weapon then a shield is also a good idea. Barbarians tend to be mobile and so consider sticking with light armor. Studded leather is good at first and then you can upgrade to a chain shirt when you have the money. The great-club, great-axe, and great-sword, are common and excellent weapon choices. You may want to carry a ranged weapon just in case, such as a few javelins.

, You, like the fighter, are in the party to take hits and give hits. Your good armor class (AC) and very high hit points (HP) make you difficult to kill. Barbarians tend to rush in and swing wildly at the enemy until it dies. You will be nearly useless in social encounters, but that does not mean you have to remain silent. You may never convince anyone to change their mind but perhaps your character will try anyway.

, On a piece of scrap paper you should keep track of every important number that changes when you rage and what the new value will be, because there are a lot of changes.


The following is a list of modifiers that change when your barbarian rages; attack bonus, damage bonus, AC, HP, will save, fortitude save, and all skills based on Strength or Constitution. It slows down game play if you have to recalculate these values every time you rage.
Remember that when the rage ends your hit points revert to normal, this effect can kill you. For example, a 5th level barbarian with 50HP rages. Because his Constitution goes up by 4 his Constitution modifier goes up by 2. Since HP are affected by your Constitution modifier the barbarian gains 2 HP for each level for 10 more HP, giving him 60.
When his rage ends, this goes back to 50. Here is where you have to be careful. Say this barbarian takes 40 total damage during his rage, now he is down to 20HP. Then his rage ends. He still has 40 damage but now he has only 50HP max, so his current HP drops to 10. If he had 55 damage during the fight he would drop to -5 when the rage ended and fall unconscious, seconds away from death. If this sudden drop of HP puts the barbarian at -10 or lower he dies instantly.

, Make sure to consider and cover the following:



Social Dynamic: Are there different races, clans or tribes within the region? How do the people treat each other and outsiders on an individual basis? Any out of the norm national or domestic traditions or practices? On a larger scale, what is the overall societal feel of the region? Perhaps it's coming apart at the seams from civil war, with roving death squads or maybe there's a tentative peace. On the other extreme it could be highly patriotic or religious, full of tight-knit, radical nationalists or zealots...







Fashion and Language: Decide how the people of the area dress, how they adorn themselves (popular jewelry, hairstyles, tattoos?), their language(s) and how they speak.







Calendar: What are some holidays, festivals or other popular observances?







Religion: What is the dominant religion, if any, and how powerful is the priesthood?







Art: Cover some artistic output and distinctions: music, high art and folk art, literature, folklore, theater, architecture...






Come up with one or two other societal and social aspects, like caste systems or major cultural taboos.







, Legal punishments and consequences. Are there any specific laws governing magic? Are servants and landholders free/serfs/indentured/slaves? What is the judicial system like, if there is one (a trial or hearings, representation, guilty-until-proven-innocent/vice versa, thrown in the dungeon and wait for the Holy Fruit Bats of Kayobish to decide...)? What other fundamental rights do people have under the law, again, if any (property rights, parental responsibilities, due process)? What are the rulers like? Are there different duchies, protectorates or provinces with different laws? Are the rulers themselves of the regular variety (officials, nobles, bureaucrats) or unusual (mages, undead lords, priests)?

,,, Are they a conquering empire or do they trade and interact peaceably? Are there old feuds or alliances? Could they care less about each other?

, What do they import? What do they export? Are there taxes of any kind (usually yes if it's a kingdom)? What are the local resources (from the land and the populace)? How much influence do the merchants and traders have? Describe the country's specific currency system if they have one, or do they barter or trade gems or something else? Are there any disproportionate gaps in economic classes that could potentially cause trouble?

, How advanced or crude are their tactics, weapons and war machines? How about standing forces versus reserves? Drafting? How do they all coordinate and react in times of war and conflict? Does the army hire mercenaries? How many? What kind? What arcane-aided tactics do they employ (undead or supernatural troops, magical weapons among the forces, war wizards or, for the overly dramatic, flame throwers)?

, Describe some outstanding flora and fauna, unusual or magical things included. What kinds of ""uncivilized"" humanoids live in the wilderness? Describe the major weather patterns of the region. How does the local geography and weather effect the populace, if at all (if it's a mercantile society are they coastal and sea-faring merchants or maybe land-bound nomad traders)? Create one or more encounter tables for the wilderness.

, Are there stone arches or canyons? Lush river valleys? A vast field of geysers? Forests, cave networks? A mile-high cliff or waterfall? A magical desert in the middle of a jungle? Limestone cliffs that fall into the ocean when there's an earthquake, causing immense tsunamis?

, Cities and dungeons often need detailed descriptions all on their own. Do it now if you're inspired or get a general feel for them, then, work out the details after you've finished your country. Create encounter tables for cities and dungeons.

, Also use this section to describe the main types of transportation found within the region as well as any prominent nearby currents or maritime trade routes for sea-faring cultures.

, Try to deviate from the standard RPG historical interactions (that is, 'barbarians fought the mages' or 'dragons attacked'). Come up with a few twists to make it interesting. For example, perhaps the dwarves and the gnolls are loyal allies after they had to band together thousands of years ago to fight an even greater evil. Maybe the gnolls even let the dwarves ride them into battle now. Figure out why.

,, What is happening currently in the region (specifically things that could involve the PCs)? Are there coups or power-plays in the making? Is a colossal monster, plague or natural disaster about to strike? Maybe all is well and quiet for a change or maybe happenings here could affect the entire continent or world.

, Note here if there are any popular mercenary or adventuring companies in the area and how adventurers are treated.

, Use them to maybe introduce your players into the area.

First you will need the actual Clue game.,
Have everyone choose a character.,
Mix up the character cards and have each person choose one.,
Next is to choose a weapon.,
Now it's time to place the characters.,
Now for the backstory.,
As the second turn comes around, each player can decide to stay in their starting room or draw another room card.,
Would you like to make an alliance?,
How to kill your target.,
Once you have killed off your target everyone becomes free game.",How to Make Clue Into an RPG," You could use any version if you don't have the original, but the original game is preferred.;
, If there is a dispute about who should be who then have people draw character cards instead.

, Don't hold onto the cards put place them back into the deck for the next person to choose. The character that you have picked is now your target, and the one you want to kill. It is alright if people have the same target, it just matters who gets to them first.

, Everyone gets one weapon that they draw from the weapons deck. No two characters should have the same weapon since there are enough to go around.

, Each person will choose a room and place their piece in that room. After drawing the card return it to the deck.

, On the first turn no one is allowed to kill anyone. The first turn is only there to explain why your character is in that room. Such as: Professor Plum was conducting an experiment in the library with his wrench. He wanted to see if he could efficiently pull books off shelves.


Your introduction story can be as long or as short as you want it. It can be funny, creepy, or as horrific as you want it to be.

, By choosing a room card, the player has to explain why they are leaving and why they are in the new room. The character is also allowed to pick up objects from the room they just left, like food, kitchen utensils, or books.

, Players may choose to make an alliance with characters that are in the same room as their character. When an alliance is made, the characters move around together no matter what. The upside to this, is that your character is able to move to two rooms each turn. Since it is you and another character who are moving from room to room.

, Now if you are in the room with your target you have the option of attacking and potentially killing your target. Here, you describe, in as much detail as you want, how you are killing your target. Taking up the dice, the attacker and the attacked roll one each. If the attacker rolls higher than the attacked, the attacked is dead. However, if the dice are equal or the attacked rolls higher than the attacked gets to live for another turn.

, After all, the object of the game is to be the last one standing.

"

Get your body used to a warmer climate.,
Start to suppress your emotions.,
Increase your vocabulary and be more intelligent.,
Meditate or set up a meditation schedule.,
To greet and send off people, you say, ""Live long and prosper,"" while holding your hand (does not matter which) in the Vulcan Ta'al, or Vulcan hand sign.

,
Let your mind be governed by logic.,
When speaking, do not use contractions!,
Make sure that you are always perfectly groomed.,
Vulcans do not like to be touched, so stay away from others.,
Do not touch your food unless necessary.,
Slowly eat more and more plants and dwindle down on meat.,
Be completely devoid of all emotion.,
Congratulations!",How to Live Like a Vulcan," Vulcans live on a 132º Fahrenheit planet, so it pays to have this step in check.;
, Vulcans still feel emotion, but they do not show it. Start by being quieter and listening more.

, The species you are trying to imitate has a very wide range of vocabulary and can calculate odds in a nano-second! Try to be good or at least more than adequate at mathematics and science. Or specialize in one subject. Try to be extraordinary at everything though.

, This step is very crucial to suppressing your emotions! You may wish to learn to meditate.

,, Yes, this may mean giving up watching the series finale of The Walking Dead or your favorite television show for an hour working out, but that is the logical decision! Let logic decide your actions.

, Vulcans believe contractions in sentences are illogical.

, These people are the image of perfection! Complete the image of a true Vulcan with the facial and hair perfection!

, Vulcans are touch-telepaths, meaning they can feel others emotions through touch. If Vulcans feel too much emotion they will break their façade.

, Opt for utensils.

, This species is mainly vegetarian, but will eat meat on the rare occasion that it is necessary.

, Vulcans show absolutely no emotion. This means you must show none also.

, You now act like and live like a Vulcan. Live long and prosper.

at least one of every basic type of die (d4 (4-sided die), d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20)
a copy of the player’s handbook for D&D 3.5
a copy of the character sheets (found in the back of the handbook)
the six starting ability scores for your character (found in Chapter 1 or by consulting your DM)
a pencil;
, The top section of the first page is all up to your personal tastes.


Character Name: Choose a good name!
Player: This will be your name.
Class and level: The class is chosen by you in Chapter 3. The starting level is determined by the DM, but is generally first level.
Race: This is chosen by you in Chapter 2.
All other features: These are personal choices made by you during character creation. Be realistic. Consult Chapter 6 for advice on how to choose these traits.

, Take your prepared ability scores and write them into the “ability score” column, next to their corresponding ability. This score should include the base score and any additional modifiers (such as a racial bonus). The ability modifier in the next column is calculated by subtracting ten from the ability score, dividing the remainder by two, and rounding down. For example, an ability score of 15 would have a +2 ability modifier (15-10 = 5, 5/2 = 2.5, rounded down = +2).


Your DM may have you use the temporary score and modifier columns during your adventure, but for right now leave them blank.

, HP stands for “hit points”. This is how much damage your character can take. Speed is how quickly your character can move in a single action during combat. AC stands for “armor class” and describes how hard your character is to be hit by attacks.


HP: Your total HP (hit points) is calculated by rolling your class’ hit die (noted in the class description in the player’s handbook) and adding your constitution modifier to it. This is done upon attaining each new level. At first level, however, your character receives the full hit die and constitution modifier worth of points. A rogue, for example, with a hit die of d6 and a constitution modifier of +2 would receive 8 hit points at first level and would roll a d6 and add 2 HP for each subsequent level.
Wounds/Current HP: This area will be used to keep track of your characters HP during the game. You can use it to count up damage received or use it to count down your characters HP. In the beginning, you should have full HP.
Nonlethal Damage: This area can remain blank, as your character is at full HP.
Speed: Your character’s speed is noted under your race in Chapter 2 of the Player’s Handbook. Generally, this is 30 feet (9.1 m). Certain things in the game, such as items, encumbrance, or class features, may modify your speed.
AC: Your AC is calculated by Armor Bonus (from worn armor), Shield Bonus (from wielded shields), Dex Modifier (Dexterity Modifier), Size Modifier (noted in Chapter 2 under your race), Natural Modifier (attained later in the game, but generally unavailable at first level), Deflection Modifier (AC bonuses through magical items), and Misc Modifiers (anything not covered in the previous categories).
Damage Reduction: Consult your DM to determine if your character has any.

, Touch and Flat-Footed ACs describe special situations in the game, where an attack simply needs to make contact (touch) or your character is caught unawares (flat-footed). These attacks are generally easier to pull off and are calculated differently. Initiative represents how quickly your character responds to battle and is used to modify a d20 roll to determine turn order in combat.


Touch AC: This value is your AC without Armor, Shield, and Natural Bonuses.
Flat-Footed: This value is your AC without the Dex Modifier added.
Initiative: This value is your Dex Modifier plus any Misc Modifiers (such as the feat Improved Initiative).

, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will Saves are used to represent the resilience of a character to certain conditions in the game. Fortitude, for example, is used to show toughness against punishment and poisons. Reflex Saves could be used to avoid a magical explosion. Will Saves could save your character from being mind-controlled by an evil sorcerer. Each of them are calculated by adding up the following numbers:


Base Save: This value is located on the corresponding leveling chart of your character’s class in Chapter 3. A level one fighter, for example, has a +2 Fortitude, +0 Reflex, and a +0 Base Will Save.
Ability Modifier: This value comes from the corresponding ability. For Fortitude, use the Constitution Modifier. For Reflex, use the Dexterity Modifier. For Will, use the Wisdom Modifier.
Magic Modifier: This value comes from any active spells of magical items on your character.
Misc Modifier: This value comes from anything not covered in the previous categories (such as feats or racial traits).
Temporary & Additional Modifiers: Leave blank for now.

, Your character’s base attack is what you will use in combat (with other stats) to determine the success of your attacks. Spell resistance shows how much defense your character has against unwanted magical effects. Grappling is a method of combat in which you grab your foe.


Base Attack Bonus: This value is located on the corresponding leveling chart of your character’s class in Chapter 3. A level one fighter, for example, has a +1 BAB.
Spell Resistance: This box can be left blank at this time. Your DM will inform you if you need to fill it.
Grapple: This value is found by adding your character’s BAB, Strength Modifier, Size Modifier (found under your race in Chapter 2), and any Misc Modifiers (such as from feats or class features).

, Each box here represents a form of attack for your character. These may be with a melee weapon (like a sword), a ranged weapon (like a bow), or a natural weapon (like a punch).


Attack: This is the type of weapon being used (sword, bow, etc).
Attack Bonus: This is total bonus you will add to a d20 roll to determine the success of your attack. This includes the BAB, corresponding ability modifier (strength for melee or natural, dexterity for ranged), and any Misc Modifiers (such as bonuses provided by the weapon or feats).
Damage, Critical, Range, Type, and Notes: These can be found in the corresponding weapon description in Chapter 7.
Ammunition: This is where you will keep track of the type of ammo for your weapon and the amount you have on your character.

, Your character is defined in no small way by the things he or she can do besides attacking. This area is used to keep track of the prowess of your character in performing other actions in the game. Certain skills are class skills (actions your class are proficient in doing) and cross-class skill (actions that come harder as part of your class).


Max Ranks: Your characters max class skill ranks will be his or her level +3. The max cross-class skill ranks will be half of the max class skill rank value.
Class Skills?: Each box that is next to a class skill of your character should be marked. Check the corresponding class description in Chapter 3 to verify which these are.
Blank spaces next to skills: These areas are to specify what the skill is in. For example, one skill may be Craft (Armor) and another may be Craft (Crossbow). Check skill description in Chapter 4 to learn more.
Key Modifier: This describes the ability modifier that is important to this skill. Copy the corresponding modifier into the Ability Modifier column.
Skill Modifier: This value is calculated by adding up the Ability Modifier, Ranks, and Misc Modifier.
Ranks: These are purchased using skill points upon advancement to a new level. Each class gets a certain number of new skill points plus their intelligence modifier. This can be found in the corresponding class description in Chapter 3. A sorcerer, for example, gains 2 skill points plus his or her Int Modifier per level. At first level, this value is multiplied by four. These points may be spent in any skill. One skill point buys one rank in a class skill. One skill point buys half of a rank in a cross-class skill. The total number of ranks in a particular skill may not exceed the values in the Max Ranks section.
Misc Modifier: These are additional bonuses from sources other than Ability Modifiers and Ranks, such as racial traits or feats.

, This area shows what story the character is participating in and how many experience points the character has attained thus far.


Campaign: This name will be provided by the DM.
Experience Points: This value will be provided by the DM. Generally at level one, this value is 0.

, Gear is essential to your character’s adventure. Consult your DM on what items and wealth your character will start with in the campaign. Consult Chapter 7 to purchase additional gear for your character.


Gear: This area is used for armor, shields, and other items that provide protection. The information here can be copied from the corresponding description in Chapter 7 or from your DM in some circumstances.
Other Possessions: This area is used for items other than those in the Gear area being carried by your character (this includes all weapons). Use the corresponding descriptions in Chapter 7 to fill out these entries (PG being the page number and WT being the weight of the item), adding up all of the total weight of both Gear and Other Possessions. The bottom section (Loads) is filled in using the beginning of Chapter 9 and your Strength Modifier. Lifts and Push are calculated as noted on the character sheet.
Money: This area is used to note how much CP (copper pieces), SP (silver), GP (gold), and PP (platinum) your character is carrying. This is determined by following the instructions in your class description in Chapter 2 or by asking your DM.

, These things help flesh out your character and bring it more to life.


Feats: This spot is to make note of possessed feats and their pages in the handbook (Chapter 5). Characters at first level generally have just one.
Special Abilities: This area is to note any characteristics of the character provided by your class or race. There is also a spot for the corresponding page number from the handbook.
Languages: This area is to note any languages known by the character. Each character knows common, their racial languages (found in Chapter 2), and one additional language per +1 of Int Modifier.

, The remainder of the character sheet is used for magic users. This area may be skipped by any classes that don’t use magic. For those that do use magic, proceed as follows.


Spells: This area is to note the spells known or frequently used by your character.
Spell Save & Arcane Spell Failure: These are explained in Chapter 10.
Level section: This area is filled out using the corresponding class description in Chapter 3 and the magic chapter in Chapter 10.

Think of the basic theme of the game.,

Campaigns are the game.,
Come up with a list of 5-10 classes and races (both are optional, any mix but both are recommended.,
Develop the classes, stats, races, stat percentages (effects and for if for example, for every 1 STR you have it adds another 2-4 damage, but after level 4 it adds 4-8), bestiary, professions if you want too, effects such as poison, freeze burn and stun, equipment (there should be slots.,Make sure that most things are balanced (skills and the such)

,, Just like how there is in WoW, DnD, EQ, EQ2, DDO, WK, MS, AQW, DF, MQ, WF, AQ and every other game, campaigns make the base structure of the game more exciting, and can help you come up with things to add later on.

Know how to show commands in role-playing.,
Avoid typing commands like this:


*Says how are you doing?,
Say it without typing something like what is shown up above.,
Be creative with details.,
Set up a roleplay beginning.,
Know how to pause, and jump out of the roleplay when you are being involved with other parts of your life.,
Know when to use the parentheses.,
Now back to the SETTING.,
Talk to the person who you want to ROLE-PLAY with or who wants to ROLE-PLAY with me, and ask what the SUBJECT/SETTING of the story is about.,
Make sure you know what you are role-playing about, and then just go with the flow.,
Now, time for the next part of role-playing.,
To become truly experienced in role-playing you need to understand that role-playing can become anywhere from SEXUAL to FIGHTING.",How to Do the Original Roleplaying Online," Some of the most common ways to type out commands are to use these symbols then type any action that you are doing between them.


You can use DASHES ( - - )
You can use ASTERISKS ( * * )
The more modern way is to just type normal. For example, Jon walked up to Billy and said, ""Hey Billy! Long time no see."";
,*

, Here are a few examples on correct ways to do role-playing:


*Dances on the dance floor* Hey, you want to dance with me?
-Looks around to see if there are intruders- This land isn’t safe, we should find safer grounds
- Jon walked over to the school bench slowly then sat down, staring at the big fat F on his paper. -
*Looks at you* What's up?

, Role-playing is all about details, typing somewhat quick, and having a wide open imagination. Cause without those, you are going to have one really boring roleplay.

,


Now, this is most likely the most important part of the role-playing sequence.
This is because when you are role-playing, you don’t really need to plan ahead, but you need to know how to start out a story.
Normally it is best that before you roleplay with someone, you talk to them about where the SETTING is at. This is a very important key to keeping a story going, because you don’t want to just say something random then have the other person become confused, cause the story line doesn’t match what they expected.

, This is the only REAL way to jump out of a ROLE-PLAY temporarily or permanently is to use PARENTHESES ( ).


The PARENTHESES are used when you need to take a break or leave the game cause you got busy with something else. Now, I’m going to show you an example on how to use these correctly:

EX: *Continues to sit on the floor against the wall*



, Now, when it comes to the PARENTHESES, you can use them a lot or you can use them rarely, but when using them you need to make sure that you use them with caution cause if you constantly type them in, you may ruin the game for you and the other role-player.

, This is a very delicate part of the whole ROLE-PLAYING subject, cause if you have no real storyline to start out at, the ROLE-PLAY will be very boring cause neither of you will have any clue on how to react anymore. So, anyway, when you want a SETTING to be created, it is best you talk about it ahead of time cause you wouldn’t want to start a game without any idea of where it takes place at.

, Many people get into a long detailed storyline about their life or something similar. People also do ROLE-PLAYING that is like a fantasy movie, its full of mythology or other assortments.

, Role-playing is all about being freestyle, there is no exact storyline to everything, role-playing isn’t like a book, you don’t just read through and follow everything the way you think they should be, sometimes, mistakes are meant to be made.

, When it comes to being sexually active with someone during role-playing, you need to make sure the details are very NAUGHTY. Because a really good SEXUAL roleplay makes the person HORNY in real life.


Again, overall, role-playing is supposed to be played out is if there is no real storyline, you can act anyway you want, but you can’t roleplay to where you are jumping ahead way to fast.
EX:

RPer1: *Sits on the ground watching the tv*
RPer2: *Strips your clothes off and has sex with you*

Wrong! Before you do any commands that affect the other role-player you make sure both people are willing to participate in the same role-playing form. If you try to affect the other role-player against his/her wishes, then you can held liable for verbal assault or other problems. When it comes to role-playing, everyone is supposed to enjoy it and just go with the flow of how the roleplay is set.





, Role-playing is all about having fun with what you are doing, and if you find what you’re doing not fun, then look for another version of it.

Get the Core Books.,
Read Through the Dungeon Master's Guide.,
Consider Your Players.,
Decide on an Inside-out or Outside-in Design.,
Make your World Detailed.,
Start designing the campaign!,
In reference to the previous section, start with a reason why the PC's are together in a party.,
You will also undoubtedly have to use the same set of 1st level monsters that everyone uses, but it is the presentation that counts.,
Introduce the adventure hook early.",How to Create a Dungeons and Dragons World," Do not play Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) if you do not have the core books (the Monster Manual, Player's Handbook, and Dungeon Master's Guide). This may seem redundant to most people, but doubtless, someone will come along without the books and read this. So please, for the sake of you and your players, get yourself a hard copy of the 3 Core Books. You may think that the System Reference Document (SRD) is sufficient but you will find that you cannot look through it quickly enough and so relying on it will slow down the game.

, ""Chapter 5: Campaigns"" is all about making the campaign and the world (in Version 3.5). There you will find more details about the technical aspects of world-building in D&D, this article will focus on the more subjective elements. You will want to read through this chapter before you begin.

, The Dungeon Master's job is to make a fun game, to put it simply. The best way to accomplish this requires you to know your players; what they like, what they do not like, what they think is cool, what they think is frightening, and so on. If you know this information then you can design a world that will capture their attention. If you have a player who is an athlete then you could make a country that plays a strange fantasy sport. If you have a player who is interested in archeology then add some ancient ruins. Choose setting elements, good guys, bad guys, weird guys, etc. so that your players will be interested.

, How do you want to design your campaign? Do you want to start with a little hamlet on the edge of the world, or do you want to start with a design of the entire world? Inside-out means that you start with giving detail about just one specific place, and expand out as needed. Outside-in means that you start with a view of the entire thing, and then you gradually zoom into one specific place, adding detail about the continent, region, etc. as you move in. Each method has its merits. You must consider your needs and how much time you have to prepare.


If you are playing at low levels then inside-out is the okay because your characters will not be able to travel quickly. This will give you a chance to expand the game world as they travel. This way you can possibly fix some early mistakes as your characters travel to new places.
If you are starting at a higher level, especially after the characters can teleport, you need to be ready for anything. This type of campaign requires extensive preparation. At high levels your players need a whole world to play in.

, The more details you have for your world the more your players will enjoy playing in it. Believability comes from details. At this point you are going to have to start keeping records. You will need to draw at some maps, at least sketch them. You will need to make lists of key information for towns and Non-Player Characters (NPCs) as well.


Know how much is too much. The players will get annoyed if every single person the party meets has a description that takes ten minutes to read through. A few little tidbits makes an incidental character like a peasant on the road more interesting, but save the extensive details for major characters in your campaign.

, Congratulations, you have a world for your Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Now, make a campaign to go along with it, so your players actually have something to do. After all, saying ""Here's the world... No, I don't actually have an adventure for you..."" is perhaps the worst thing that someone could do in Dungeons and Dragons. So get started, DM, and remember: half the work is already done now.

, Perhaps they have been friends for a long time, or they have all been hired by a single person or town to accomplish a task that requires a group. Be original, unless you players are first-timers, the old man at the edge of town who hints that there is treasure in the nearby goblin cave will be a cliché. You might still want to have the PC's exploring a cave filled with goblins, but make the adventure hook a bit more interesting, like a mining company whose workers were attacked in said cave and wants its equipment and captured workers back.

, Don't just use goblins wielding swords led by a bigger goblin with a bigger sword, use goblins with a class level in cleric or rogue for the leaders and give the rest of them interesting weapons, tactics, and items like spears (goblins with reach!), nets, pots of boiling water, and other level appropriate nasty stuff to use on the PC's.

, Nothing is worse for PC's than aimlessly wandering about trying to find something to do. Maybe that mining company is really a secret excavation team run by a neighboring kingdom who is trying to find a powerful item rumored to be buried nearby. Perhaps the goblins have evidence in their den that they are being recruited by a nearby orc overlord into a bandit gang to start sacking nearby towns, and the mine was just the beginning. Be creative! The campaign should have direction before the first adventure has even ended. Low level campaigns are also a good time to start establishing mid and high level enemies the PC's will fight later. If your goal is to have the PC's fight Baron Von-Whoopass at 20th level on the deck of his flying pirate ship, have him show up now, burn a few towns to the ground and hint that the baron is looking to employ wizards with woodworking experience.

Keep NPCs in character.",How to Create a Dungeons and Dragons Campaign," Your campaign might be a one-off where you journey through a dungeon to slay a monster in a single session, but longer campaigns could require several sessions of play time before they're finally done. If you're trying to create a one-off, aim for simple goals for the players. Larger scope games usually involve some kind of intrigue or overarching goal of an enemy.Some classic themes for campaigns include treasure hunting, saving the kingdom from danger, and slaying deadly monsters.
If you want a truly epic campaign, you might send players on a crusade into hostile lands. This kind of setting provides plenty of opportunities for combat.
Beginners may want to start with simple, one session campaigns to get the hang of DMing before moving to more complex ones.

, The conflict of your campaign can be simple and direct, or it could be less obvious. A simple conflict might involve players being charged with the extermination of an evil wizard. A more complicated conflict might require players to discover a secret plot to overthrow the king.Without conflict in your campaign, characters might feel at a loss for what to do. By having a definite conflict for players to contend with, this sense of aimlessness will be less likely to occur.
If you plan on pitting player characters against an antagonist like a villain, it might help you to come up with a list of immediate and long term goals for that villain. This way, you'll have a better idea of what the antagonist is doing at any point in the campaign.

, Non-player characters, also called NPCs, are an important part of many D&D campaigns. NPCs often guide characters throughout your campaign by offering advice and hints. When listing the NPCs in your campaign, it can help to write a short description for each one. This way, you can easily remember where that NPC is coming from and how they will interact with player characters.NPCs are also a powerful way you can make your campaign seem more realistic. It's only natural that other non-player characters populate cities, towns, and farms in your campaign.
Common NPCs players might encounter in your game include kings, queens, princes, princesses, dukes, duchesses, counts, countesses, barons, mayors, governors, knights, lieutenants, generals, shopkeepers, merchants, innkeepers, guilds, craftspeople, and more.

, Since you as the DM will be describing the setting to players over the course of the game, it's a good idea to have a concrete idea of what kind of environment your campaign takes place in. Try to engage all five senses when you do so to make it easier for players to become immersed.Many beginner D&D players overlook small details, like light. In a cave or dungeon, it's unlikely there will be much natural light. Be sure you remember to include this detail when running your campaign.
It may help you to imagine your setting better if you write down the sensory perceptions for each location ahead of time.

, Central to your plot should be whatever you have chosen as the conflict for your campaign. Plot can roughly be defined as the action that will occur no matter what the player characters do. These events will help to draw players into the story and entangle them with it.An example of a plot point might be something like the assassination of an important NPC, like a queen or duke.
Natural disasters are often times used as plot points with built in conflict. These can be paired with a magical disturbance, like the meddling of an evil wizard, to create an interesting plot.
It can be useful to plan consequences even for unlikely player actions. For example, if a player chooses not to fulfill a quest, you might have the kingdom hunt the player down as a criminal., This could be anything from a ruined temple to an underground cavern. Your drawing doesn't have to be a work of art, but having it as a point of reference will help player characters coordinate action when battle begins.


Simple shapes and labels work well when drawing a battle map. You might use squares to represent boxes, triangles to represent trees, and circles for boulders.
It can take some time to draw your field of battle. To ensure the game is uninterrupted, you may want to draw your map before running your campaign.
If you have player characters fighting in several different settings, you may have to draw several battle maps for your campaign.
In some cases player characters may have important actions to fulfill in a town or city. Drawing a map for this kind of ""social battle"" can help players visualize things better. Most towns in D&D have at least a shop, tavern, and inn., There may be things in the environment, like plants or animals, that influence how characters act. For example, characters might use the vines of a jungle to create ropes to climb a cliff. You don't have to create an entire ecosystem, but a few features of your own invention will give your setting a unique appeal all its own. Each campaign will be different, but you may want to list as many concrete details as you find necessary.


If there are violent or dangerous creatures active in your setting at night time, like wolves, bears, lions, or similar creatures, it might be important for players to set watch at night. If they fail to do so, you might come up with consequences, like supplies being eaten.
You might base your environment off one that already exists on earth, like a jungle, forest, desert, or cave. You might even use one developed in a previous game you have played., Many of the environments explored by player characters will be dangerous or decayed. You should take this into consideration when planning. For example, you might have rotten flooring crumble beneath a player if they step on a certain space, or you might have enemies set traps ahead of time for unwanted guests.


Some examples of common traps include pitfalls, chambers that fill with water, arrow traps, and falling rocks.
Crumbling ledges, rotten trees, rotten flooring, loose rocks, and slippery surfaces are common terrain hazards., The challenge rating (CR) is a number given to establish the difficulty player characters will have with a beast or enemy. If the CR is higher than the level of player characters, it poses a serious threat. Beginning players may want to start with a low challenge rating.The information of many monsters, beasts, and other enemies are available online. These online bestiaries often come with CR, base stats, and some flavor text describing the creature.
In some cases, you may not know how to stat a certain creature you've created for your homebrew campaign. In this situation, you might give your creature the same stats as a similar, pre-existing creature.

, Enemies could include monsters, wild animals, enemy NPCs, gods, and more. If there are enemies in your campaign, you'll need to choose what they are and stat them accordingly. Stats will help you determine the dice rolls of these enemies when player characters encounter them.


Plan the position of enemy units on your battle map so you have a rough idea of how the action will take place once the battle begins., You'll need some kind of conceit to bring all the player characters together in a party. Oftentimes, characters will begin their adventure having just met in a tavern, or the characters could have been called to help the kingdom by an important NPC, like a king, governor, duke, or mayor.A mysterious person may have sent all the player characters a message to meet outside a cave. This way, you might tie some other aspect of the plot in with its beginning.

, You may want to incorporate invented religions in your game to create a more immersive setting for players. Some versions of D&D even require certain kinds of characters to say prayers once a day to be able to use their special abilities. For example, a priest might not be able to heal a friend without saying prayers.


Evil gods and their followers are often a compelling point of conflict player characters will have to contend with throughout your campaign.
You could create your own group of gods using the D&D model as your basis. This model can be found in the core D&D books or online.
Many experienced DMs have posted well thought out and nuanced pantheons of gods for other players to use online. , This way you'll be able to answered any detailed questions players ask over the course of your campaign. However, you should be careful not to spend too much time over planning. It's very common for players to miss details that you may have spent hours coming up with.Important NPCs often interact with player characters. In these cases, it can be difficult coming up with dialogue on the spot. Having a backstory for these NPCs may help you with this.
The region your campaign takes place in may be feeling the effects of a significant event in the past, like a war or natural disaster. These details can help you establish the tone of your campaign.

, This is a nice way of giving players a feeling of free-will in your game. Side quests can include small tasks, like delivering a letter, or more time consuming endeavors, like hunting and trapping a monster loose on the plains.Many games require a special quest item, like a rare kind of metal, to create a powerful weapon or relic. You might use this conceit for one of your side quests., Different settings will often call for different kinds of equipment. For example, if your setting takes place in rugged mountains, NPCs and towns will likely have ropes, climbing gear, and so on. Mountain towns might also have access to rare metals for powerful weapons. Plains villages, on the other hand, might have plenty of healing items and farming tools, but not much weaponry.


You might include one or two important cultural items to tie in the story of your setting with NPCs. As an example, your setting might have people that worship a god of flight, and all NPCs might wear feathered necklaces to indicate their faith.
When coming up with environment specific equipment, ask yourself, ""What would this environment require for one to survive?"" Arid cultures will likely value water highly, but polar climates will prioritize shelter, warmth, and snow tools., While running your campaign, you may be tempted to adjust the actions of NPCs to make things more interesting. However, this can result in players feeling like you are manipulating events. Try to play NPCs as though they are independent from you and do not share your knowledge of the campaign.

This has resulted in many different versions of D&D being in circulation, with some versions considered superior to others.


You and those you’re playing with should all use a single version when making characters or playing a campaign.
The calculations in provided in the following examples are based off Pathfinder, an extensive online available version of D&D that is compatible with D&D Version 3.5. Some versions may use different calculations.

D&D 5th Edition’s basic rules were released in 2014 and shortly followed by the Starter Set, an adventure module, the Player’s Handbook, and more.Many online resources can be found for various versions of D&D. Find the core rulebooks of versions by doing an online keyword search for them, as in, “Pathfinder core rulebook.”;
, A character sheet will lay out all the information you’ll need to create a character in an orderly fashion. However, you could always write out your character information by hand on a blank sheet of paper, or type it up on a computer.


Free character sheets can be found online. Do a keyword search for “dungeons and dragons character sheets” to find and print one of your own.Example character sheets can be found on the D&D Wizards of the Coast website. Use these for inspiration or to check your work.Digital character sheets can help you keep track of your characters on digital devices, like phones and tablets.

, Your character will be either male or female. Once you’ve determined gender, you’ll need to choose a race. There are seven basic races, though some players may allow other races to be used. Each race has certain unique characteristics, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. The seven basic races are:Dwarves. Short, stocky, stern, and strong. They have a connection to the earth and often live in mountains or underground lands. Stat modifiers: +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, –2 Charisma.

Elves. Tall, long-lived, aloof, and connected to nature. Elves live in harmony with the natural world around them. Stat modifiers: +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, –2 Constitution

Gnomes. Mysterious, adventure-seeking, and strange. Gnomes are the smallest common race. Stat modifiers: +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, –2 Strength.

Half-elves. Solitary, long-lived, graceful, and hearty. Half-elves are few in number, and tend to be wanderers due to their lack of homeland. Stat modifiers: +2 to one ability score

Half-orcs. Independent, strong, and distrusted. Half-orcs considered monstrosities by common folk. They are tall and powerfully built. Stat modifiers: +2 to one ability score

halflings. Optimistic, cheerful, curious, and small in stature. On average, only 3 ft (.9 m) tall, they are agile but physically weak. Stat modifiers: +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, –2 Strength

Humans. Adaptive, ambitious, and well-balanced. Humans are the dominant race, and are diverse in appearance and culture. Stat modifiers: +2 to one ability score, A character’s class is like their profession. If your character is starting from scratch at level one, you’ll also be level one in your class. As your character completes adventures, they’ll gain experience points (XP), which are used to raise your level and earn abilities and powers. There are 11 basic classes:



Barbarian. Uncivilized and strong. Considered brutal berserkers.

Bard. Charismatic and crafty. Bards use skills and spells to help and harm.
Cleric. A firm believer in a deity. Clerics heal, raise the dead, and direct the wrath of god.

Druid. At one with nature. Druids cast spells, interact with animals, and change shapes.

Fighter. Firm and brave. Fighters are capable with weapons and comfortable in armor.

Monk. Martial masters. Monks train their minds and bodies for offense and defense.

Paladin. Followers of what is good and just. Paladins are devoted knights.

Ranger. Masters of woodcraft and wildlife. Rangers track and hunt foes.

Rogue. Stealthy assassins. Rogues are cunning thieves and able scouts.

Sorcerer. Natural born spellcasters. Sorcerers command strange, ancient energies.

Wizard. Lifelong magic students. Years of study allow wizards to use awesome magic power., You might want a name that represents your class, like Jafar might for an evil wizard. In classic D&D, different races have names that reflect their culture and native language. Free name pools and generators can be found online with a search for the race, as in “gnome name generator” or “dwarf name pool.”Use name generators to get a feel for the kinds of names in your character’s race and come up with your own. Cycle through many names with the generator until you find one that suits your character.
Borrow names from your favorite video game, book, and comic characters. Use the name of your favorite historical figure.

, Every character is made up of six essential attributes. These are given scores, with high scores reflecting positive bonuses from that attribute and low scores penalties. A score of 10 in any attribute is considered to be average. The six attributes are:



Strength (Str). A measure of physical power. Important for combat characters, like fighters, monks, and paladins. Strength also dictates how much weight you can carry.

Dexterity (Dex). A measure of agility. This includes balance and reflexes. Important for rogues, light- to medium-armor wearing characters, and ranged attackers (like bow and sling users).

Constitution (Cons). A measure of health and fortitude. Constitution increases your character’s hit points, which if depleted, can result in fainting or death.

Intelligence (Int). A measure of knowledge. Important for wizards and classes requiring reason or learning, like paladins.

Wisdom (Wis). A measure of correct judgement. Wisdom contributes to common sense, awareness, and willpower. Important for clerics, druids, and rangers.

Charisma (Cha). A measure of magnetism. High charisma improves likability, appearance, and leadership ability. Important for bards, paladins, and sorcerers., You’ll need either four six-sided dice (4d6) or an online dice roller to do this. Online dice rollers can be found with a keyword search for “dice roller.” Roll all four dice. Add the three highest dice together and record this number. Repeat this until you have six recorded numbers., You can assign your recorded numbers any way you choose, but you’ll likely want to assign strong scores to attributes that are valuable to your class. Remember to add your racial stat modifiers to your total attribute scores.


To provide an example of a racial stat bonus: after rolling your ability scores, if you were a human, you’d get +2 points for any one attribute.
Use less dice when rolling ability scores to increase the difficulty of your D&D experience. 3d6 is often called “classic,” and only using 2d6 is termed “heroic.”, The Point Buy system allows you to buy attribute points for your character as you see fit. All attributes start out at an average score of 10. Each your ability score raises, the more the next ability point costs.


A low fantasy buying pool has 10 buy points, standard pool is 15, high is 20, and epic is 25.A snapshot of the ability point costs follows, with negative values counting as bonus buy points, but dropping that attribute to below average:

Ability Score / Point Cost

8 / -2
9 / -1
10 / 0
11 / 1
12 / 2
13 / 3
14 / 5

And so on…, There are ability score generators you can find and use online with a keyword search for “ability score generator.” There are also point buy calculators that can help you keep track of your point pool when buying ability points.


Many online ability score calculators and generators also factor in racial bonuses your character might have., The ability modifier is the bonus or penalty each ability score gives your character. For example, an ability score of 10 is average, so it has no bonuses or penalties (+0).


Modifier bonuses or penalties are added or subtracted to any activity requiring one of these main attributes.
Modifiers can also grant additional spells per day in an ability, if applicable. The following list provides some ability scores followed by their modifiers:

Score / Modifier

6 – 7 / -2
8 – 9 / -1
10 – 11 / +0
12 – 13 / +1
14 – 15 / +2
16 – 17 / +3, Skills are important basic abilities. You’ll find an extensive list of these on character sheets, including things like Acrobatics, Climb, Knowledge (history), Linguistics, Stealth, and more. Skills are earned by gaining levels by accumulating XP.


With each new level, your character gets skill ranks which are invested into specific skills, like Bluff, Sleight of Hand, or Swim.
Characters receive an automatic +3 bonus to class skills with at least one skill rank. These favored skills should be listed along with your character’s class description.
Your rank in a skill cannot be higher than your character’s number of hit dice (the number of dice used to determine your hit points)., Your character’s feats refer to abilities that aren’t linked their race, class, or skills. These include things like dodging reflex, a knack for fighting with bladed weapons, and natural skill with crafting items. Some feats have restrictions, like a minimum ability score or level. Many feats are oriented at improving class abilities or lessening class penalties. The main classes of feats are:Combat Feats. These allow your character to perform martial feats like All-consuming Swing, Ancestral Weapon Mastery, Bullseye Shot, Cleave, Dueling Mastery, and Improved Parry.Critical Feats. These feats can only be used when your character has a critical hit, which is generally indicated by a naturally rolled 20 with a 20-sided die.Item Creation Feats. These allow your character to create a certain kind of magic item, like scrolls, potions, and wands. These feats also generally require materials.Metamagic Feats. These influence either the effects of spells or the way in which they are cast. Some examples include Bouncing Spell, Concussive Spell, Lingering Spell, and Toxic Spell., Gold (GP), which is the currency of D&D, is usually awarded for completing quests and defeating enemies. However, each character starts with a pre-determined amount. This amount depends on your character’s class. Calculate your starting GP by calculating:


Barbarian, 3d6 x 10 GP
Bard, 3d6 x 10 GP
Cleric, 4d6 x 10 GP
Druid, 2d6 x 10 GP
Fighter, 5d6 x 10 GP
Monk, 1d6 x 10 GP
Paladin, 5d6 x 10 GP
Ranger, 5d6 x 10 GP
Rogue, 4d6 x 10 GP
Sorcerer, 2d6 x 10 GP
Wizard, 2d6 x 10 GP, Use gold to buy the starting weapons, armor, items (potions, torches), and equipment (tents, rope) for your character. Lists of items, weapons, and armor can be found online. In some games, you may only have simple weapons or armor available until you find a suitable shop where you can buy better ones.


Characters that are suited for the center of the action, like fighters and paladins, will likely need heavy armor, like plate mail and a shield, along with a weapon, like a broadsword or mace.
Characters that are agility based, like gnomes, rogues, and rangers, are better suited to light armor, like chainmail or boiled leather, and distance or sneak attack weapons, like a bow, sling, or a Kukri knife.
Frail characters, like many wizards and bards, may only be able to equip very light armor or robes. Weapons, too, are usually limited to light varieties, like rods, staves, bows, and whips., Weapon and armor bonuses will be listed along with the weapon and armor information. In some cases, like with very heavy weapons/armor, there may also be penalties. A high armor class (AC) will make your character more resistant to damage. Attack bonuses help you land damaging hits.


Use the following calculations to determine your AC and attack bonuses:

AC = 10 + armor bonus + shield bonus + Dexterity Modifier + other modifiers (like racial or class)
Melee attack bonus = base attack bonus + Strength Modifier + size modifier
Ranged attack bonus = base attack bonus + Dexterity Modifier + size modifier + range penalty (if any)


Size modifiers are determined according to the following scale: Colossal (-8), Gargantuan (-4), Huge (-2), Large (-1), Medium (+0), Small (+1), Tiny (+2), Diminutive (+4), Fine (+8). Small characters are generally more agile, whereas large ones are generally strong., Feel free to do this in a drawing or with words. Include basic physical features like age, weight, height, skin color, and more. Think of your character’s personality, which will influence the decisions they make in the game.


Write a backstory for your character. What was their young life like? This will give you a better sense of the character as separate from yourself, which will help with role-playing later.
Goals, fears, and desires can add depth to your character. Keep these in mind as you play your character and interact with other players and non-player characters (NPCs)., Alignment is a measure of moral attitude. There are nine basic alignments which encompass a range of personalities, philosophies, and beliefs. Alignment consists of one order characteristic (Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic) and one moral characteristic (Good, Neutral, Evil), as in lawful-neutral, lawful-evil, neutral-good, and chaotic-good.



Good characters are driven to protect innocence and life. Good sacrifices for others and cares for the dignity of sentient creatures.

Evil characters undermine or harm life. Evil hurts, harms, and oppresses, usually for fun or personal gain.

Morally neutral characters avoid killing, but usually lack a sense of obligation to sacrifice for or protect others.

Lawful characters respect order, truth, authority, and tradition. They are often closed-minded, overly rigid, and self-righteous.

Chaotic characters make decisions according to their conscience. They resent authority and love freedom, though they can be reckless and irresponsible.

Order neutral characters are generally honest, but susceptible to temptation. They feel neither a need to obey orders or rebel., Join other players so you can play your character in a campaign decided or created by your dungeon master. Sample campaigns and resources can be found online, but so long as you have access to a core rulebook, you can create your own D&D world.


For those who are brand new to D&D, dungeon masters are the coordinators of the game. They describe setting, control non-player characters, and design dungeons for characters to overcome."
"
First off, know your campaign setting - is it Forgotten Realms™?,
Now that you know those things, you can think of a rough idea of what you want this dungeon to be like.,
Now that you know that, you should start on the dungeon creation.,
Build some settlements (at least one) relatively near the dungeon.,
Think up maybe two notable NPCs in the village - people that the PCs can refer to when asking ""so-what-are-we-supposed-to-watch-out-for?"",
Next, draw a map of your dungeon.,
Now, choose which monsters you want for the first three ""musts."",
Now that you've chosen your monsters, place them in the dungeon and write up their stats.,
Now, choose the treasure.,
Now that you have done this, figure out the leftovers.,
Now, find a group of players, schedule a time and place, and play.

",How to Create a Dungeon in D&D," Is it Eberron™? Is it Greyhawk™? Or is it even a campaign setting that you thought up yourself? Well, whatever it may be, be sure you are aware of where the PC's are starting out, what the climate and overall environment in that area is, and most of all, what level they are! Being a DM, you should know these kind of things right off the bat, so you don't have to worry about doing incredible research to learn them.;
, Some examples might be an underwater adventure where they must learn the secret to where the Wand of Orcus is, an extermination mission where they venture into the city's sewer system to wipe out the thieves' guild there, or a flat-out dungeon crawl. I'd suggest the dungeon crawl for beginners because it requires little story or role-playing on your part (assuming that handling NPCs will be challenging for you in the beginning stages of DMdom). Anyway, a dungeon crawl is basically just your average dungeon with random monsters plaguing its caverns, a few random traps, and some random treasure. It may sound difficult with all of this ""random"" stuff, but it is actually very simple.

, The first thing you want to do is write a short and sweet backstory about how this particular dungeon came to be. Is it an abandoned dwarven city? Is it a forgotten Kobold mine? Both of those are widely used, so see if you can think of something a little unique and interesting before resorting to the cliché path. Keep in mind where this dungeon is geographically positioned, though - you wouldn't have an magmin-infested tunnel complex in the arctic wastes of Arthaenor , now, would you?

, This will come in handy to the players, who can restock on weapons and equipment there, heal there, and most of all, get their magic-items identified there! : )

, type questions. You don't need every bit of personality worked out the NPCs. Just enough so that you know what their occupation is and a rough idea of what their disposition is.

, Grid paper is recommended, since in combat, you play on a ""battle-grid."" I've found that I like 4-to-an-inch paper or 10-to-an-inch paper, but that's just me. Use whatever size grid paper you want. Also keep in mind the size of your dungeon when choosing grid paper. Here are some things that all dungeon crawls have: at least 1 encounter with 3 or more weak monsters. At least 1 encounter with a not-too-tough-and-not-to-easy monster. At least 1 encounter with a ""boss monster"" that will be the final challenge in the dungeon. At least one trap or locked door that the rogue or bard can disable or pick. At least a total treasure of 100 GP per party level per party player (i.e. for a group of 5 4th-level characters, reward each of them 400 GP). At least a total treasure of one magic item per party member (if they are above first level. If they are first level, just give them non-magical items, such as masterwork weapons, precious stones, and perhaps some platinum pieces. These 6 ""musts"" are essential to any dungeon. However, don't overdo it on the treasure. That is a mistake that many fledgling DMs make.

, For the weak encounter, an average battle will be the players against 3 Kobolds or goblins. For the medium encounter, a few orcs or a medium monstrous spider will do the trick. And for the ""boss"" encounter, a choker or phantom fungus will do. This is all assuming that the characters are first level. If they are higher, you should have tougher monsters.

, You don't need to write out every single thing in their entry in the Monster Manual - just their basic combat stats (i.e. special abilities, AC, HP, attacks, saves, speed, initiative, etc.).

, You should put it in a hard-to-reach spot (such as behind a secret door, or even guarded by the boss monster). For a party of 4 first level characters, an average treasure hoard would be 300 GP, two 50 GP gems, a masterwork battleaxe, and four potions of Cure Light Wounds for later adventures.

, Are there any locked doors? If so, what are the Open Lock DCs? Are there any secret doors? If so, what are the Search DCs? Are there any traps? If so, what are the effects of the traps? What are their Search and Disable Device DCs? Are there any other noteworthy features of your dungeon? These are the kind of things you should do at the end of dungeon creation.

Lawful Neutral.,

Neutral Evil.,
Chaotic Evil.",How to Choose and Correctly Role Play Your Alignment in Dungeons and Dragons V3.5," In the real world morality is nothing but a sea of gray, however in D&D everything is very clear cut. Evil people consider themselves evil and enjoy being that way.;
, Everyone gets the good/evil axis but not everyone understands the law/chaos axis. Nearly everyone understands the description ""lawful"" but there is a lot of confusion when it comes to ""chaotic"". Being of a chaotic alignment does not mean that your character is random in their actions. Try to think of chaotic as the opposite of lawful as evil is the opposite of good. Chaotic in D&D alignments means independent, free, and distrustful of authority. These characters are the type of people who resent being told what to do.

, Lawful good characters have a strict moral code, usually coinciding with societal mores, and they almost never break it. They favor order, structure, and upright behavior. They will desire to help others when the opportunity presents itself, unless doing so would conflict with their moral code. These characters would not break the law except in very rare circumstances. They do not feel that the ends ever justify the means. A ""by the book"" cop is an example of a real life lawful good person.

, Neutral good characters always do what is good, right, or helpful which is why this alignment is sometimes called True Good. Unlike lawful good characters they are more flexible in their day to day actions. A neutral good character would consider bending the rules to do what is right. A doctor who fudges paperwork to help a needy person get health insurance is a neutral good person.

, These people want to do what is right but they do not do it with any real structure or system. They are perfectly willing to break the law to do what is right, and some even enjoy doing just that. The best time to play a chaotic good character is when there is a lawful evil authority to rebel against. Without such a target for a rebellion many chaotic good characters are indistinguishable from neutral good characters. A hacker who uses his skills to take down child pornography sites is chaotic good, willfully breaking the law to do good. Robin Hood is the most famous example of chaotic good.

, Lawful neutral people tend to be dispassionate and calculating. They have a set of behavioral guidelines but these guidelines allow for some good and some evil behavior. A lawful neutral character tends to care a lot more about the letter of the law than the spirit. An ideal judge would be lawful neutral, making all rulings based on the letter of the law without an eye towards helping or hurting others or their personal feelings.

, Neutral characters are hard to play because they lack defining moral values. This is essentially a person who evaluates each situation independently and makes a decision, but the criteria might be different in each different situation. If you play this alignment you must balance all your decisions on both the law/chaos and good/evil axis. A true neutral person in real life is almost unheard of.

, Chaotic neutral is the ultimate free spirit. This character essentially does what they want when they want regardless of whether or not it is good or evil, legal or not. Chaotic Neutral is sometimes referred to as ""evil light"" because many people feel it borders on evil without technically being evil. Most antiheroes in fiction and literature are Chaotic Neutral.

, Lawful evil characters are in essence, tyrants or dictators. They have a code of laws that is generally oppressive and brutally enforced. Lawful evil characters do not tolerate anyone questioning their authority, nor will they share their authority. A lawful evil character is out for personal gain, but is more given to scheming and intimidation than to random bloodshed. Don Corleone is one example, although there certainly are others who are more evil.

, Neutral evil characters are essentially pure evil. They do not follow any set of laws, nor are they concerned with obtaining power. They tend to be the kind of people who enjoy hurting others. They are not concerned with the law in the slightest. Serial killers are often neutral evil.

, Chaotic evil characters are psychopaths. They do not care for anything but themselves. They kill indiscriminately and for fun. They can only be controlled by threats and force and will probably kill anyone who controls them the moment they think they can. Chaotic evil characters are almost always solitary. The latest incarnation of the Joker would be a prime example.

The second is that if you are going to play D&D you will want to play with at least one current friend. Contrary to popular belief D&D is a social game and people who play it are social people. The people you play this game with shape the experience so it's best if you play with people you like and get along with.;
, Again, D&D is a social game. It is played in a group and if people in that group don't show up to play then it can hurt the game. D&D works best when all people involved can be counted on to play. Does this mean you need to set aside hours out of every day? No, but you do need to be willing to commit to playing when your group plays. If you cannot come to most sessions, you should not play with that group. D&D also requires a small amount of time on the part of each player outside of the group sessions. You may need to do things such as decide how your character will spend his money or level up your character.

, Do you enjoy other RPGs? Do you like fantasy or science fiction novels? Do you play World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy? People who answer yes to any of these questions might like D&D. D&D can also be fun for a creative person because it provides a way to practice developing fictional characters. Writers and actors often enjoy D&D.

, D&D can be played for free or very near to it. However, you will find it is easier and a little more fun if you invest a small amount of money into the game. A set of dice for D&D (about $3) and a used copy of the Player's Handbook ($10-$30 depending on source and condition) will make playing easier and more fun. You can spend a lot more if you want but it is not needed to have a good time.

, If you know some people who play D&D you should try to go to one of their games to see a session. You should ask the person who runs the game (the Dungeon Master) and the person hosting the game. These two are not always the same person, i.e Bob is the Dungeon Master but the group plays in Tom's house.

, For people in junior high school and high school it can cause problems for your social life if people find out that you play D&D. There is a lot of prejudice surrounding people who play D&D and it can result in bullying. If being popular is very important to you, or if you cannot tolerate your peers teasing you then you may want to stay away from D&D. Truthfully though, learning to deal with narrow mindedness is an important lesson that D&D teaches many people who play.

, Many objects can be used for many things, but many have a sole purpose. That purpose could be as small as rigging a card game or as big as protecting an entire race., That would allow the players to understand why an object does what it does. Also it would allow the players to know what might the item look and feel like., Usually very powerful items can be destroyed in a certain way, some harder than others. If you cannot think of a way, a very iconic way of destroying something is drowning it in the River Styx., Magic comes in all different sources, and can change an object into a more lethal weapon. The object might be a simple +1 damage to even opening a rift between worlds. You can find inspiration in ""Dungeon Master's Guide"" (5th Edition) 142-227., You can add simple spells like ""Magic Missile"" or ""Crown of Madness"". However, when adding spells that require a saving throw, you must decide what the Difficulty Class the spell is., Most items that have spells use a system called ""charges"". This means that an item would have a maximum charge that replenishes (Usually every dawn or day). A spell would cost a certain amount of charges to cast. Some times the item might not recharge at all, and you can only cast it a certain amount of time., Determine these as you would determine a player stat (Rolling 4 6-sided dice, dropping the lowest roll and adding up the rest)., As a sentient item, it must be able to communicate. This is up to you either if and object communicates telepathically or verbally., When using these sense make sure it has a maximum vision and hearing range. A sentient object can also have dark vision if you wish., As a sentient object, it must have a moral compass on things., Give it quirky charm and human characteristics. After all, wouldn't want the player tossing this away. However, as like an NPC it has demands as well like blood or loyalty to a race.

Nc3 Bb4


Nc3 - Again a logical move, white is now covering the pawn on e4 and has developed another piece.",How to Win Chess Openings: Playing Black1,"
e6 - Moving the king pawn a conservative one space forward is the defining move of the French Defense. Although it does not control the centre squares as e4 does, it can lead to many strong positions.
Nimzovich in the book, ""My System"" made a case that the best ploy by white was to move d4 on the second move and e5 on the third move and go for a space advantage and an attack on the king. Because of this, most players will play this way as white and this gives black the first attack on the queenside starting with 2) ... d5 and 3) ... c5, the Advance Variation.;
,
D5 - Moving the Queen Pawn two spaces forward now forms a strong pawn chain(both the Classical and Winawer Variation of the French Defense complete this move).

C5 - Moving the Queen Bishop pawn two spaces forward is defining move of the Sicilian Defence. This aggressive first move is strong, because if an exchange occurs with white's queen pawn, than black's centre pawns still remain in play, while black is structurally weak. This move also avoids symmetry with white.

, The main advantage of this move is it clears the king side pieces in order to perform an early kingside castle. It is also strong as it controls one of the centre squares.
D6 - This logical move forms a pawn chain and stops e5 chasing the knight

, Learn all the rules of chess and make sure to use the abilities of each piece to their fullest. The best example is ""castling,"" which is one of the most effective ways to protect your king.


To castle you move your king two squares to the left or right of its starting position and in the same move jump your rook from the corner square to the square on the king's opposite side.
You can only castle if the king and rook have not yet moved in the game.
There have to be no pieces between the king and rook.
You can not castle if the king is in check or will go into check because of the move.

, Try to make the best move you can each time you move a piece. Consider these questions:Does this move put my piece in a better position than it is in now?
Would moving a different piece instead put me in a better position overall?
If there are any pieces in danger of being taken by your opponent, does your move defend against the threat?
Would the move put your piece in danger from one of your opponent's pieces?
Once you decide on a good move, stop and look for a better move.

, After every move your opponent makes, take time to think about their move. Why did she choose that move?Try to figure out your opponent's overall plan and how the move fits into it.
Look for any of your pieces that are threatened. Can your opponent take one of your pieces on the next move? If so consider making a move to prevent it.

, Deciding each move as you go along will only get you so far.Use your pieces in harmony. Think about ways to attack over the course of a few moves using more than one piece.
Encircle your opponent's king with a few pieces. Attacking with only one piece at a time will make it easy for your opponent to defend.
Try using several pieces to control an entire section of the board. Position pieces so that your opponent cannot move in that section without being attacked.

, The player who gets things moving and formulates a plan of attack can control the game and get the other play on the defensive.Don't just move pawns at the beginning. Bring out your stronger pieces too.

, The player who has control of the four squares at the center of the board will often be able to do better.Pieces in the center of the board can move in more directions and to more locations than pieces off to the side.
Pieces in the center of the board can get to other parts of the board more quickly than pieces at the edges, which would have to cross the center to get to the other side of the board.

, While working to attack your opponent don't forget to keep your own king safe.Keep your king in a safe place, such as behind a few pawns which you try not to move away.
Castling puts your king in a very safe position behind pawns if you have not moved them out yet.

, If you are at an advantage work your way to a checkmate by eliminating your opponents pieces. It may be tempting to push your advantage by trying to get a checkmate right away, but the fewer pieces that are on the board the easier it will be to end the game.Trading even value pieces will hurt your opponent more than it will hurt you if you are ahead.
Eliminating pieces simplifies the board and makes it easier to trap your opponent.

, Many chess games end with similar pieces left on the board. Learn the classic ways to put your opponent in checkmate using particular combinations of pieces.


King And Queen vs Lonely King

Mating With Bishop And Knight
Research more complicated endings too. You can find lists of endings for different combinations of pieces at this website.


, Saving pawns for the end is very important because if you can cross a pawn all the way to the last row of your opponent's side of the board you can promote it to any piece (except a king).Promote your pawn to a queen because the queen is the strongest piece.
Try not to let your opponent's pawns get promoted.

, Even if you feel you are close to winning don't stop paying close attention to each move you make and each move your opponent makes. Stay on the lookout for attacks., Sign up for local chess tournaments to get a chance to try out your strategies and to watch other players.

However, the rest of your pieces are not easily dispensed cannon fodder. Based on the math and geometry of a chess board, certain pieces are always more valuable than others. Remember these rankings when taking pieces. You do not, for example, want to put a high-value Rook at risk just to take an opponent's Knight.


Pawn = 1 point
Knight = 3 points
Bishop = 3 points
Rook = 5 points
Queen = 9Chess pieces are sometimes referred to as ""material."" You want a lot of high-quality material to win each game.;
, Chess openings are the first couple of moves in the game, and they will determine your general strategy and positioning for the entire match. Your goal when opening is to develop, or move off of the starting squares, as many strong pieces as possible. There are several key considerations in a good opening:Move your pawns toward the center of the board, while opening up your stronger pieces for easy movement. The most common yet very efficient path would be to move the king's pawn 2 paces forward and then the queen's pawn forward 2 paces, if it is not at risk after the opponent makes his move. This opening develops bishops, increases castling speed and with the right moves forms a defensive but less offensive fortress.
Your opening moves will also be dependent on whether you are black or white. Since White moves first, you'll want to move in on attack and try and control the game. Black should hold back and wait a bit more, letting white expose themselves with a mistake before attacking.
Never move the same piece twice, unless it gets in trouble and could be taken. The more pieces you can move, the more your opponent needs to react to you.
Keeping these principles in mind, check out the list of opening moves used by Grandmasters at modern tournaments.

, To win at chess, you need to be constantly thinking a few moves in advance, setting up longer, more complicated attacks to outfox your opponent. Your first move is about setting up the rest of the game, leading to your first attack or controlling certain sections of the board. The best way for a beginner to learn how to plan ahead is to practice some common opening combinations:


The Ruy Lopez is a classic opening to get bishops out and attacking. Move your King's Pawn up two spaces, then your Knight up F3 (as white). Finish by pushing your King's Bishop all the way until it is one space in front of the opponent's pawn.The English Opening is a slow, adaptable opening. Move the C2 pawn up 1, then follow with the G2 Pawn to free your King's Bishop (if black moves to the center) or the Queen's Knight, (if black moves along the sides).Try the adventurous King's Gambit. Used by Grandmasters from Bobby Fisher onward, this exciting opening can put beginners off-balance early. Simply move both King Pawns (E2 & F2) up two spaces with the opening move. Black will frequently attack early, feeling like they have you opened up, but your pawn wall will quickly cause them problems.Try the Queen’s Gambit to control the center of the board. White move the Queen’s Pawn to d4 drawing out black’s pawn to d5. White typically retaliates with Bishop’s Pawn to c4. This maneuver brings the game out to the center and opens up the lanes for your Queen and Bishop to move.A good defense to a Queen’s Gambit is the French Defense. As black, start by moving your King’s Pawn to e6. White will typically then move his Queen’s Pawn to d4, allowing you to retaliate with your Queen’s Pawn to d5. You’ve now opened up a path for your Bishop to attack. If White takes your Queen’s Pawn at e6, he leaves his King exposed, so he may move his Knight to c3. You can now move your Bishop to b4, pinning the Knight.



, This trick only works once per player, as a savvy chess player will spot the move and get out of the way. That said, Scholar's Mate is a great way to catch a beginner opponent off guard and snag the game from them quickly.



As White: King's Pawn moves up 1 (E7-E6); King's Bishop to C5; Queen to F6; Queen to F2.

As Black: King's Pawn up 1 (E2-E3); King's Bishop to C4; Queen to F3, Queen to F7.Countering Scholar's Mate: Pull your Knights out as blockades if you see Scholar's Mate happening-- chances are good they won't sacrifice a Queen just to take your Knight. The other option is to use a nearly identical move, but instead of pushing your Queen up, leave her back on E7, in front of your King.

, Your biggest concern when playing chess is controlling the center tiles, specifically the four in the very middle. This is because you can attack anywhere from the center of the board, allowing you to control the pace and direction of the game. The Knight, for example, has eight potential moves in the center of the board, but only 1-2 on the edges. There are two general ways to do this.



Supported Middle is when you move slowly into the center of the board with several pieces. Knights and Bishops support from the fringes, able to move in and take pieces if you get under attack. In general, this slow development is more common.

Using the Flanks is a very modern style of play that controls the middle from the outsides. Your Rooks, Queen, and Knights run up both sides of the board, making it impossible for your opponent to move into the middle without being taken.

, Once you’ve made the opening moves, it’s time to start developing an attacking position. You want to give each of your pieces the best possible square to move to, getting pieces off of the starting squares.Unless you are forced to, the best method is to move your pieces in turn. Don’t move the same piece twice unless you must defend it from an unexpected attack or make a vital attack.
You don’t have to move each piece, however. Advancing all of your pawns won’t help you win as it breaks down a vital line of defense protecting your King.

, Castling is when your hop the King over a Rook, effectively using the Rook to form a wall against attack. Above the King you still have a line of pawns protecting you as well. This is an incredibly effective tactic, especially for beginners learning the game. To do it:


Clear the path between your King and Rook by moving the Bishop and Knight (and potentially Queen). Try to keep as many pawns as you can in place. You can do this on either side.
In the same turn, move the Rook and King together, where they meet, swap their positions. So, if you're castling on the King's side, you would end up with the King on G1 and the Rook on F1.Note that the King and the Rook can not have moved once before castling. If they do, the move is no longer allowed.
Part of what helps you to win at chess is your ability to read your opponent without letting him read you. Don’t begin your move until you are sure it the right move.
You want to be thinking several moves ahead at all times. This means knowing where each of your pieces can move in any situation and being able to predict how your opponent will react to your moves. This skill isn’t always easy to gain and will take practice.

, What pieces are they developing, and what sides of the board are they favoring? If you were them, what sort of long-term strategy would you be planning? Once you have the basics of your own play down, you should be constantly adjusting to your opponent's. If she's holding back, setting up pieces near her side for an attack, ask yourself what her end-goal is. Are there ways you can disrupt or put her plan on hold? Does he have the advantage, and do you need to fall back and defend some units to prevent a serious loss of material, or can you put some pressure on him?, Trading pieces is obvious when you end up with the material advantage, such as giving up a Knight in order to get their Queen, but it is much trickier when you're trading off similar pieces. In general, you do not want to trade pieces when:


You have the advantage in position, center control, and development. The fewer pieces are on the board in total, the less of an advantage you have and the easier you are to defend against.
The opponent is cramped or stuck in a corner. When you have them locked in it is more difficult for them to move or maneuver many pieces, but fewer pieces can get them out of the jam and free again.
You have fewer pieces than your opponent. If you have more pieces than them and the advantages are otherwise similar, start taking pieces. You'll open up new attacking lanes.
You would double up pawns. A doubled pawn is when you have one pawn in front of the other. This makes them both much less useful and clogs up your side of the board. However, if you can make your opponent double pawns as a side-effect of an even trade then this could be useful move., It is easier said than done, but you need to be thinking long-term in order to win chess games with any regularity. Each piece you move should be done with three common goals in mind. If you keep these points in your head, you'll find you can easily start improvising multi-move plans to win the game:


Develop multiple pieces (Rooks, Knights, Queen, Bishop) early and often. Get them out of their starting spots to open up your options.
Control the center. The center of the board is where the action happens.
Protect the King. You can have the best offense in the world, but leaving your King open is a sure-fire way to lose at the last minute., Chess is about momentum, and if you have it, you need to keep it. If your opponent is purely reacting to you, moving pieces out of the way frequently and unable to mount any attack, take your time and whittle them down. Remember, you can win a match-up and still lose the game. Don't move in if you're opening up to a counter attack. Instead, pick off their defending pieces, take full control of the middle of the board, and wait to hit them until it really hurts.

, Pinning is when you trap a piece or hold it hostage, keeping your opponent from effectively using it without losing the piece. This passive sort of warfare is a great way to control the game, and it will help you master your opponents. To do it, look where a piece can move. Usually, pieces with limited options are your best bet. Then, instead of attacking, position your piece so that you could take them no matter where the move, effectively making the piece useless for a period of time.


Taking hostages is when you give your opponent the opportunity to take your piece. The only catch is knowing that you can take their piece right back. They may take it, they may not -- the important thing is that you're in control., You need to be looking at the entire board, evaluating every possible move you have. Don't make a move just because you have to -- take the time instead to look for the best possible move every turn. What makes a good move depends purely on context, but there are a few questions you can ask yourself before every move to see if it is the right one:


Am I safer than where I was before?
Do I expose this piece, the King, or another important piece?
Can the enemy quickly put my piece in danger, making me move back and ""lose"" a turn?
Does this move put the enemy under pressure to react to me?, You want to maintain control of the center, but you also want to attack as a unit. Your pieces are like the parts of orchestra, they each serve a unique purpose, but work the best together. By eliminating your opponent’s pieces you have a greater chance at putting his King in check without a piece to hide behind, and by doing it with 2-3 units as support you ensure that you keep the advantage in material., It is the most powerful piece on the board for a reason, and there are rarely good times to trade it in for an opponent's piece, even their Queen. Your Queen is your most versatile attacker and needs to be used as such. Always protect and support the Queen, as the most players will sacrifice just about any piece (other than their own Queen) to take her down.


Queens only reach their full potential with support. Most players instinctively watch the opponent's Queen, so use yours to force pieces into the line of your Rooks, Bishops, and Knights., Bishops strike from long-range, and using the two of them to control the board is vital, especially in the early game. There are many opening strategies that you can learn, but the overall goal is to quickly open up space for your higher value pieces to move freely.


Moving your Pawns to either d4/d5, or e4/e5 opens up your Bishops to move and helps you claim the center squares. Get the bishops out early and use their long range to your advantage while developing Rook and the Queen., A game of chess is generally considered to have three stages, all of which are deeply linked. The best chess players are always 10-12 moves ahead in their brain, developing 3-4 strategies simultaneously depending on the moves of their opponent. They know that moves and pieces traded in the early stages will profoundly affect the end of the game, and they plan accordingly.



Opening: This is where you set the tone of the game. Your first 4-5 moves develop a lot of pieces quickly and begin fighting for the center of the board. You can go offensive, taking the fight to them, or defensive, holding back and waiting to for them to make the first move.

The Midgame: This exists purely to set up your endgame. You trade pieces, seize control of the middle of the board and set up 1-2 lines of attack that you can spring into motion at any time. A trade-off now may be beneficial, but you have to know how losing a piece effects your chances to win at the end.

Endgame: There are only a few pieces left, and they are all incredibly valuable. The Endgame seems like it is the most dramatic stage, but really most of the work has already been done -- the player who ""won"" the Midgame and ended up with the best material should wrap it up with checkmate.

, Early on, Bishops and Knights are roughly even strength. In the Endgame, however, Bishops can quickly move across the entire, much emptier board, while Knights are still slow. Remember this when trading pieces -- the Bishop may not help as much in the short-term, but they'll be an asset at the end.

, Pawns may seem useless, but they are critical pieces as the game winds down. They can support stronger pieces, push up the board to create pressure, and are a wonderful shield for your King. This benefit, however, is lost if you start doubling them early on (put two pawns in the same vertical line). Keep your pawns close together and let them support each other horizontally. When there are very few pieces left on the board, a push upward to promote into a Queen can win you the game.

, If you're down material, and you know you have no chance of getting checkmate with what you have left, it's time to push for the draw. In competitive chess, you need to realize when you've lost the chance to win (you're down to a King, a pawn, and maybe 1-2 other pieces, they have you on the run, etc.) and should instead go for a tie. There are several ways to cut your loses and grab a draw, even when things seem hopeless:



Perpetual Check is when you force the opponent into a position where they cannot avoid going into check. Note, you don't actually have them in checkmate, you just have them in a position where they are not in check, but cannot move in a way that doesn't put them in check. Frequently done with a last-ditch attack on the King, leaving the opponent stuck between attack and defense.

Stalemating: When a King is not in check, but cannot move without going into check. Since a player cannot willingly enter check, the game is a draw.

Repetition or Useless Moves: If 50 moves have occurred without a piece being captured or a player in check, you can ask for a draw. If both players only make the same exact move 3 times in a row (because they are forced to move back and forth) it is also a draw.

Lack of material. There are a few scenarios where winning is physically impossible:

Just two Kings on the board.
King and Bishop against a King
King and Knight against a King
King and two Knights against a King., You can vastly increase your chess skills without ever facing an opponent. Chess problems are sample boards that ask you to get checkmate with just 1 or 2 moves. You can practice on 100's of them in books, against any computer (the one with Windows 7 has 10 levels), or online, and over time you'll start to learn great piece positions and unexpectedly sneaky modes of attack. While you will, more likely than not, never see the exact situation on the board, chess problems develop your ability to see all potential angles of attack and how to best set up pieces.Look online for problem sets, or check out a book on chess strategy at the library, as they will all have practice problems.

Begin with your pawn from e2 to e4.,
Move your queen from d1 to h5.,
Move your bishop at f1 to c4.,
Move your queen to f7 and declare checkmate.",How to Use the Scholar's Mate in Chess1," A classic move which many starting strategies include, moving that pawn opens up your queen and bishop for use. The key to the scholar’s mate is tempting your opponent with the seemingly careless use of your own queen. Provided they respond with certain predictable moves, you can perform the shortest checkmate possible for white.








Ideally you’ll be playing against a beginner, as the scholar’s mate is a fairly noticeable strategy; the moves even owe their namesake to their usefulness for new learners playing against others who are learning.
The first desired response will be for your opponent to move his pawn to e5. This opens the black queen, king and bishop to capture.;
, As stated, the queen is the centerpiece of the offensive strategy of the scholar’s mate. In fact it is the only piece that moves twice in this short, four-turn checkmate. The queen’s movement here will prompt a response from your opponent which will only draw him closer to checkmate.










The feint here is to draw your opponent’s attention to the pawn now in danger of being captured by your queen.
The response which the scholar’s mate requires is for the opponent to move his knight to c6, to cover for a potentially captured pawn.

, While not an obvious move at first (an advantage for yourself), the bishop’s movement here is setting up for the eventual checkmate. It will cover f7, where the white queen will move next to complete the checkmate. Fortunately this move seems weak out of context; it doesn’t threaten any unprotected pieces nor does it set up an obvious play.








For the scholar’s mate to continue smoothly, your opponent should play his other knight from g8 to f6, in anticipation of taking your unprotected pawn at e5.

, With this the trap is set and sprung. The queen is adjacent to your opponent’s king, and the king himself cannot capture the queen without moving into check. Sit back and enjoy your victory, and perhaps share with your opponent the quick and deadly scholar’s mate.









"
"
Respond to the opening move.,
Play your knight to c6.,
Play your pawn to g6.,
Move your knight to f6.,
Continue the game.",How to Use the Scholar's Mate in Chess2," If you’re especially wary of the scholar’s mate, or know for certain that it is something your opponent will attempt, you can use the french defense by responding with a pawn to e6. By not extending the pawn to e5 you close down any defense the white’s bishop would have provided for the white queen.








Responding with the french defense will shut down any scholar’s mate, but it will force you to use more advance techniques going forward. For beginners it’s recommended to respond as expected, with a pawn to e5.
Reacting as you know your opponent would like you to is generally very useful, as it places them under a false sense of security, distracting them from considering other options.

, Continue to play into the scholar’s mate as a continuation of the feint. In any case, playing another more interruptive move would leave your pawn defenseless at e5. Positioning your knight in this case is just as much about protecting that pawn as it is about baiting the scholar’s mate.









, If your opponent continues with the scholar’s mate, they would have moved their bishop to c4 in response to the previous move. Alternatively your opponent might delay their strategy a bit by moving their pawn to c4 instead. In either case, moving your pawn to g6 will effectively disable the four-move scholar’s mate.










Moving your pawn to g6 blocks the white queen’s path forward. Your opponent can no longer take your pawn at f7 and thus you avoid the checkmate entirely.

, The conventional response to the previous step will be for your opponent to withdraw their queen to f3. After this move, your pawn at f7 will be threatened both by the opposing queen and bishop at c4. Bringing your knight forward for defense is the safest way to protect this pawn.








Your queen will cover your knight from capture by the opponent’s queen, and your pawn is safe from their bishop, who would now be undefended if it tried to perform a capture.

, Once your opponent’s scholar’s mate has been disabled, they’ll be at a general disadvantage as they’ve set their board for a certain strategy that has failed. In general once you’ve avoided the scholar’s mate you’ll have considerable control of the game.

Consider castling your king shortly after moving your knight to f6. Strengthening your defense is a strategic choice when your opponent has over-committed to an opening strategy.

""Know thyself."",
Now that you understand your own mind better,turn that laser-like understanding on your opponent.,
Use three threats in a row.,
Take ten moves to do what you could do in two.,
Surprise your opponent.,
Use fake outs over the board.,
Older players tend to rely on their knowledge of positional chess and they play a tough opening and a tough ending.,
If you are a very young player, you will not be able to play the ending very well so play gambits where you sacrifice a pawn to get an attack and this usually decides the game long before the ending.

",How to Use Psychology to Win Chess Games," This famous Latin aphorism is as true in chess as in life. In fact, the truth you learn about yourself through examining your score sheet after a game and asking yourself, ""What on earth was I thinking?"" and actually trying to answer the question will give you insights into your character defects on and off the board.


Did you refuse to accept a draw against a lower rated player, only to lose instead? Pride goes before the fall.
Did you get overconfident and stop paying attention, only to lose your queen?
Did you become needlessly afraid and react to threats that weren't there?
Were you too lazy to calculate? Answer these questions as well as you can as you go through your score sheet, and make sure you add these to your overall understanding of your chess mistakes.;
, If you're really good at reading people, you can even try to use what you observe. But in general, this means taking advantage of flaws we all have. Laziness. No-one wants to work harder than they need to. So try to make your threats invisible.


A good example of hiding your threats is to make sure that when your opponent asks himself, ""Why did he move there?"" he has an easy answer available. Good threats are moves that answer threats, and make threats of their own. ""Why did he move his bishop there? Oh, to defend the knight that I'm attacking."" And many a player will stop right there, satisfied that he has answered the question, and too lazy to bother asking whether there could be another reason. The stronger the player, the harder they will work.

, Chess coach and Life Master Brian Wall used to say that Patzers (or weak chess players) collapse after three threats in a row. Three threats, and they get tired of being on the defense, and begin to giving up psychologically. It works like magic. There's something about the number three.

, This makes your opponent begin to lose his caution. He finds no meaning in your last six moves, and gives up looking. Make sure these meaningless moves are done in safe positions and are not giving him the opportunity to create problems for you.

, Sometimes even an unsound piece sacrifice can win just due to the shock value. That doesn't mean you should make unsound sacrifices, but one of the reasons overly aggressive players often win is that they have succeeded in intimidating their opponents and rattling them into unsound defense. Keep in mind that this in particular is also true in life. People bluster and act intimidating, refuse to believe them. Remain objective.

, This includes not looking at the part of the board you're actually thinking about, pretending to concentrate when your opponent has forgotten to hit the clock so that he doesn't notice his time running, as a few examples of this kind of cheap bluffing. In a game as intense as chess sometimes we can be affected by unconscious clues and gestures.

, If you play a closed positional/space game they will defeat you easily. Try to open up the position and get them into a game that is all ""Tactics"" because this is where they break down and make mistakes in calculations or they just ""miss"" seeing a few threats.

Explain the chess board.,
Begin teaching the pieces.,
Continue explaining the pieces.,
Place all the pieces on the board.",How to Teach Children Chess1," A chess board has 8 rows and 8 columns. There are 64 squares total. Half of the squares are a light color and half of the squares are a dark color.If you do not have a chess board, you can draw one on a dry erase board or chalk board.


If you are teaching in a classroom, it may help to number the horizontal squares from 1 to 8, and letter the vertical squares from “a” to “h.” You can then use a coordinate system while you are teaching.;
, Explain the pawns, knights, rooks, bishops, king, and queen. Note the differences in how each piece looks. Place the pieces on the board so the child can see the proper position.The knight usually looks like a horse.
The bishop looks like a hat.
The king is the most important piece because the object of the game is to capture the opponent’s king.
Point out the difference in the shape of the queen and king pieces
Rooks are also called castles.

, Go through each piece and explain how each piece moves on the board. Make sure the child understands a piece before you move on to the next.


A pawn can move two spaces from its starting position, but only one space after that. A pawn can only capture a piece when it moves diagonally and can never move backwards.
A knight is the only piece that can jump over another piece. It moves in an “L” shape. It can move 2 spaces horizontally and then one space vertically, or it can move 2 spaces vertically and then one space horizontally.
The bishop can move diagonally and any number of squares.
Rooks can move any number of squares forwards, backwards, or horizontally. The rook cannot move diagonally.
The queen can move in any direction and any number of squares. It is one of the most powerful pieces.
The king can move one space in any direction, but two kings can never be side by side.

, Set up a chess board with all of the pieces. Your child should be able to identify each piece by name. Once they have the names down, begin to focus on the movement each piece makes. If you are using the coordinates method, this is how the chess board should be set up:Each player gets 8 pawns that lie on the 2nd and 7th rows
Rooks/castles are in column A and H of rows 1 and 8.
The queen is on column D of rows 8 and 1.
The bishop is on column C and F of rows 8 and 1.
The knights are on column B and G of rows 8 and 1.
The king is in column E of rows 8 and 1.

Set up the board.,
Find a token.,
Prepare yourself to remain unbiased.,
Make the first move for each side.,
Anticipate your opponent’s moves.,
Move out the knights and bishops.,
Castle.,
Attack your opponent.,
Cede your pieces wisely.,
Capture the king.",How to Play Solo Chess," Solo chess is not a rapid game—it is a slow moving logic battle against yourself. Since the game will be played over the course of a few days or weeks, set up the board in a convenient location that others will not disturb. Place all of the pieces in their respective positions.


The back row of pieces is ordered from left to right as follows: Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook. The white queen must be placed on a white square; the black queen must be placed on a black square.
The front row of pieces contains eight pawns.;
, Over the course of your solo game, you may find it difficult to keep track of whose turn it is. A small token, such as a coin or figurine, can help you keep track. Throughout the game, move the token from side to side to signify whose turn it is.


You can also just turn the entire board around so that you look at the board from the other side.

, When you play yourself in chess, you are always aware of what your opponent—you—is thinking. It is tempting to use this advantage to skew the game towards one side or the other. Doing so, however, is not beneficial to your development as a player. In order to improve your skills through solo chess, you must remain indifferent about what side wins the game. Master chess players, while aware of their opponent’s strategy, always strive to make the best move possible., Just as in traditional chess, the player with the white pieces always opens the game. Select a white pawn to move forward one to two spaces. Switch sides and select a black pawn to move forward one to two spaces.


Try to avoid mirroring moves.
Players generally move one of the pawns in front of the king or queen. This opens up a lane for the queen and bishops., Prior to moving your pieces, always pause for a moment to think.


Ask yourself several questions about your opponent’s strategy. “What is my opponent doing?” “How did my opponent’s last move impact the game?” “Is my opponent trying to set a trap?”
After assessing the situation, formulate or adjust your strategy. First, search for moves that will threaten your opponent’s king or lead to the capture of one of their pieces. Second, determine if the move you want to make will leave your pieces vulnerable to capture. Lastly, double check your evaluation., Throughout the opening portion of the game, you want to position your pieces for future attacks. Prior to moving either queen, work to move the knights and bishops towards the center of the board. Doing so will put the knights and bishops in a position to attack your opponent’s pieces. Avoid moving too many of your pawns in an effort to capture the other player’s pawns., Castling is often the last action of your opening game. It is a move that relocates your king to a position of relative safety. In order to castle, all of the spaces between your unmoved king and an unmoved rook must be open. Slide your king two spaces towards the unmoved rook. Place the rook behind the king (between the king’s starting square and his new position).


If your opponent fails to castle, look for an opportunity to capture their king., The middlegame is devoted to strategically attacking your opponent. During this portion of the game, you must remain patient and aware of your opponent’s strategy. If your opponent fails to protect a piece, consider seizing the opportunity to capture it. Before you capture the piece:


Make sure you are not falling into a trap.
Examine how the move will impact your pieces and the safety of your king., During the middlegame, you and your opponent will inevitably capture each other’s pieces. Essentially, you will be swapping pieces with your opponent. While some swaps will be necessary and logical, others may be detrimental to the strength of your men and the safety of your king. Before swapping pieces, consider if the piece you are capturing is as valuable as the piece you are sacrificing.


The queen is the most valuable piece, followed by the rooks.
The bishops and knights are of equal value.
Pawns have the least value to you., Once the manpower of each side has diminished, the endgame begins. Manipulate your pieces so that they threaten the safety of your opponent’s king. The goal of the endgame is to checkmate your opponent before they can checkmate you. When a king can not outrun a threat to its safety and the remaining men can not thwart the threat, the king is in check.

"
"
Play a pawns only game.,
Add the bishops.,
Introduce the rooks.,
Place the knights on the board.,
Play with knights, rooks, bishops, and pawns.,
Play with the queen, king, pawn, and rook.,
Play a full game of chess.",How to Teach Children Chess2," Set up the chess board with only pawns. The goal of the game is to move as many of your pawns to the other side of the board. If two pawns meet and cannot move, they are stuck. Remind the child that the pawn can only move one space forward unless it is capturing the opponent’s pawn. If it is capturing, it can move one space diagonally.An alternate goal of the game can be to see who can move a single pawn to the other side first.
Remind the child that the white pawn moves first and that pawns can take two spaces on a first move.
This helps the child get used to playing the pawns.

, Once the child has a good grasp of pawn movement, add the bishops to the game. The goal of the game remains the same. Remind the child that the bishops can only move diagonally.This game teaches the child to:Use their pawns to protect their bishop.
Decide the best time to let their bishop out in front of their pawns.
Get their bishop behind their opponent’s pawns.
Understand the limitations that come with only being allowed to move the bishop diagonally.

, Place the rooks, bishops, and pawns on the board. The objective is still to get a pawn all the way to the other side of the board. Remind the child that the rook can move any number of squares vertically or horizontally, but it cannot jump another piece.The child should learn the importance of keeping the rook until the end of the game.
At this stage, the child should also begin to see the difference between taking their opponent’s piece and winning the actual game.

, Allow the child to move the knights on an empty board. The “L” movement is very unique and may take a little time. Pick a spot on the board that the child needs to get the knight to. Have them think through the number of moves it may take to get there.


Once the child is comfortable with the knights, add the pawns and play a game as you have done with the other pieces.

, Set up the board with all of these pieces. The goal is still to get a pawn to the other side first. This is a complex game, but your child should be ready for it because of the gradual buildup.The child should begin to learn different patterns and how the pieces work together.
If your child is having difficulty, go back to some of the more simple games. Your child should progress through each stage at their own pace.

, This game allows you to introduce the concept of check and checkmate. Check means the king is in danger. Checkmate means the king can no longer move anywhere. Only add 4 pawns for each player to the game.


Remind your child that the white piece always move first and once they take their hand off a piece, their move is over.
Focus on the movements that the king and queen pieces can make.

, If your child is comfortable with the movements of each piece, have them play a full game of chess. The goal of this game is to capture the opponent’s king. Remind your child that getting a pawn to the other side will only earn them a queen now.Again, if your child want to go back to simpler games, allow them to do so.

"
Explain pawn promotion.,
Explain en passant.,
Explain what the term ""castling"" means.",How to Teach Children Chess3," A pawn is promoted when it reaches the other side of the board. It will become a queen, rook, bishop, or rook. Once the pawn reaches the other side, you can replace it with the piece of your choosing. Pawns are most commonly promoted to queens.You can have more than one queen on the board.You may say, ""If your pawn makes it to the other side of the board, it can become a different piece. You can choose the piece that you turn it into. The queen is usually best.""

, En passant happens when a player moves the pawn two spaces on the first movement and the pawn is next to the opponent’s pawn. If this happens, the opponent can use their pawn to capture your pawn. Your opponent must capture your pawn during the next move. If the pawn is not captured during the next move, your pawn can remain..


This move may never happen naturally. Set up the board to demonstrate how this happens.A pawn can never be promoted to a king.

, Castling involves moving the king and the rook at the same time. If there is nothing between the king and the rook/castle and neither of the pieces have been moved yet, this move can happen. The king moves two spaces towards the castle and then the castle jumps to the other side of the king.The king and the rook must be in their original positions to castle.You cannot castle if the king is in check.

"
Make learning fun.,
Be encouraging.,
Allow them to make mistakes.",How to Teach Children Chess4," Talk about the pieces like they are soldiers in a war and describe the game as a battle. You can also create an entire storyline around the battle to increase excitement. If your child is into technology, there are computer games, video games,and appsthat can be used to supplement their learning.


These games are also helpful for teaching strategy and can present different scenarios.

, Give your child praise when they accomplish something. It does not matter if it is big or small. Checking a king and setting up the board correctly are both accomplishments. Also, encourage your child if they are not doing well.


You may say, “It’s ok that you did not win. You still made some really nice moves with your knights during the game.”

, Play and teach them the rules while playing. Correct them if they make illegal moves. Let them make a few moves to encourage them. Make deliberate blunders and give them an opportunity to win a few games.


Once your child has the basic moves down, learning comes from playing and experiencing different scenarios.
Emphasize that learning is a lifelong process and they can always improve their game.

Protect your king.",How to Play Chess for Beginners," Every type of piece moves differently. Here are the names of every piece and how they move (with one or two exceptions, that we'll cover in a bit):



The pawn: The most basic piece in the game (you have 8 of them). On its initial move, it can move forward one or two spaces, but it is only allowed to move forward by one space afterwards. Pawns are only allowed to attack other pieces one space diagonally from it, and cannot move backwards.

The rook: It looks like a castle tower. It can move horizontally and vertically as many spaces as are available. It can attack pieces in its path.

The knight: It's represented by a horse and is the most complicated unit. It moves in an 'L' shapes that consist of two spaces horizontally then one space vertically, or one space horizontally then two spaces vertically, in any direction. The knight is the only piece that can jump other pieces. He attacks only the pieces that are in the spaces he settles.

The bishop: It can only move diagonally, but it can move an unlimited amount of spaces until it attacks. It's shaped like a bishop's hat.

The queen: She is the most powerful piece (usually has a more feminine crown). She can move either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally by any number of spaces and attack from any of those directions.

The king: He can only move one space each turn in any direction and attacks in the same manner. He is the unit you do not want to lose at all costs, as it will make you lose the game.
Remember the strong points of the pieces.

The king is valuable and must be protected.
The queen is the most versatile piece and is the most useful for supporting pieces, and often used for forking. The queen combines the power of a bishop and a rook in one piece. She is considered to be the most valuable, next to the King.
Knights are excellent for surprise attacks and forks.Their pattern of movement is often missed and confusing to novice players.
Bishops tend to be an excellent in an open position. However many novice players often underestimate bishops and do not make full use of them.
Rooks are strong and have a long range of movement. They work best on open files.
Pawns may seem insignificant, but they can be great for trapping an opponent when sacrificed to capture a more valuable piece. If played right, a pawn can even checkmate the King!



, If your king is in check, he is under attack from your opponent's pieces. When your king is in check, you must move out of check on your very next turn. You can move out of check by three methods:

By moving your King to a safe square. A safe square is one, where your king will not be in check.
By capturing the checking piece.
By blocking with one of your pieces. This does not work for Pawns and Knights.

If you cannot do any of the above, and your king is still in check, the game is over and you have lost.









, In chess, you are trying to capture your opponent's king and they yours. While this is the primary objective, the auxiliary aim one is to protect your king from getting captured. This is done by either capturing as many of your opponent's pieces as you can or avoiding the capture of your own pieces.


Chess is a game of intelligence and strategy. There are many moves and rules that beginners will not be able to foresee or understand initially. Be patient! It gets more and more fun the more and more you play.

, Now that you know each piece you can place them on the board. Align it so each player has a light-colored square on the bottom right. Here's how to set up your pieces:


Place all the pawns on the second line in front of you so that you have a wall of pawns between you and your opponent.
Place each rook on a corner of your side of the board.
Place a knight next to each rook and a bishop next to each knight.
Place the queen in one of the two spaces that remain, according to her color (i.e. if you have a black queen, she should go on the black square; if it's white, then she should go on the white square).
Finally, place the King on the last remaining space. Check that your opponent has the same arrangement of pieces. The queens should be opposite each other and so should be the Kings.

, Each square on the board has a corresponding letter and number. When someone says something like, ""Knight to C3,"" that C3 is part of this system; it makes reference a whole lot easier. Here is how it works.

, They choose any piece they'd like to move to begin the initial attack, or the opening. They move a piece, and black counters. The opening is one of the most important parts of the game. There's no real ""right"" way to do it -- everyone has their own style and you'll find yours. But there are a few things to keep in mind:


Do not go about about attacking for now. In your opening, you're just getting your pieces to their most useful posts. You want them to be on good and safe squares.
Generally, make only 1 or 2 moves with your pawns. Then start concentrating on your more powerful pieces -- bishops, knights, queen, and rooks. ""Development"" (getting your pieces to active squares, such as the center) isn't complete until all of these pieces have moved.
A lot of your opening moves depend on your opponent -- you'll just have to feel out the game. So observe and see if you can guess what his plan is. This game is more about anticipating threats and foresight than anything else.

, If you'd like, that is. Plenty of beginners don't worry about it. But if you're curious as to how to make this game a little more French and a little more complicated than it already is, why, here's how:


If you recall, your pawn can move 2 spaces forward on its first move. Let's say you do just that, landing next to your opponent's pawn, on the same row. On the next move -- and only the next move -- your opponent can capture your pawn en passant (which literally translates to: in passing). Normally, pawns can only attack one square diagonally -- but this is an exceptional case in which it can capture in passing and still land on that same diagonal space.
Again, this can only happen directly after a pawn has made its initial 2-space move. If a turn goes by, the opportunity is lost. This move is unique only to the pawns and no other piece. Thus you cannot capture the queen or a knight by en passant

, And thus goes the game! You and your opponent take turns, trying to get to each other's king and capturing pieces in your wake. If you can threaten their queen or king and keep him on the defensive, you'll be at an advantage, but there are infinite possibilities as to how to win.


Pawns may seem like they're just in the way, but don't be tempted to sacrifice them just yet. If you get one to the other side of the board, it turns into a different piece (just not the king)! Generally people go for a queen, but you're welcome to turn it into a rook or a knight or a bishop. If you can sneak your pawn to the other side without your opponent noticing, you can change the tide of the game completely.

, If you move your knight there, what happens? Does it expose other pieces for your opponent's next play? Do you have time to play offense or does your king (or maybe even queen) need protecting? What ideas seem to be brewing on your opponent's turf? Where do you see the game going in the next few moves?


This isn't a game where you can mindlessly move pieces around -- they all affect each other in one way or another. You'll have a pawn in the way of your bishop's attack, you'll have your knight defending your king, and your opponent's rook is about to jump on your queen if you don't do something about it. So plan your next move and the one after that -- and your opponent's moves if you can, too. To win, you must be tactful and strategic!
Always have a comeback move, if possible. You can place your pawn at the will of your opponent's bishop if that means you can then take his bishop with your knight. Sometimes well-planned sacrifices must be made.

, There is a special move involving both the rook and the King. It is the only time you can move two pieces in the same turn.Apart from the pawn's en passant move, one other special move is castling. That's when your rook and your king exchange places -- it shelters the king and gets your rook developed and ready to join the action. It is generally useful to have your king castled.

You can use your castle only if :

Neither the King or the Rook to be castled have moved.
The King is not under check.
There are no pieces between the King and the rook.
When your enemy pieces do not control the squares between the final castled position and the uncastled position








In one turn, you move both your king and your rook. If castling towards the King side, your king moves two spaces right and your rook is placed right next to the king, (having moved two spaces) If castling towards the Queenside, your king moves two spaces left and your rook is placed next to the king(having moved three spaces right).

, That means you've got the king in check but this time there's no escape. When this happens, saying, ""Checkmate!"" is acceptable, but not necessary. At this point your opponent taps over his king so that it falls and signals defeat.


Stalemates do happen -- where the game basically ends in a draw. It's when you can get your king is neither in check, nor has any safe squares to move to.
There are a few other ways by which a game can end in a draw.

By agreement. If both players agree that they can no longer win or see a method to win, they can agree to draw.
By repetition. If the same exact position of the chess board, occurs at three different points in a game, the game is declared a draw. For example, if both players just keep moving their Knights back and forth to the same squares, the game will be declared a draw.
By the 50 move rule. If neither player makes a pawn move or captures a piece for 50 consecutive moves, the game will be declared as a draw. This prevents player from playing endlessly, or to tire the other player out.
By insufficient material. If neither player has sufficient material to checkmate the king, the game is considered a draw. For example, a Knight and a King alone cannot checkmate the lone enemy King.
If all other pieces except the kings are captured and are off the board. This is an example of insufficient material and a King cannot checkmate or check the other king all by himself. The game will end as a draw.



, Do not keep moving your Knight around, just because he can give lots of checks. Use your entire army! One of the biggest rookie mistakes is to only using a few of your pieces. When that happens, the rest just end up lagging behind and make for easy captures for your opponent. So keep the board lively, keep your opponent on his toes.


In your opening, place a few pawns one or two spaces forward and then start moving the other pieces. This allows more pieces on the first row to pass through and enter the playing field easily, giving you more offensive power.

, Since so many pieces can move about every which way, controlling the center is considered more beneficial than controlling the sides. When you dominate the center, your pieces have more mobility than they had at the edge or the corner. As an example, the knight only has two options to move from a corner, but he has eight options to move from a central square! Dominate the center as quickly as you can.


It's for this reason that many people have their middle pawns start off the game. Just make sure you don't open up your king for an early checkmate by a well-placed bishop or a queen!

, This is pretty obvious, yet many players hang their pieces, even grandmasters as well! If you must give them away, have them be in a trade. Never just relinquish one mindlessly -- they're all valuable, whether it is a pawn or a queen. There is a point system, if you're curious. The more valuable they are, the more points they're worth:Pawns are worth 1 point
Knights are worth 3 points
Bishops are worth 3 points
Rooks are worth 5 points
Queens are worth 9 points

Kings are invaluable because if you lose your king, you lose the game.



, This is something you should pay special attention to. If you do nothing else -- if you aren't one much for doing the attacking -- you have to protect your king. Get him in the corner by castling, set up a fortress of pieces around him, make sure to give him a square to run, in case your opponent does manage to give you a check. You want to get your opponent fleeing rather than attacking as soon as possible.


He can do very little on his own, yet he can hold his own. In the starting and the middle phases of the game, he almost always needs at least one or two pieces to watch out for any checks. However in the end stages of the game, when only a couple of pieces and few pawns are left on the board, the King then becomes a fighting piece and should be centralized.

Use castling for rooks and Kings that have not moved from their original position.",How to Play Chess," The orientation of the board is important for proper play. When positioned properly, each player will have a black square in the lower left corner.;
, This piece is also known as the castle. It is abbreviated as ""R"" in notation and starts on a1, h1, a8, h8. Those are the corners in the rank and file system.



How do they move? Rooks may move any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally. If an opponent's piece blocks the path, that piece may be captured by moving the rook into the occupied square.
Pieces cannot be jumped (except when castling). If your piece is on your rook's path, your rook must stop before it.

Castling is a special move, detailed below.

, This is the horse piece. In notation, it's referred to as ""N"" (""Kt"" for older texts). Technically speaking, it starts on b1, g1, b8, g8.



How do they move? Knights are the only pieces that can jump over other pieces. They move in an ""L"" shaped pattern. That is, two squares horizontally or vertically and then one square perpendicular to that. For example, a knight may move two spaces horizontally and one space vertically, and vice versa.
The knight cannot be blocked, and only captures pieces that it lands on. In other words, you can ""jump"" over all the pieces blocking the knight, and capture a piece as you land.

, In notation, they're referred to as ""B."" They start on c1, f1, c8, f8.



How do they move? Bishops may move any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction. Like rooks, they may capture an opponent's piece within its path.
The bishop can only proceed, land, and capture diagonally on the same color squares as it starts on before the game.
Just like rooks, if your piece is in their path, they must stop before it. If it's your opponent's piece, you may land on that spot, making a capture.

, The positions for black and white are mirrored. If you're white, your Queen will be on your 4th square from the left. If you're black, she'll be on the 5th spot from your left. This is, technically, d1, d8. d1 is a white square (for the white Queen); d8 is a black square (for the black Queen).



How do they move? Queens can be thought of as the rook and bishop combined -- the most powerful piece on the board. Queens can move any number of vacant squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
Attacking with a Queen is the same as with rooks and bishops. That is, you take an opponent's piece that lies within its path by moving to that piece's spot.

, This piece is notated as ""K"" and starts on e1, e8.



How do they move? Kings can move exactly one space in any direction and can attack any piece except the opponent's King and Queen (it cannot go near it or else it would result in check).
Kings are not offensive pieces. This is the piece you want to protect with the others.

, Pawns are denoted by the absence of a letter and take up the eight spots in front, forming a shield to your larger pieces.



How do they move? Well, they normally only move forward one space. However, the first time it is moved, it may move forward one or two spaces.
If another piece is in front of it, the pawn may not move or capture that piece.
Pawns may only attack a target if the target is one space diagonally forward from the pawn (i.e. up one square and one square to the right or left).
There is a special move that is sometimes encountered, called en passant (in passing). (See below).

Pawn promotion, detailed below, occurs when your pawn has marched all the way across the board to the 8th (or 1st) rank.

, This is not necessary, but makes it easier to visualize moves and talk about moves, especially in chess literature and on websites. Also, when your opponent wasn't paying attention and says, ""Where did you go?"", you can respond with ""Rook to a4 (Ra4)."" Here's how it works:


The files are the columns; they go up and down. From left to right, they are a-h. They are based on white's side.
The ranks are the rows; they are horizontal. From bottom to top, they are 1-8. All of white's main pieces start at the 1 position (1st rank); black's main pieces start at the 8 position (8th rank).
It is an excellent learning habit to notate your game, writing down the square you and your opponent moved to on a sheet of paper. You can only do so if you know your files and ranks.

, To win, you need to checkmate your opponent's King. This means to get his King in a position where he will be captured no matter what -- he cannot move and no other piece can protect him. Checkmate — that is, the end of the game — can happen in three moves or it can happen in 300. Most longer games are different.


The secondary goal is to get rid of all your opponent's pieces (thus making checkmate easier). You capture pieces by landing on the square they occupy.
This is all going on while you're protecting your own King, obviously.

, This is like checkmate-lite. That means the on next move you could've captured him, but he can still flee or another piece can move to defend him. The game isn't won, but it certainly looks like it's in your favor.


When this happens, be sure to verbally say ""Check."" Your opponent must then do one of the following:


Avoid the check by moving their King to any vacant square not attacked by another piece.

Block the check by placing any piece between your piece and their king.

Capture your piece that is putting the king in check with any of their pieces (including the king himself).



, In other words, you cannot make a move that exposes your King to capture on the next turn. This means you cannot move your King into an area an opponent's piece can move to the next turn. You also cannot unblock your King from attack, that is, move a piece that would expose your King to direct attack.

, Use the positions described in the first section on a 64-square, 8x8 board. If you don't have one, guess what? With wikiHow, you can make your own.

, The player with white pieces begins the game by moving one piece as described above. Turn then passes to black. Regardless of the moves, players always take turns. There is no doubling up or skipping.


If this is your first game, choose who gets white by a flip of a coin or, if both players are good sports, whoever is the weaker player. Generally speaking, white has a slight advantage.If it's not your first game, the player who lost the previous game should play white.

, The captured piece is then removed from the board and does not return for the remainder of the game.


If we're getting serious, a player has to move a piece once he's touched it. If he only wants to adjust it, he must announce ""adjust"" before he places his hand on the piece., Making a move is compulsory; it is not legal to ""pass"", even when having to move is detrimental. Play continues until a King is checkmated or a draw occurs. Draws can occur in five scenarios:Stalemate (The king is not in check but cannot move anywhere, and there are no other pieces left)
Insufficient material (The pieces on the board cannot checkmate at all, so no side will win nor lose)
Threefold repetition (A position has been repeated three times, such as players moving pieces back and forth)
Fifty-move rule (Fifty moves have occurred since the last piece capture or pawn move)
Agreement (Players reach a consensus and agree to a draw)

, Apart from a stalemate, checkmate must happen to end the game -- where either your King or your opponent's King cannot be rescued. Whoever accomplishes checkmate should say ""Checkmate!"" to ensure both players are aware the game is over. Let's explore the concept of ""check"" and ""checkmate"" a bit more:


Do one of the following to get out of check (your King is only threatened):

Take the piece threatening your king. You can do this with another piece or take it with your King directly (if the piece is not protected).
Move your King out of the range of the attacking piece.
Block the piece threatening your king with another piece.


If you cannot get your King out of check, this is a checkmate and the game ends with your opponent winning. If their King is in checkmate, you've won.

, It is quickest to pair like pieces (bishop for bishop) and so forth. Then, the left over pieces will show who has the current disadvantage and by how much.

, Generally, pieces are the strongest in the center of the board where they command the most real estate.



Pawns are strongest together, such as in chains (diagonal lines of pawns). Try not to break this formation unless there is a clear, overriding advantage to be had by doing so.

Knights are weakest near the edge of the board.

The maximum number of spaces a knight can control is eight. If the knight is next to the edge of the board, the number of spaces is cut in half to four. Likewise, if the knight is positioned in the row or column one away from the board edge, the knight's power is reduced to 75% of maximum - it controls six spaces.
You may not miss the power of the knight right away but if you move a knight near the edge of the board, you will often find yourself wasting a move to re-position the knight closer to the action which is usually near the center of the board.



Bishops are strongest on the long diagonals (major diagonals) where they command the most space. It is really not necessary that the bishops be positioned right in the middle of the board where they are absolutely the strongest in terms of the number of spaces controlled.

Realize that the bishop's power can be throttled by the opponent placing a protected piece along a diagonal controlled by your bishop. On the other hand, that piece is pinned in that position if the piece it is protecting is of high value.



Rooks are most powerful on open files. Position rooks on columns that contain none of your pawns. Rooks are also most powerful when controlling the 7th rank for white (2nd rank for black), but only if the opposing King is on its starting rank.

Queens have the most power when commanding the center of the board. On the other hand, they are in the most danger there as well. It is often good strategy to keep the queen one move away from this position and to not shield or block the queen's might excessively with your own pieces.

Kings should always be protected. They are best shielded by lower value pieces.

, As deduced from the optimal piece positionings detailed above, pieces near the center of the board are at their most powerful. Usually, the game is a fight for control of the center and, when you're in the center, your opponent has far fewer ""good"" places to choose from. You have power that can expand in either direction -- he'll be relegated to the side, constantly putting him on the defensive.


Pawns can help with this. While your more powerful pieces are attacking, a pawn or two can maintain control in the center. See? They are useful.

, This will likely determine the rest of the game. A weak opening automatically puts you at a disadvantage for the rest of the game. Here are a few things to keep in mind:


Usually, you'll be best off opening with the d or e pawn (4th or 5th). That opens up the center of the board.
Make only a couple of pawn moves at the start. You want to get your more powerful pieces out as soon as possible.
Get your knights out and then your bishops. Knights range is limited. It often takes several hops to get them into the fray. (Bishops, rooks, and queens can swoop the entire length of the board, whereas the lowly pawn must trudge space by space.) Sometimes, it is less obvious what effect moving a knight might have, so their attack is often stealthiest.

, If your rook is sitting back there in the corner, you are wasting powerful ammo. The beauty of chess is that no one piece can win the game -- you need a team of pieces to bombard your opponent's King. So capture each piece- including your opponent's king!


This is especially important if you're playing a skilled player. It's pretty easy to thwart one piece; it's possible to thwart two, but it's incredibly hard to get out of a three-spot.

, Yes, it's important to capture pieces. Yes, it's important to checkmate your opponent's King. But at the end of the day, if your King is unprotected, you'll get checkmated, the game will be over, and that offense you were running will be entirely useless. So while you're strategizing in the front, remember what's going on in the back!


Chess is so fun because you have to think about half a dozen things at once. You have to protect your King while your other pieces are planning two moves in advance. You have to predict where your opponent is going to all the while reading what they're doing now and not letting your own get captured. Once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to do all of these things at once without batting an eye.

, If your opponent made a move, there's a reason why. He's setting something up. He's eying a potential attack. What is he doing? What is he aiming for? Try your best to read this so you can circumnavigate his actions and thwart his plan.


Same goes for you, you know. Maybe you can't capture a pawn on this move, but what move can you make now to set yourself up in your next move, or maybe the move after that? This isn't your normal board game -- every move you make now affects the moves you make in the future.

, When your opponent makes a move and doesn't take one of your pieces, take a second to scan the board. Is he in a position to take one of your pieces? If so, don't allow it! Move that piece out of the way or to threaten another piece of your opponent's. Or, what's better, capture that threatening piece yourself! Never just let a piece go.


Unless it's all part of strategy, of course. If you're using a piece as bait to draw your opponent to a specific area of the board, totally let that piece go. As long as you're planning something more devious yourself!

, Did you know you can checkmate your opponent in as little as two moves? There's very specific instructions for a win in two, three, and four moves and, of course, all will leave your opponent scratching his or her head. If you're curious, here's a few wikiHow articles to read up on:

, En passant (from French: ""in passing"") is a special capture made by a pawn. It happens immediately after a player moves a pawn two squares forward from its starting position, and an opposing pawn could have captured it if it had only moved one square forward. In this situation, the opposing pawn may, on the immediately subsequent move, capture the pawn as if taking it ""as it passes"" through the first square.


The resulting position would then be the same as if the pawn had only moved one square forward and the opposing pawn had captured normally. En passant must be done on the very next turn, or the right to do so is lost. - It is ""now or never.""


, If a pawn reaches the 8th rank (or 1st rank if you are black), or the other side of the board, it can be promoted to a knight, bishop, rook, or Queen. It cannot stay as a pawn or be promoted to another King. Quite obviously, this is very, very good if you can manage it.


To indicate pawn promotion in chess notation, write the square that it moves to (e.g., c8). Then you put an equals sign (e.g., c8=). Then put the abbreviation for the piece that you want it to promote it to (e.g., c8=R).


, This is used to get your King out of the center, where it is most vulnerable. To castle, you move your King two squares to the left or right, then your rook jumps from the corner square over the King to the next square. You cannot castle if:


There are pieces between the King and rook.
The King is in check, or it will have to go through check or into check to castle.
The King or rook has already moved in the game.
The rook is not on the same rank as the King (prevents castling with a promoted pawn).

Understand repetition and counterpoint and exploit it in your solutions.",How to Solve a Cryptogram," Most cryptograms or cryptoquotes are basic substitution ciphers, meaning that the letters of the alphabet are being represented by other letters. In some ciphers, different sorts of symbols may be used. The rules should be described somewhere on the particular cipher you're attempting to solve. A cryptogram in Klingon wouldn't be any more difficult than a cryptogram in Cyrillic, because the symbols act as patterns in the end. Find the patterns and you'll crack the code.


In general, the better you can divorce yourself from the letters themselves and look for the patterns underneath the letters, the closer you'll be to solving the puzzle. Try to disassociate yourself as much as possible from the letters you're looking at.
Cryptograms don't try to play tricks on you, however difficult they may be. In almost all cryptograms, letters will never stand for themselves. In other words, the ""X"" in the puzzle you're trying to work out definitely doesn't stand for ""X"" in the alphabet.;
, It's unlikely that you'll recognize one mess of jumbled up nonsense letters as a particular word right away, no matter how long you look at it. try to figure out the most likely single letter words, then carry that substitution through the rest of the puzzle, filling in as many blanks as possible with educated guesses, then filling in the remaining blank spaces.


Completing a cryptogram is a slow process that'll require lots of guessing. You'll weigh lots of possibilities and make the best guess at the time. If, later, that guess turns out to be wrong, then change it.

, When you've got a bunch of blanks in the words, you'll eventually have to start plugging and chugging. You might exhaust all the short words and the obvious single-letters relatively quickly, meaning you'll have next-to-nothing to work with. Learning to recognize common patterns can help you to make the most high-probability bets, so you can learn to play the odds and increase your chances of making the right guess.

, Even if you're a code-crackin' pro, the name of the game is guess-and-check, making it almost a sure thing that you'll have to change things up at some point. The best way to work a cryptogram is to do it on paper, in front of you, with a pencil.


It's a good idea to also keep handy a dictionary, to look up the proper spelling of words, and some scrap paper on which to scratch out possibilities. Write out all the letters in order of their most common use in the language on your piece of paper, so if it comes to blind guessing, you can use the most common guesses first.
The English alphabet organized in frequency of use, reads like this: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, C, W, M, F, Y, G, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z. As you discover the value of each letter, write it above corresponding letter on your scratch key.

, Working on a wrong assumption can be a good thing. If you've been cruising along on a puzzle, then find out you've been working with the wrong substitute for ""G"" for the last hour, celebrate! You know one more letter that you can eliminate as a possibility, meaning that you're one letter closer to having the cryptogram cracked. Any time you find yourself in a position in which you're sure about something, it's a good moment for a code-cracker.

, No, it's not a shadowy puzzle organization with decoder rings and secret handshakes. The letters e, t, a, o, i and n appear more commonly than any other letters in the English language, making this an extremely useful collection to learn to recognize. If you learn to quickly and efficiently recognize the patterns in which they appear, you'll be a pro cracker in no time.


Do a quick count of the most commonly-recurring letters in your cryptogram and circle them. There's a much-higher probability that that letter will be one of these. Learning to combine frequency of appearance with pattern recognition will reveal the substitutions.

, Because cryptograms often use quotes from people, the word ""I"" is almost as common as the word ""a,"" so be careful before making assumptions about words you see appearing alone. The trick to figuring out if it's ""I"" or ""a"" is to experiment with the letters in other words and look for common patterns.


If there is a three-letter word beginning with that same letter, the letter is almost certainly the word ""a."" There are a number of common three-letter words beginning with ""a"" and very few which start with ""i.""
If a possible three-letter word doesn't give you a good indication, try ""A"" first, since it's the third-most-common letter in the language. Substitute it through the rest of the puzzle and start working it. If it turns out to be wrong, you'll at least know it's got to be ""I"".

, Another secret-weapon in helping to get your first couple of letters cracked is the existence of the apostrophe. Signifying either a contraction (can't) or a possessive (hers), apostrophes give you an excellent indication of what's behind the apostrophe, or at least help you narrow down the possibilities.


An apostrophe with one letter behind it has to be either t, s, d, or m.
Apostrophes with two letters behind, have to be either ""re,"" ""ve,"" or ""ll.""
To distinguish between possessives and contractions, look at the letter before the apostrophe. If it's always the same, you almost definitely have the ""n't"" combination. If not, then you're more likely dealing with the possessive., Using what you know about the frequency of letters appearing and what you've gathered from context clues about individual-word letters and apostrophes, you can get cracking more by starting in on the short two-letter words.


The most common two-letter words are: of, to, in, it, is, be, as, at, so, we, he, by.
If you find two two-letter words where the letters are reversed, you've got either ""no"" and ""on."" You just have to figure out which is which!

, The word ""the"" is extremely common and can be measured against ""that"" for a good indication of letters. For instance, if a sentence contains both ""BGJB"" and ""BGD,"" you can be pretty confident that you're on the right track, and B = T. In the same cryptogram, ""BGDL"" would most likely be ""then"" and ""BGDZD"" would be ""there.""


The most common three-word letters in English are: the, and, for, are, but, not, you, all, any, can, her, was, one, our, out, day, get, has, him, his, how, man., Words longer than 5 or 6 letters will most of the time include some kind of common prefix or suffix, of which you can learn to look for, to make discovering the substitutions much easier.Common prefixes include: anti-, de-, dis-, en-, em-, in-, im-, pre-, il-, ir-, mid-, mis-, non-.
Common suffixes include: -able, -ible, -al, -ment, -ness, -ous, -ious, -ly.

, Digraphs are two-letter combos in English that result in one sound, and most often one of the letters is an ""h"". These are especially useful if you find an ""h"" in the last position of a word, because you know only so many letters can combine with it in the correct way. It's likely either a c, p, s, or t.


Other common digraphs include: ck, sk, lk, ke, qu, ex.
Related two-letter combination lucky breaks include double-letters. These won't show up too often in cryptograms, but they're extremely helpful when you find them. ""LL"" is the most common double-letter combo, shortly followed by ""ee"".

, Vowels are present in every word in English and represent almost 40% of the words in a given text. They'll almost never come three-in-a-row, or four. To narrow down the vowels and start filling in more blanks, you can learn a few vowel tips.


The most common vowel is ""e""; the least common is ""u"".
Unless the text is about skiing or vacuuming, a doubled vowel is probably ""e"" or ""o"".
A pattern of repeating letters in a long word usually indicates vowels, like the ""i"" repeating in the word ""civilization."" However, if adjacent letters repeat, they're more likely to consonants.

, If your cryptogram includes any punctuation, pay particularly close attention to the words on either side of it. Commas, periods, and other punctuation can clue you into several possibilities and help you start narrowing it down from there to make more educated guesses.


Conjunctions like ""but"" or ""and"" will often follow commas.
A question mark often implies a ""wh"" somewhere in the clause preceding it. Start looking for possibilities, if you've got a question mark at the end of the cryptogram sentence.

, Like crossword, word search, and other puzzle-makers, cryptogram writers have a particular sense of humor, and know the rules and the difficulties of solving the puzzles inside and out. Look for the following relatively common words that appear in cryptograms with identifiable patterns.


That (or high, says, else, dead, died)
There/Where/These (in any case you've identified ""h"" and ""e"")
People
Always
Everywhere
Somewhere
William or Kennedy (if a name, otherwise look for ""million"" or ""letters"")
Never (or state, fewer, color, level)

, Most puzzle cryptograms are relatively obscure quotations, usually aphoristic statements about ""people"" or ""society,"" meaning cryptograms are small compact little philosophies. Because you know this for sure, you can sometimes start narrowing the focus in terms of the content of the cryptogram to make more educated guesses about the words. Big concepts and abstracts are the order of the day for most cryptogram puzzles.


Comparative and superlative words like ""always"" and ""everywhere"" will often appear in cryptograms because of the nature of the content. Other common words in this category include more, less, nobody, usually, better, worse, everything, often, and rarely.

, Cryptoquotes usually will usually end with the name of the author of the quote. Authors are usually identified as ""first name last name"", but some exceptions can be exploited.""Anonymous,"" for example, wrote a lot of great quotes.


A two-letter word at the beginning of the author's name is probably Dr.
A two-letter word at the end of the author's name is probably a suffix like ""Jr"" or ""Sr"" or a Roman numeral as in ""Pope Paul VI""
A short word in the middle of a name might be a common nobiliary particle like ""de"" or ""von.""

, You probably don't need to diagram out the sentence in your cryptogram, but if you can anticipate the placement or definite and indefinite articles, linking verbs, and other common constructions, you'll be a lot closer to the answer.


Look for nouns after personal pronouns like ""his"" or ""hers.""
Recognize helping verbs, like am, be, been, or have, which precede another verb, in a sentence like, ""I am helping you learn to solve cryptograms."" They are usually never more than 5 letters.

, Many sentences will work in some kind of parallel structure, recalling a different form or iteration of the same word somewhere later in the line. Since cryptograms are often taken from quotes and speeches, this is especially common in those rhetorical devices.


Many aphorisms will include binaries to compare and make a rhetorical point. If the word ""truth"" appears, you might also look for ""lie"" somewhere later in the sentence.
Look for alternate forms of the same word. ""Pleasure"" and ""pleasurable"" might both show up in a cryptogram. Don't bang your head against the wall trying to figure out what other word it could be that looks almost exactly the same.

The only differences are the number of illegal moves allowed, and the timing formats.One illegal move can mean a loss in a game of blitz chess.

, Anyone that knows how to play the game will do. Consider your level of playing when choosing an opponent. Don’t start off with someone that is much more advanced than you when you are a beginner., Players sometimes lose because of finger fatigue. Stretching your fingers will help circulation as you play.Make a gentle fist. Hold for thirty seconds. Then, release and spread your fingers wide. Repeat four times.Place your palm flat on a table. Straighten your fingers as flat as you can against the surface of the table. Hold for thirty seconds. Release and repeat four times.

, The person playing White gets the privilege of moving first, but the person playing Black chooses which side of the table to sit on.

, This includes how the pieces are set up, the time on the clocks, and the clock's orientation. Once play begins, none of these can be changed.


The time on the clocks should be set to the amount of time you want to play the game. In a blitz game, you should set the clock between one to ten minutes.
The clock should be placed on either side of the chess board. Black decides which side of the board to place the clock., Wait for your opponent to move if you're playing Black.


After every move, you must hit the plunger on your side of the chess clock with the same hand you used to move the chess piece. This pauses your clock and starts your opponent's. If you forget to hit the clock, your opponent moves, and you catch it before they correct the mistake, it is considered an illegal move and your opponent loses the match.
Remember that the point of Blitz chess is playing a fun, fast chess game. If you take too long to agonize over your moves, you'll lose. You should only take a few seconds at most to make a move.

, Ways of winning include:


Mating (checkmating) the king, by threatening to capture him on the next move in such a way that he cannot escape.
Your opponent can resign if there is no way to win.
The small plastic flag on your opponent's clock falls before yours, indicating that he has run out of time. According to some rule sets, he can keep playing until you notice the flag fall and comment on it.
You notice that your opponent made an illegal move before your next move.
The chess game can also be declared a draw by mutual agreement, if there's no way for either to win, if the kings are stalemated, or if your opponent runs out of time or makes an illegal move, yet you don't have sufficient resources on the board to checkmate his king.

, A game of blitz chess is not that different from any other game of chess. Blitz chess is just played much faster. The fast-paced game of blitz chess may be too overwhelming for someone who is new to the game of chess. A good way to get better at blitz chess is to improve your game of standard chess., Blitz chess can often seem harder than standard chess because the short time of the game makes the player emotional and excited. Try playing a slightly longer game. Playing a longer game will help you train to think clearly and rationally while playing., The best way to improve at blitz chess is to play with more advances players that challenge you to better your game. It may get tiring to play with much more advanced players too often, so practice with other players of mixed levels of strength.Try playing with a player that you beat 1 out of 4 to 1 of 8 games against.
Occasionally play with weaker players. This will build your confidence, and help the weaker players improve their games.

, Chess is thought to be 80% tactics, and it is not any different for blitz chess. Pay attention to your and your opponent’s positions while playing. Spotting your opponent’s tactics and tactical mistakes will give an advantage in the game."

Know the goal of the game to keep track of the rules.,
Create a grid of dots at least four dots wide and four dots long.,
Give each player a pencil or pen.,
Flip a coin, play rock-paper-scissors, or otherwise decide who gets to go first.,
Each turn, draw one horizontal or vertical line to connect two dots.,
Draw the 4th wall of a box to win it for yourself.,
Take an extra turn if you complete a box.,
Count up each player's number of boxes once the whole board is covered.,
Play the game using free internet programs, alternatively.",How to Play Dots and Boxes1," Dots and boxes is a simple game with a simple goal: whoever ""owns"" the most boxes at the end of the game wins. You and your opponent take turns drawing horizontal or vertical lines to connect the boxes. When someone draws a line that completes a box, you write your initial inside to win the box. Once all the dots have been connected, you can count up the boxes and find the winner., Using a pen and pencil, make a simple vertical line of dots, each about 1 cm apart. Make three more columns of dots going horizontally, so you have an even square of at least 16 dots.


You can make any size board you want -- from 6x6 to 10x10. Even uneven boards, like a 4x6, will work out fine.
While shorter games can be played on 3x3 grids, they must generally be at least 4x4 provide a worthwhile game., It is often fun to play with different color inks, allowing you to look back on the game and see who played or set up what boxes, but it is not essential. In a pinch, you can share a pencil as well.

, This may seem like a small choice, but for higher-level strategies (which do exist in Dots) there is a slight difference in play for who goes first. The best practice is to play multiple games, switching who is first each time.


Note that this difference is slight, especially if you don't care about the precise mathematical strategies. There is no real advantage to going either first or second., Early on this will be mostly random, as there are not enough lines to win any boxes. Each line simply goes from one dot to it's neighboring dot either above, below, left, or right. There are no diagonal lines.

, Each box is worth one point, so write your initial in the completed box to score it for yourself. If you have two different colored pens, you can also scribble your color in to mark it as well.


For strategy purposes, most computer programs use two colors for the teams, usually red and blue. The rest of the article will use Red and Blue as the hypothetical players.

, Once you've finished a box, drawing the 4th line, you get to keep going. This allows you to create chains, where the 4th wall of your first box makes the 3rd wall of another box. You can then use your extra turn to complete this box too, keeping the cycle alive until the chain runs out.


A ""chain"" is a line of boxes that one player can take in one turn, and is the central strategy element in boxes. Whoever gets the longest and/or most chains usually wins.
You must take your extra turn -- you cannot skip it., The player with the largest number of boxes win. If you want to continue playing, you should draw a new grid, switch who goes first and keep going.

, Sites like these will draw the boards for you, often letting you choose the size of the grid as well. All of the rules are written into the code, meaning you can just focus on playing.

Avoid creating the third side of a box until you absolutely have to.,
Keep track of the length of a ""run,"" trying to give away the shortest chains possible.,
Let your opponent win the last two boxes in any chain longer than three squares.,
Force good opponents into giving you the first chain.,
Think about cordoning off sections of the board when trying to force the right number of chains.,
Sacrifice a chain to reset the count if you're pre-determined to lose.",How to Play Dots and Boxes2," Once a box has three sides, the next player up can complete the box to score a point. Early in the game, there is never a reason to draw in this third line, as you are simply offering up a point to your opponent.

, Eventually, you're going to have to give up boxes, and it is very rare that you'll only give up one at a time. When contemplating what box to give away, count out the number of boxes a chain reaction would be worth. Is there another run that could give away that has fewer points?

, This may seem sacrilegious, as you're giving away free boxes, but what it actually does is force the other player to take the two boxes and then give you the next available chain. Note that this strategy only works if there are no open moves left -- otherwise they could take the two boxes and still avoid giving you a chain. When played well, this strategy will win you most games.


In serious games, this is called a ""double-cross."" Double-crosses are the heart of serious dots strategy.
Once you make a double-cross, you gain control of the board. Your opponents only moves are to open up a new chain for you or take the two boxes you've given them., If both players know the double-cross rule mentioned above, then it would seem like every game will come down to who wins the first chain, as they can then double-cross their opponent until they win. This is true -- the winner of the first chain is usually the winner. But there is a way to manipulate the game to ensure you win the very first chain, double-cross the rest of the time, and thus win the game. How? You control the number of chains available on the board based on a simple mathematical rule:


If there have an odd number of total dots (5x5 board, 9x9, etc.) then the first player wins if there is an odd number of chains. The second player wins if there are an even number.
If there are an even number of dots (4x4 board, 6x6, etc.) then the first player wins if there is an even number of chains. The second player wins if there are an odd number of chains.Note: A set of just two boxes is not considered a chain in this strategy.

, While the rule above is helpful in theory, you actually have to know how to set-up the right number of chains to make it work. To do this, consider that most chains take up large, continuous areas of the board -- sections, not randomly snaking lines. Instead of making specific chains, make specific areas. For a 5x5 example board, remember that the first player (for this example, Red) wants an odd number of chains:


Red should try to split the board into three parts by creating a ""hallway"" of boxes down the center of the board, either horizontally or vertically. This then creates a middle chain and two chains on either side -- three total -- for a Red win.
Blue should try to cut the board in half, with 1 chain on each side. This allows an even number of chains -- two -- and a Blue win., Continuing with the 5x5 example where Red goes first (and wants an odd number of chains), imagine there are three chains on the board, meaning Blue will lose. However, if Blue has at least 1 more box then Red, she can still tie the game, and she can win if they're up 3 boxes or more. To do so, you give up a chain before you're forced to, but you do so in a way that cuts the chain into two separate chains -- giving blue an even number of chains remaining and a new chance to win. You give up the first chain, yes -- but you also minimize the long-term damage.


Remember this only works if there is another option available that doesn't give up a chain -- a two-sided box you can safely draw a line in after cutting the chain up.
If you must respond to this scenario as Red, you have two options -- take the chain or leave the boxes for Blue later. If the game is early on, sacrifice the boxes. If you're near the end and it's close, take them and keep moving."

Take an imaginary walk.,

Repeat these 50 items in your head.,
Add the final two pieces of furniture.,
Convert 52 cards into 52 celebrities.,
Remember each suit.,
Remember each card.,
Create a 52 card matrix.,
Practice using your matrix.,
Go through a deck of cards.,
Use a second deck of cards and reassemble the order of the first.,
Keep training.",How to Memorize a Deck of Cards," You will need to take a walk through a place that you are very familiar with such as your home. As you walk through your home you will need to be familiar with 52 spots within your home to store in your mental journal. Choose 5 rooms in your home.For example, choose your bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen, and office.;
, Picture yourself at the doorway as you look around the room and spot 10 large pieces of furniture. Picture them as you look clockwise. The items must be large and avoid choosing the same item for different rooms. For example, don’t choose a tv in the bedroom if you’ve chosen it for the living room.Choosing items for your bedroom can be similar to, starting at your left, #1 computer, #2 bed, #3 dresser, #4 mirror, #5 tv, etc. Choose large items like your desk instead of the pencil on your desk.

, Drill these items until you can repeat them with your eyes closed in rapid succession. You don’t want to stumble or be confused so if something persistently gives you trouble, think about finding an easier item to remember. You may use flashcards or physically walk around the room over and over, whatever helps lock the 50 items into your memory., You will need two extra pieces of furniture because a deck of cards has 52 cards to remember. You may choose two pieces of furniture in another room or two landmarks in your backyard or garage., Your mind will tend to remember the unusual and things that stand out. Celebrities are great to remember for the roles or infamy. You will systematically form a celebrity matrix to make memorization easier., Each suit will be associated with a personality type. Memorize the suits (personalities):Spades: absurd or amusing people
Diamonds: rich and wealthy people
Clubs: crazy or tough people
Hearts: people you love or are fan of

, Each card will be associated with a category. Females will always be even numbers and males will always be odd. Females and males will always be paired up. For example, 10s are powerful women so 9s are powerful men. Memorize the categories:Celebrity couples are royalty so they are the Kings and Queens.

King = male half of a celebrity couple
Queen = female half of celebrity couple.


Jacks were clergymen and therefore bachelors.

Jacks = famous male bachelors


The number 10 and 9 are the highest numbers in the deck so they are the most powerful men and women

10 = Famous powerful women
9 = Famous power men


The number 8 looks like an hourglass so 8 and 9 are associated with hunks and bikini models.

8 = Women known for their physique
7 = Men known for the physique


5 and 6 sound like eff and sex so think about this pair as controversial.

6 = Women known for controversy
5 = Men known for controversy


Think of celebrities or their characters who have been in movie trilogies for 4 and 3.

4 = Females who have been in movie trilogies
3 = Males who have been in movie trilogies


1 is better known as Ace, which is a sports term used in tennis. Think of 2 and 1 as famous athletes.

2 = Female athletes
1 = Male athletes



, You may use your computer or a pen and paper to create your grid to help you memorize the matrix. You have 13 categories and four personalities to memorize.For example, the ace (a male athlete) of diamonds (rich) could be Michael Jordan.

, Go through a shuffled deck and look at your matrix as each card is shown. Translate each card to the image you have created. Try to recall a card before looking at the matrix.Practice over and over until you can look at every card without needing to refer back to your matrix., Shuffle a deck of cards and use a timer to go through the deck as quickly as you can. Go through the mental map of your room and assign each character to the position at which they are drawn. Try to associate as much action and emotion into the mental map as you can with each character. The more bizarre you can make the image, the better chance you have at memorizing it.For example, if the first room of your mental map is your bedroom, the first location is your desk, and the first card drawn is the ace (a male athlete) of diamonds (rich), which you’ve assigned as Michael Jordan, you can picture Michael Jordan dunking on your desk., Go through your mental map that you have created. Walk through your house and picture each celebrity in each room doing something different at each of the ten pieces of furniture. Remember what each suit and number means and remember to go through each room clockwise., Practice to sharpen your memory and improve your speed. Physically walk around your rooms to help better visualize each card and their associated celebrity. You won’t be able to memorize a deck without first remembering your mental map and celebrity matrix.Push yourself to go faster by using a timer and challenging yourself to break your own record."

If you are planning on doing this, ensure you have enough adults with you to supervise.;
, Torrential downpours are no excuse if you’ve planned ahead and asked the parents of the party goers to bring a change of clothes for afterwards.

, Outdoor party games are enjoyed by children, but they are also ideal for the adults. They do not only give the children an opportunity to expend some of their couped-up energy, they let the children exercise and allow you to concentrate on things inside the house (e.g. setting the party table, arranging the food or getting the cake ready).

, Naturally, “Hide and Seek” has more scope in an outdoor area; nevertheless if you are in a public place, you should tell the partygoers where the boundaries of the play area are.

, A fun addition to any outdoor party are bouncy trampolines.

, This is a children's favorite outdoor party game. You can play this the usual way (splitting the group into teams and letting them throw balls made of sponge at each other) or by making one person the thrower (and whoever the thrower hits with a ball replaces them as the thrower). You can adapt this so that if someone is made a thrower more than twice, they become a permanent thrower. Ensure you have a sufficient number of balls made of sponge (about the size of a soccer ball); five should be enough.

, Typically have an adult playing the part of Mr. Jelly (who can only run after the children with wibbly-wobbly limbs!).

, Setting this up in your backyard is quite straightforward; if you choose to do so in a park or other public place, you may discover (as I have done before!) that some of the treats have been taken by strangers!

, These are also great fun. You could play ""Tag"" or ""Dodge Ball"" with water balloons (better in the summer); or you could hold a race to see who can burst the greatest number of balloons.

, “Mermaid Child” is where the children have to swim like mermaids and “Dry Hand” is where everyone swims but tries to keep one of their hands dry. Obviously, these pool games depend on the swimming abilities of the group.

, These are a favorite with girls. ""Hula Marathon"" is where the winner is the person who can keep the hula hoop spinning on their hips the longest and “Hula’s Got Ya” which is basically tag but using the hula hoop to 'hula' people; your children will almost certainly have their own entertaining ideas too.

Learn how each ""weapon"" in the game triumphs over another weapon.",How to Play Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock," This is the basis of the game.;
, The hand symbols are as follows:


Rock - form a fist.






Scissors - hold the hand out, with the pointer and middle finger separated; all other fingers must be in.






Paper - hold the hand out, extending all fingers.






Lizard - have the fingers out and cupped, thumb below them, to look like a sock-puppet mouth.






Spock - perform Spock's traditional Vulcan salute!

Spock smashes scissors






Scissors decapitate lizard






Lizard eats paper






Paper disproves Spock






Spock vaporizes rock






And as it's always been, Rock crushes scissors

Prepare the cards.,

Fill in the bingo boxes.,

Distribute the cards and pens or pencils to each person as they arrive to the party.
,

Announce the game rules to everyone.,

Declare the winner with a full or completed signed card.",How to Play Human Bingo," Use a standard 5 x 5 square grid (as used in the regular bingo games). Create one card for each person attending the gathering.

Also have pens or pencils for each card.;
, Think of interesting human characteristics, personalities, and life facts for the bingo matches. Some examples could be:

owns or has owned a pet
commutes to school/work
has never smoked before
has gone to a sporting event
has visited another country
has tried a different cuisine outside of their own
has ever won something
has more than two pets
has worked in another state
has a social networking account, etc.

,, You could do this either as you hand out the cards or once everyone has arrived and is ready to get to know one another.

Tell the players that they must interview each other. Have each player go around the group and ask other people to check off one box that applies to them. Names or signatures on multiple boxes won't count.

If your party has a very small amount of people, the signature rules are more lenient and can be signed upon if any trivia applies to the person.


Reinforce that socializing is a must! This entire game is based around getting to know each other, so encourage chatting and getting to know one another.

, Let the players know to come to you when their card is full and you can call out the winner.

Alternatively, you could declare winners when a row (across, up, down or diagonal) has been checked off; this depends on whether you want to speed things up or not.
Offer a small door prize such as a chocolate bar, or a cake, to the winner.

Choose to play another version of the money game.",How to Play Pitch," Pitch requires at least three people, though you can play with more. Typically, a traditional game is played with partners. So, four players are ideal for this game. The dealer shuffles and then deals out six cards to each player. The dealer should hand out the cards in the pattern of 1, then 2, then 3 cards per deal., Once the cards have been dealt, look at the cards you’ve been given. If you’re playing with a partner, look at the cards with your partner. The values for the cards are:


Ten: 10 points.
Ace: 4 points.
King: 3 points.
Queen: 2 points.
Jack: 1 point.

, Every player must now make a bid. How much you bid corresponds to how much confidence you have in the hand you've been dealt. The bidding starts with the person to the left of the dealer, and goes in a circle. You can bid 2, 3, or 4 cards. The bid represents the number of points that you think you will get in this hand. If you aren't confident at all, you may pass, unless you are the last to bid (i.e. the dealer) and everyone else has passed, in which case you have to bid at least 2., Once someone has placed a bid, you have to match them, surpass them, or pass on your turn. For example, you cannot bid two if three has already been bid. The point of bidding is to figure out who is the most confident in their hand, because that is the person who is going to get to choose the trump suit., The points that you can get in pitch are these: high of trump, low of trump, jack of trump, and game. ""High"" is the highest trump card played, ""low"" is the lowest trump card played, ""jack"" is the jack of trump, and ""game"" has to do with how many face cards you end up with., Which suit becomes trump depends on who bids the highest, because whoever bids the highest gets to throw down first. The first card that they throw down becomes the trump suit. Therefore, if you have the ace of spades, the two of spades, and the jack of spades, you probably want to bid four, because then you will get to make ""spades"" the trump suit and you will probably be able to get four points., Whoever bid the highest gets to throw down first. Whichever is the first card that they throw becomes the trump suit. Play continues to the left. Everyone throws down one card. The winner of the ""hand"" is the person who has thrown either the highest card in suit, or the highest trump card. Trump can be played anytime. Trump always beats ""in suit."", The winner of the hand is the player that puts down the trump card or the highest suit. The game continues on until everyone is out of cards. When everyone is out of cards (which should happen concurrently), the cards are tallied up to see who gets points. The winner of the round gets to take all of the cards that he has won., If the highest initial bidder (the person who threw the trump at the beginning of the game) has come up with the points that they bid, he gets those points. If not, he gets negative of those points. Meanwhile, anyone else who scores points gets them free of charge (i.e., if the bidder bid 3, and he got high low and game, he gets 3 points). The person who got jack gets 1 point. If the bidder bid 3, and got high and low, he gets negative three points. Whoever got jack gets a point, whoever got game gets a point. Points are assigned as follows:1 point to the lowest trump card played.
1 point to the highest trump card played.
1 point to the jack of trump.
1 point to ""game."" This is the person with the highest number, if you count the 10 card of any suit as 10 and each jack as 1, queen as 2, king as 3, ace as 4.

, In a traditional game, the game ends when someone reaches 21 games. The game should also end when all of the playable cards have been played. The game may end sooner or later if you are playing a variation of the game.You can choose to make the end of the game be reached at 32 points.

, In this version of the game, players pay for ten cents a point. The players in this version play individually. There are no partners. Players can leave the game after any hand. Ten cents are received for each point that is above average. The players lose ten cents for each point they are below the average.The smudge bid (4 point bid) is called “shooting the moon” in this version of the game. One dollar is received for a successful attempt at shooting the moon.

, There aren’t any partners in this version of the game. Every person plays individually. This version is called “cutthroat” because players are allowed to gang up against the bidder. The goal is to prevent the bidder from making their bid.The players in the game should try to convince the bidder that their bid is not good. This can be done by intimidation, or by bluffing about the bid you are about to make.
Make sure rules are set before the game. For example, determine is insults and swearing will be allowed.

, Another version of the money game is called “Racehorse.” It is usually played by five or more players that are playing for themselves. One dollar is received from each player for each successful bid that is made. If a bid fails, the player that made the losing bid pays one dollar to each player."

Give prizes to the best Big Booty.",How to Play Big Booty," You can play with as few as three people, but no more than fifteen, as it may be difficult to hear each other in too large of a group. Because this is a coordinated group activity, make sure that everyone understands the rules and answer any questions they might have beforehand.Participants may learn best after watching or participating in a few slow rounds. If some people already know how to play, have them do a quick demo game.
Large groups of people can slow down the pace of this game. Due to this, smaller groups are recommended for young children.;
, Assign one player the role of ""Big Booty."" This person will act as the leader of the game. After that, assign each player a sequentially ascending number (1, 2, 3, 4...) with no numbers repeated.


Determining Big Booty is a matter of preference. You could decide this role with a game of rock, paper, scissors or by drawing straws.
Number players starting from Big Booty. Count up for each player to the left or right of Big Booty. When assigning numbers, only do so in a single direction (left or right).
No names except for the ones assigned are used in this game. Each player must remember their assigned role/number. These will change over the course of the game.This game can be boisterous and may attract attention. Onlookers may want to join. If so, add them to the circle as a new highest number., Have Big Booty clap a steady beat. All players should join in with Big Booty. While clapping, all players say together, ""Big booty, Big booty, Big booty, aw yeah!"" Claps should coincide with the bolded parts of the chant. Clapping continues until someone makes a mistake.After the group chant, players perform a one-by-one call and response led by Big Booty:Big Booty: Big Booty, Number 2Player 2: Number 2, Number 5Player 5: Number 5, Number 3Player 3: Number 3, Big BootyAnd so on...

When passing off the chant, callbacks aren't allowed. You cannot call out and pass the chant back to the player who just passed it to you.
Use your own rhythmic combinations. For example, you might clap on the first beat, snap on the second, pat on the third, stomp on the fourth, then repeat., When a player makes a mistake, gets tongue-tied, or interrupts the rhythm, all players respond with ""Aw shoot!"" The player who makes a mistake takes the position of the highest number, players reorganize to their new numbers, then Big Booty starts the game again.


If you start a game with Big Booty and players 1 through 5, players will shuffle between these roles as the game is played and mistakes are made.
There are many variations of response you can use when a mistake is made. For example, you might say, ""Oh snap"" or ""Aw shucks."", For beginners, a simple rhythm, like only clapping, alternating claps and pats, or alternating claps and stomps may be easiest. Have Big Booty start the rhythm at a moderately fast pace.Surprisingly, playing this game too slowly can be just as difficult as playing it at a very rapid speed.

, Big Booty should give some kind of signal to other players that the group chant is about the begin. For example, while speaking to the rhythm, Big Booty might count down, ""We start in 3, 2, 1, Big Booty, Big Booty...""You could also use a gesture, like a head nod or a small hop to indicate when the chant is about to begin.

, Keep your eyes open for players that appear distracted. These are prime targets to pass the chant to. Look at one player while calling out another player's number.

When a player makes a mistake, yell out ""Aw shoot,"" pause the rhythm, and reorganize players., Once players are reorganized and have their new numbers, Big Booty should start up the rhythm again. Do the group chant and then another round of call and response. Play this game for as long as you desire., In this version, even when an error is made the rhythm should continue. When a mistake is made and players say, ""Aw shucks,"" they should do so while in time with the rhythm. Then:


The person who called out the player who made a mistake will pick up the chant and call out a new player.
If the person who called out the player who made a mistake isn't paying attention and they make a mistake, other players must say ""Aw shucks"" again. The person who called out that new out-person must now pick up the chant.

, This is a great variation for more experienced players. After the first few rounds of one-by-one chanting, have Big Booty speed up the rate of their clapping. Continue increasing speed slowly over time until someone makes a mistake.To keep things fair, you may want to decide the amount of rounds you chant before the game speeds up. For example, you might decide that after the fifth one-by-one chant, Big Booty increases speed.
It can be difficult to maintain a steady speed for your rhythm. Use a metronome or a metronome phone app to help keep the beat.

, Where a player would normally say their own number, have them say ""Big Booty"" and equal amount of times. For example, instead of saying, ""Number 2, Number 4"" you'd say ""Big Booty, Big Booty, Number 4.""


This version forces players to pay closer attention, especially Big Booty. If Number 2 passed the chant to Big Booty, they would say, ""Big Booty, Big Booty, Big Booty!""
When playing this version, the second number does not change at all, only your own number when you are chanting yourself., A popular variation of this game uses superhero or pop-culture character names in the place of player numbers. For example, instead of calling ""Number 3,"" a player might say, ""Spiderman"" or ""Princess Peach.""This version works best with smaller groups. It can be difficult to remember the ascending sequence for random heroes and characters in a large group.

, This can add a competitive aspect to this fun group game. Whoever lasts the most rounds as Big Booty gets a special prize. To keep players honest, you may want to have a monitor or referee keep track of who's Big Booty longest.


Simple prizes, like stickers, stamps, gum, and bubbles work great for kids. For older players, try movie passes, gift cards, and more.

This will make it easier to plan out the maze. Once pushed off to the side, start to place desks in a checker pattern (see the image for this step). Next, push a few the desks to make a straight line and start to create the turns.



  Put desks on white.


Make the turns by connecting the desks at the corner to start building in another line.
Maneuver the desks to create a simple yet fun maze. When you run out of desks, resort to putting chairs in the open places.
Have the starting opening on one side and the end right adjacent to it (as best as you can).;
, Set the chairs out in the hallway against the wall so that the contestants can see the chairs that they are going to be writing on or maneuvering from. This is a good marketing technique and it will draw people in to play the game., If you would like to set up the maze with tables or large chairs, that works but it is easiest to use the things that you have in the classroom. Other materials you could use are card tables and folding tables, if this is done at a large event. If it is in a small classroom, and you would prefer to do it outside, use card tables again and make sure that they are placed on the blacktop or concrete. That way, the chairs are still able to roll. You can use almost any type of roadblock to set up the maze.

, Before the players walk in, they must decide who will be pushing the chair through the maze and who will be guiding him/her. The person pushing should know that they are going to be blindfolded as soon as, if not before, they walk in.

Note to leader: It is best to explain the rules at this point so that they both have a good idea of the game before they walk in. It will be a little easier that way.

, When the contestants walk in, one will already be blindfolded and the other will carefully lead them and the chair to the start of the maze. Once there, player 1 (with the blindfold) will stand behind the chair ready to push it while player 2 (without the blindfold) will sit criss-cross on top of the chair. Player 2 must stay like this for the entire game. If he/she reaches out to help his/her partner along, they must stop and wait for 5 seconds before continuing. If player 1 takes off the blindfold or starts to feel around the desks rather than taking directions from his or her partner, then player 1 must also stop for 5 seconds before moving on., When the leader says ""GO"" player 1 will put his or her hands on the back of the chair and push the rolling chair into the maze. During this time, the sitting partner will instruct the blindfolded one through the maze and the leader will start the stopwatch. He/ she can use words like turn right 90 degrees, turn left 90 degrees, forward two steps, backwards one, and so forth., Only one set of partners will go through at a time and the other team will wait outside. They will be called in after the first group has finished. When they finish, the second set will be let in and will have their turn to try the maze. On the other hand, the team currently in the maze must make it all the way through grab the flag turn around and make it back before the stopwatch can stop. The goal is to have the fastest time with the least amount of penalties., If the contestants would like, they can add their names atop the time. At the end of the competition, the top three pairs get candy or another suitable small reward. Third place gets one piece, second place gets two, and first place gets three pieces."

Add money to each pot.

,
Have the dealer begin drawing cards.,
Yell “Po-Ke-No!”.,
Change dealers (and game boards as necessary).,
Repeat steps 5 through 9 until completion of game.",How to Play Po Ke No," Po-Ke-No is a game in which players play for money. In order to be organized and have the game run smoothly it is necessary to label these containers, also known as pots. It is possible to play the game without these containers but it is not recommended. This is because as the game progresses players will begin to add money to each pile respectively and it may be difficult to distinguish one pot from the next. There are several different labels that can be placed on each pot, but there are usually four standard pot labels that are typically used by players universally. The labels for the pots are Corners, Centers, Five in a Row, & Four of a Kind.

Centers is for when a player covers the center space on their game board.
Corners is for when a player covers the four corners of their game board.
Five in a Row is when a player covers five in a row across their game board. This can either be diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
Four of a kind is for when a player has four of the same denomination, such as 4 Jacks.;
, The dealer will be the person who shuffles the cards and draws the cards from the deck., All game boards, mathematically speaking, have the same chance of winning any of the pots. (Although it should be said, some vets of the game find some game boards “luckier” than others.)

At the time of selecting game boards, if there are any game boards left over after everyone, except the dealer, has selected one, the dealer may then select a board themselves and participate along with the other players.

, Each pot can have its own individual value or there can be a uniform value for all of the pots. Pots can range from 1 cent on up. Typically pots are worth no more than 25 cents, as this makes the game more fun. This is because the lower each pot is worth the longer the game can go on.,, The dealer is to draw cards, one at a time, from the top of the deck. As the dealer draws cards, if the card matches one of the spaces on a player’s game board they are to cover it with one of the poker chips. This process of the dealer drawing cards and players covering the corresponding spaces on their game board continues until one of the players’ game boards meets the requirements needed to win one of the pots.

Five in a Row (Horizontal)

Four of a Kind







,

When a player yells “Po-Ke-No!” this is a signal to the rest of the players that they believe they have won one of the aforementioned pots
Before the player can claim the money that is in the pot, it is necessary to go back through the cards that have been drawn and to cross check them with the spaces the winner has covered.

, After the winner of the previous round has claimed their prize, they will then become the dealer for the next round.

It is not required that a person change their game board after initially selecting one at the start of the game, but they may choose to do so if they want.

, The game can go on as long as all the players have money and a desire to play. In the event that all players involved decide to end the game, it can end at that time. Players can count how much money they have at the end of the game and subtract how much they started with to determine who the overall winner was.

In the event that the players want to end the game but still have money in the pots they can do one of two things. They can either divide the money remaining money in the pots evenly amongst themselves or play one final round known as “cover-all.” In the “cover-all” round, all remaining pots are combined and game continues until one player has covered their entire game board.

In poker, the bidding limit increases after the fourth street.;
, First, each player receives two cards facedown. The players may peek at their respective cards. Then they receive a third card that is facing up. The third card is called the door card.Place your bets (the “bring-in”). The player with the highest door card starts the bidding process, or the “bring-in”. This player must place a bet up to the lowest betting increment, which for the purposes of this is example is $1.00. The bidding continues clockwise around the table until all players are done betting. When betting, the rest of the players at the table have the following options:
Check, or pass (this option is only available if a player has not yet placed a bet)
Call, or match the last bet placed (this allows you to continue to play in the hand)
Fold, or leave the hand (if a bet has been placed and you do not want to match it, you would fold)
Raise, or increase the betIf two or more players have the same door card, the suits act as the tiebreak. From worst to best: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades.

, After the betting concludes, each player receives one more card. The card is placed face-up next to the third card., For the rest of the hand, the player with the lowest, or worst, visible hand starts the betting action. They are not required to bet. For the fourth street round, the betting limit remains small. For the purposes of this example, the betting limit remains $1.00. Once again, players have the following options:


Check, or pass (this option is only available if a player has not yet placed a bet)
Call, or match the last bet placed (this allows you to continue to play in the hand)
Fold, or leave the hand (if a bet has been placed and you do not want to match it, you would fold)
Raise, or increase the bet, All remaining players receive one more card. The card is placed face-up next to the fourth card., Again, the player with the lowest, or worst, visible hand starts the betting action. They are not required to bet. For all remaining streets, the betting limit increases to the big bet. For the purposes of this example, the betting limit increases to $2.00 increments. When betting, players have the following options:


Check, or pass (this option is only available if a player has not yet placed a bet)
Call, or match the last bet placed (this allows you to continue to play in the hand)
Fold, or leave the hand (if a bet has been placed and you do not want to match it, you would fold)
Raise, or increase the bet, The card is placed face-up next to the fifth card. This is the last card placed face-up., The player with the lowest, or worst, visible hand starts the betting action. They are not required to bet. The betting limit remains the same as the previous round. For the purposes of this example, players may increase the bet by a maximum of $2.00. When betting, players have the following options:


Check, or pass (this option is only available if a player has not yet placed a bet)

Players may peek at their respective cards before placing bets., Again, the player with the lowest, or worst, visible hand starts the betting action. They are not required to bet. The betting limit remains the same as the previous round. For the purposes of this example, players may increase the bet by $2.00 increments. When betting, players have the following options:


Check, or pass (this option is only available if a player has not yet placed a bet)
Call, or match the last bet placed (this allows you to continue to play in the hand)
Fold, or leave the hand (if a bet has been placed and you do not want to match it, you would fold)
Raise, or increase the bet, All remaining players select and reveal the five cards they wish to use as their hand. The player with the lowest, or worst hand wins the pot. If two or more players have identical hands, the pot is split., In Razz, hands are ranked according to the “Ace to Five” system. The system reverses the traditional Seven Card Stud scoring. Therefore, hands that would win in Seven Card Stud would lose in Razz.


There is no qualifier for the winning hand—the lowest, or worst, hand at the table always wins.
In the case of a tie, the two players split the pot., In Razz, kings are high and aces are low.At the end of a round, every hand is evaluated from high card to low card.


Example 1: Player One’s Hand: 8-6-4-3-2; Player Two’s Hand: 8-6-5-3-2. In this instance, Player One would win because 4 is less than 5.
Example 2: Player One’s Hand: K-J-8-4-A; Player Two’s Hand: Q-J-T-2-A. In this instance, Player Two would win because a Queen is worth less than a King.

, In Seven Card Stud, straights and flushes are high scoring hands. In Razz, these hands do not count against a player. If fact, the best possible hand is 5-4-3-2-A. This is also called “the wheel.”

, In Seven Card Stud, a pair beats a hand of five non-pairs, a triple beats a pair, and a four-of-a-kind beats a triple. In razz this scoring series is reversed. A hand of five non-pairs beats a pair, a pair beats a triple, and a triple beats a four-of-a-kind.


Example 1: Player One’s Hand: 9-8-A-A-A; Player Two’s Hand: K-Q-J-T-9. In this instance, Player Two would win even though their the king is worth more than Player One’s nine.
Example 2: Player One’s Hand: T-T-5-3-2; Player Two’s Hand: 7-7-6-4-3. In this instance, Player Two would win their pair of sevens is worth less than Player One’s pair of tens., In Razz, your starting hand is key. If you have a poor starting hand, you should fold in the first street. Examples of poor starting hands include:


Anything worse than a three-card eight, where eight is the highest card.A hand with a high pair. If your hand contains a low pair, like two aces or two twos, do not fold unless you get a second pair., The cards placed face-up on the table will provide you with a lot of information. Studying these cards will help you determine if the cards you need to make a strong hand are still available.The face-up cards will also tell you about the strength of your opponent's hand.If your opponent has higher cards than you, that is good.
If your opponent has the same cards as you, that is good. You are less likely to draw a pair, triple, or four-of-a-kind.
If your opponent has the cards you want (low cards), that is bad. That means you are less likely to draw a valuable low card., In Razz, you have plenty of opportunities to bluff, especially since four of your seven cards are face-up. For example: the cards in Player One’s hands are high—she’s holding a King and a 10. However, her face-up cards are low—after fourth street, she has a 2 and Ace. She should continue to bet because it looks like she has a great hand. If her bluff succeeds, players with better hands might fold and she could steal the pot."

Whoever makes the highest bid declares the trump suit, which is whatever pattern declared to be worth the most by whoever wins the bid.

, Melding is to lay down combinations of cards to score you points. Pinochle has five different types of melding:


A pinochle is the jack of diamonds and the queen of spades. You can also get a double pinochle by having both jacks of diamonds and both queens of spades.
An around is a set of four cards of the same level (e.g. all aces) in four different suits (diamond, club, heart, space). You can also get a double around (all eight cards of the same level) for 10 times the points. However, arounds and double arounds are only worth points if you have them in aces, kings, queens, or jacks. Tens arounds and nines arounds around do not count for anything.
A marriage is a king and a queen of the same suit (e.g. both clubs). A marriage is worth twice as much in the trump suit (mentioned above).
A run is an ace, ten, king, queen, and jack all in the trump suit. If you have an extra king or queen (or both) in trump, it's worth even more points. But playing a run that's not in the trump suit is worth nothing.
A dix is a nine of the trump suit. A dix is worth 10 points, and gets its name from that fact (""dix"" is French for ""ten""). DOUBLE DECK

, For example, you can have a queen that's part of a marriage and also part of a pinochle, but not part of two marriages or two pinochles at once.

, If their score so far is more than 250 points less than what they bid, they should forfeit, which is called going set. This means that your bid amount is subtracted from the points you've gotten in previous rounds. Going set will make it harder for your team to win, but it is still a better option than going ahead and giving extra points to the opposing team.

, Trick-taking is putting down one of your remaining cards at a time to determine who gets the rest of the points. Each person plays a card, starting with the bid winner, and you must play the same suit as the person before you. If you cannot, you should play a card in the trump suit, and if you have neither of those suits you just play whatever you'd like to get rid of. This continues until all the cards are gone. You will receive 10 points or zero points, depending on what you put down.


The ace, ten, and king are worth 10 points each while the queen, jack, and nine are worth zero. However, a card in the trump suit is always worth more than a card not in trump. So if one person plays a nine in trump and the other three all play aces, the first person wins but nobody gets any points; that's just how it works.
Whoever wins the first trick is the first one to play for the next trick. The winner of that trick will start off the next trick, and so on.
There are 240 potential points to be scored in the trick-taking phase, since in each Pinochle deck there are 24 aces, tens, and kings. Also, whichever team wins the last trick gets an extra 10 points, for a grand total of 250.

, Shuffle the cards and begin again at step 1 until one team reaches 1500 points. This is also the time to trade in players if you have more than four people, or to play different teams if you have multiple games of Pinochle going on in the room.

Get your hands on a Phase 10 deck.,
Find people who want to play Phase 10.,
Find a suitable playing location.",How to Play Phase 101," Unfortunately you can’t play the game if you don’t have the deck of cards. Phase 10 is made and distributed by Mattel Games, the maker of Uno. You can find the card game online at their website . If you don’t want to order online try checking your local game store.;
, You need between two and six people to play Phase 10. It isn’t a single player game so you will need some friends who want to play with you to join in.

, You will want a big table with seats for everyone. The game can get pretty spread out and you are dealing a whole deck so make sure everyone has enough room. If you don’t have a suitable table you can always play on the floor.

"
"
Start with at least three players and no more than six.,
Take a standard deck of 52 playing cards and remove three Queens.,
Choose a dealer.",How to Play Old Maid1," This number of players can easily play using a single deck of cards.


If you have more players, use two decks but make sure the decks look identical.;
, The other Queen will be designated as the ""Old Maid.""


The goal of the game is to avoid being the player who holds the ""Old Maid"" in your hand when all the cards have been discarded.

, The dealer will shuffle the cards and deal the cards as evenly as possible amongst the players.


Some players may have one card more than others. This is fine.

"
"
Recruit players.,
The dealer has a special role in Mao.,
The dealer deals several cards to each player.,
Before play begins, the dealer will typically initiate the game by making an announcement stating who begins play and in which direction play proceeds.

,
Remember: There is no standard set of rules.,
No discussing the rules.,
Some games require you to thank the dealer when you take a penalty card.,
When you only have one card left, you have to call out ""Mao"".,
No delaying the game.,
A player who cannot legally play a card to the discard pile, may instead draw a penalty card.,
Utilize points of order.,
Common triggers are:


Playing a certain card, suit, or rank
Certain combinations of cards on the discard pile
The number of cards remaining in a players hand

,
Common effects are:


Requiring a player to say or do something
Changing the order of play by skipping players, reversing direction, or other methods.,
Choose some or many of the following possibilities to form a part of your game.",How to Play Mao," If a new player asks how to play Mao, you have to tell them it's a frustrating card game and that you can't tell them the rules; they have to find out the specifics themselves. There is no limit to the number of players in a game, but you'll want a deck for every 4 to 5 players, maybe more if you have new players or complicated rules and are likely to need a lot of penalty cards.

, He or she has the authority to initiate the game, choose what rules to use, judge and resolve disputes, and deal with any unusual complications that might arise.


Since the dealer may be the only player who knows all the rules from the beginning of the game, it is critical that he or she enforces them consistently and fairly.
Some groups prefer to have a second player who also knows the rules so that the two of them can call penalties on each other.

, 5 to 8 cards per player is typical, but the exact amount doesn't matter as long as everyone gets the same number. Place the remainder of the deck in the center of the playing area to be used as a stock of penalty cards, then flip one card over and place it next to the deck to start.

,, They vary with every game. Look below for guidelines to figuring out rules for each particular game of Mao.

, In fact, no talking at all except when required by another rule, to call a point of order, or when in the middle of a point of order.;
, Counterintuitive as this seems, you have to do it when mandated or else you'll receive another penalty card.

, The game is similar to Uno in this respect, because you have to alert all the other players that you're close to winning, and if you don't you can be penalized.

, Additionally, no playing out of turn or trying to call a penalty on another player if that player hasn't broken any rules--if you're going to disrupt the game, it's better not to play at all. If a player unintentionally inflicts a penalty on another player because they themselves do not fully understand the rules, any other player except the one penalized can inflict a penalty card on the first player for ""inflicting an incorrect penalty"".

, They will then end their turn by adding this card to their hand.

, A point of order occurs when the game comes to a halt so the players can confer and discuss to clarify certain things about the game, although they still cannot talk about the rules directly. Points of order are an important part of the Mao process, and come with their own rules, which are:


Do not refer to the point of order directly by name (you can get around this by calling it ""P of O"", for example, or simply ""point order"", eliminating the ""of"")
Players must not look at their cards during a Point of order. If they are still holding their cards after someone calls a Point of order, they can be penalized.
The point of order ends when someone calls ""point of disorder"", ""point taken"", or even just ""pick up your cards""
In some variations, only the dealer can start and end points of order; however, you can allow anyone to do so in your game
In another variation, point of order must be said before and after you speak during play. Players who do not do so will be penalized for ""speaking out of turn.""

,,
Requiring a player to draw penalty cards
Changing which cards can be legally played to the discard pile
Requiring a player to make a choice (such as specifying the value of a wild card).

, It's up to you!


Musical Chairs. A Four of Clubs forces everyone to get up from the table, run around once and sit back down in their original spot. The last player to make it back to their spot draws a penalty card.
Deuces. A Two requires everyone to touch their middle and index fingers to the table. The last player to do so draws a penalty card.
Have a Nice Day. A seven requires the next player to draw a penalty card. Sevens can add up, requiring players to draw 2, 3, 4, etc. penalty cards when multiple 7's are played in a row. Whoever plays it must say ""Have a (Very) (Very, Very) (etc.) Nice Day.
Royalty. A King requires a player to say ""All Hail the King (of spades)"". A Queen requires the player to say ""Neeumph"" (Queen of Spades).
Manners. A person must say ""Thank You"" when dealt a penalty card.
Soap. Any cursing results in a penalty card.
Holiday. A six requires a player to say ""Merry Christmas"".
Jacks. A Jack allows a player to change suits (wild card).
Spades. Spade cards must be named when played.
Aces. Aces cause the next player to skip their turn.
Reverse. An eight causes the turn order to reverse.
Rhyme Fest. A nine causes the person who played it to say a word and all other players must say a rhyming word in turn without stating a previously said word. If a player says a non-rhyming word, takes too long to say a rhyming word, or says a previously stated word, he draws a penalty card.
Chauncey. If two identical cards are played in succession, everyone must say ""Chauncey"". The last player to do so draws a penalty card.
Diamonds. If any card with a suit of a diamond is played, the person who played it must say ""Shine bright like a diamond"".
Change of Suit. If a person plays a card with a different suit, but the same letter or number as the previous card played (Thus changing the suit), then the person who played the card that would be changing the suit must knock once on the surface of which the game is being played on (Such as a table).

Learn the terms relevant to the game.,
Learn how you win the game.,
Recognize the 10 phases of the game.",How to Play Phase 102," These are necessary to learn before you get started playing. You don’t have to memorize them all immediately, just keep this sheep handy so that you can refer to it as the game goes on. As you continue playing the terms will start to stick in your memory.


A set is 2 or more cards of the same number
A run is 4 or more cards numbered consecutively (e.g. a 1 card, a 2 card, a 3 card, and a 4 card)
A wild card can be used to complete a phase when a player is missing one of the necessary cards
A skip card allows the player who uses it to choose another player to lose their turn

Hitting lets players discard cards they don't want, so long as they play them immediately after a phase has been laid down; an example of this would be adding red cards to an initial play of 7 red cards (which is phase 8 of the game). However, players are only allowed to participate in hitting if they've already played their own phase for that round, and only when it's their turn.

Going out describes the action of a player getting rid of their whole hand in a round, either by hitting or by using all their cards in their phase. As soon as any player goes out, the round ends and all players discard their cards to be shuffled and dealt for a new round.

, The winner of the round is the first one to go out, or use up all their cards. The winner of each round scores a 0. Scoring is one of the most important parts of Phase 10, since the player with the lowest score at the end of the 10 rounds is the winner. Scoring is calculated at the end of each round. The rest of the players gain points for the cards still in their hands. Cards numbered 1 through 9 are worth 5 points
Cards numbered 10 through 12 are worth 10 points
Skip cards are worth 15 points
Wild cards are worth 25 points

, There are at least 10 rounds in Phase 10 and, consequently, 10 phases of play. The phases are listed below. Phase 1 is 2 sets of 3
Phase 2 is 1 set of 3 and 1 run of 4
Phase 3 is 1 set of 4 and 1 run of 4
Phase 4 is 1 run of 7
Phase 5 is 1 run of 8
Phase 6 is 1 run of 9
Phase 7 is 2 sets of 4
Phase 8 is 7 cards of the same color
Phase 9 is 1 set of 5 and 1 set of 2
Phase 10 is 1 set of 5 and 1 set of 3

"
"
Shuffle and deal a deck of Phase 10 cards.,
Put the rest of the deck down in the middle of the players.,
Start the game with the player to the left of the dealer.,
Stop playing once someone ‘goes out’.,
Continue playing in this manner until someone plays a phase 10 and goes out.",How to Play Phase 103," This should include reference cards describing the 10 phases as well as 108 additional cards--24 red, 24 orange, 24 yellow, 24 green (all numbered), 4 skip cards, and 8 wild cards. Each player should receive 10 cards, which are held so that only the player holding the hand can see which cards they are. , This will serve as the draw pile. Turn over the top card of this pile and set it face-up next to the draw pile. This will serve as the discard pile.

, This player will take the top card of either the draw pile or the discard pile, then choose one of their cards to discard. During the first round, each player is trying complete phase 1 (see above) so they can go out and end the round.

, The round ends and all players score and discard their current hands . Anyone who completed phase 1 in round 1 moves on to trying to complete phase 2, but anyone who could not complete phase 1 needs to do so before proceeding. It is still possible for anyone to win, however; it all depends on who goes out and who ends up with a lot of cards.

, This person is typically considered the winner, although some people play so that the person with the fewest points wins, no matter who ends the game. "
"
Combine two or more groups of Phase 10 into one game by using a process of promotion and demotion.,
Select a similar number of participants to play in each group.,
Promote the winners of the first and subsequent hands along with those scoring the lowest of all players.,
Add spice to the game by giving point penalties for behaviors you outline ahead of the game.",How to Play Phase 104," This is a great way to get more than six people playing at one time. This method will also keep the groups changing each hand, allowing everyone to play together while also participating in separate games.

, For example you could do two groups of four, or a group of five with a group of six, or three groups of five, or anything else you choose. Do this at random so as not to be unfair.

, Demote the players with the highest scores and those who are working on the lowest phases. Hopefully you don't hurt any feelings, but those are the rules of the game!

, These could be things like talking in general, talking to specific people, laughing, coughing, scratching, or anything else you come up with. For example, maybe you make a rule that the highest player is not allowed to talk to the lowest player. If they do speak to one another, you can apply a penalty to the players.

"
,How to Play Phase 105,
"
Remove any pairs in your hand.,
Have the dealer fan out his or her cards to the next player.,
The next player fans out his or her cards.,
Take turns clockwise.,
The person who is holding the ""Old Maid"" card is declared the loser.

",How to Play Old Maid2,"


The pairs should be shown face up on the table so that everyone can see the pairs you had.
If you have three of a kind, you can put down two cards as a pair and leave the last card in your hand.

, Once all the pairs have been removed, the dealer should fan out his or her cards face down towards the person on his or her left.


The player to the dealer's left must take one of the cards and add it to his or her hand.
If the card forms a pair with one of the cards in his or her hand, that pair should go on the table with the rest of the discarded pairs.

, The player who just took a card then fans out his or her cards face down towards the person to his or her left. That person should pick a random card and take it as their own and discard any that are pairs. This should continue clockwise around the table.

, As pairs go down, the Maid should show up as the last card.


Eventually, all the pairs will slowly start to be discarded and players should not have many cards anymore.
Once only the ""Old Maid"" is left, the game is over.

,"
"
Before playing, create a deck with only one rank per player.,
Gather the players around in a circle.,
Play the game.,
When you get a 4-of-a-kind, you must not say anything and put your finger to your nose.,
The dealer status must now be passed on to another player.,
Repeat until a winner is declared.",How to Play Pig (Card Game)1," For example, for a 5 player game, you can make the deck out of only 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces.;
, Choose a person to be the dealer. When you're the dealer, shuffle the deck well and give each player (including yourself) 4 cards each.

,


All players will simultaneously put one of their unwanted cards face down and pass it to the player on their left. Then they will place the face down card from the player on their right in their hand.
Since there are no turns in this game (during the passing stage), there is a 4-card limit on how many cards you can have on your hand at any time. If you have a face down card on your right waiting to be picked up, and you already have four cards, you will need to put down one of your cards first before you can pick up that card.
You can only discard or pick up one card at a time.

, The others must then put the fingers to their noses also. The last player to touch their nose is declared a ""Pig"" and leaves the game.


Since there is one less player in the game, you must remove a rank from the deck before starting the next round.

, A new round begins.

, The winner is the last person to remain in the game.

Stock up on refreshments.,
Load up on pennies.",How to Play Penny Ante," Penny ante is most commonly associated with poker, with pennies serving as the highest bid possible during a given play. However, any card game where wagers and winnings are made can be played as penny ante.


Aside from poker, some games you can play using penny ante include bridge, rummy, hearts or pinochle.
Some states have restrictions or requirements on playing penny ante. Check with your local laws to make sure you are in compliance and not risking a fine.;
, Remove the Jokers if you are not playing them as wild cards. Cut and shuffle the cards. Make sure to choose a dealer who is familiar with the game and is willing to deal for the night.


Choosing a single experienced dealer to serve all night will help keep things moving along at a good pace and keep the game from being bogged down.

, This is where each player puts their ""Ante"" in the middle of the table. In poker this is known figuratively as ""The Pot.""


Despite the name, pennies aren’t strictly required to play penny ante. Matchsticks are a common substitute for pennies that might be more appealing. Other small items suitable for use include small sweets such as jellybeans., Bet in penny increments as the hands are dealt, raising and calling other betters as you go. You may use poker chips if you have them available, but the winnings will be the pennies.


Familiarize yourself with common poker strategy to improve your chances of walking out with pockets full of pennies. Raising, calling, and recognizing tells are essential to successful poker play – even if you aren’t playing for high stakes., Once all of the pennies in everyone else's stash are gone, you can declare a victor. Most of all, have fun! Losing is far less painful when the stakes are low, and fun rivalries can be established without players getting too emotional.


A common poker night can run upwards of 4 to 6 hours, depending on the number of players and skill. Plan ahead if you intend on finishing only when there is a victor.

, Contact your friends and see who wants to play. Penny Ante is a game primarily played for fun, so make sure to mention this when you contact them.


Consider coworkers or other acquaintances that you would like to get to know better when arranging a play date. Few people are unwilling to part with a few pennies, whereas an evening of regular poker can scare away some.
Pick a date and let everyone put it in their calendars. Try using Facebook or other social media sites to set up an event that people can opt into.

, Most games of poker are played around a table at home. Make sure there is plenty of room and enough chairs to support everyone who wants to play.


Invest in a nice table! If you plan on playing penny ante on a regular basis, buying a table that can can fit everyone who wishes to play is a great idea. Certain tables are designed for card games, with surfaces that make picking up cards much easier., Poker parties are casual, so don’t worry about setting up a formal dinner. Instead, pick up plenty of snacks and finger foods. Beer is always appreciated (if not expected), but make sure to provide alternatives for those guests who don’t drink alcohol.Making the party a Bring Your Own Beer (BYOB) party will help alleviate some of the costs associated with throwing a poker night.

, Gather up enough pennies to supply each player with enough to last the night. If you don’t have spare pennies laying around, head to the bank or nearest store and exchange a few dollars for a couple rolls of pennies.


Purchase a set of inexpensive poker chips if you are playing penny ante poker to complete the experience. They represent the ante of the game and help keep track of winnings."

Notice the LAG player's stack, it will be going thru the ceiling. A loose aggressive player can pull off a triple buy-in increase in minutes. In a no-limit tournament a stack could be tripled but this is not likely in a no-limit ring game, but in a limit full ring game this is exceedingly rare.

Gather 4 Players.,
Use a standard card deck.,
Nominate a dealer.,
Know the types of bidding.,
Start the bidding with the person sitting left of the dealer.,
Know that a piggit means you get to pass one card to your partner as they pass you one.,
Understand that a hoggit means that you are stating that you can get all of the tricks by yourself without your partner.,
Have the person that wins the bid lead.

,
Continue the play clockwise.,
Aim for 50.,
Get creative with strategies to try to win.",How to Play Piggit Hoggit," Each player will have a partner. Their partner will sit across from them at the table. Designate one player that will keep score on a pad of paper.;
, Sort it out into a Euchre deck. A Euchre deck contains 24 cards and consists of 9's, 10's, jacks, queens, kings, and aces.

, This person will deal 6 cards to each player beginning with the player on their left and moving clockwise.


It is wise to deal 2 cards at a time to each player to ensure that the cards are shuffled properly. This also leaves less room for cheating.

,


Bidding in a suit. If you decide to bid in a suit, than that suit would be trump for this hand.

For trump, the order of importance is J in the trump suit (right bower), J in the same color that is not trump (left bower), ace trump suit, king trump suit, queen trump suit, jack trump suit, 10 trump suit, and 9 trump suit. This is just like Euchre.


Bidding high. If you decide to bid high, than aces are the highest card for whatever suit is led. This is followed by king, queen, jack, 10 and 9.
Bidding low. If you decide to bid low, than nines are the highest card for whatever suit is led. This is followed by 10, jack, queen, king, and ace.

, This process follows clockwise until everyone has bid once. You can start the bid in any of the three categories, suit, high, or low.


If you decide to bid in a suit, you must state what suit you are choosing.
For example, you announce that you were bidding 4 spades. In order to beat 4 spades you must bid higher or pass. It is not an option to bid 4 of another category after 4 spades has already been bid.
The bidding starts with one through six, piggit or hoggit.
The highest bid that someone can make is a hoggit. Once a hoggit is bid at any point there is no bid higher.

, You can only look at the card after both teammates that won the bid have passed. That card now becomes a part of your hand. After bidding a piggit and passing and receiving a card you must win all six tricks without your partner.


Note: There are many different piggot hands that you can get. The ones listed below are just one example.

, You are not allowed to pass a card. This is equivalent to a loner in Euchre.


Note: There are many different hoggit hands that you can get. The ones listed below are just one example.

,, You have to follow suit. If you do not have the suit that was lead, than you can play any other card.


Whoever wins the trick gets to lead for the following trick.
If a suit is called, the gameplay remains just like Euchre.

, The first team to get 50 points of more will win the game. There are 6 tricks per hand. Each hand you and your partner will get one point for each trick taken, regardless if you won the bid or not.


If you successfully get a piggit, it is worth 12 points.
If you successfully get a hoggit, it is worth 24 points.
If at any time the team that wins the bid does not get as many tricks as they bid, they will get subtracted what they bid. The other team will still receive points for the number of tricks they got.

, There are many different strategies for this game.



Example 1: If Player 1 has the hand on the left and they bid first, they would bid one heart. The reason for this is because they do not have a good hand and they are bidding to give information to their partner. Therefore Player 2, which is the partner of Player 1 knows that their partner has the Jack of Hearts. Player 2's hand is on the right and knowing that their partner has the Jack of Hearts they can use that information and they now know they can piggot.

Example 2: If you had the below hand, you would hoggit high. There are only 6 cards per suit. Knowing that you have three of one suit, you know that there are only three left. Therefore, everyone must follow suit and because you have the top two cards for that suit then you can lead them and hopefully pull out all the cards in your suit making the rest of the cards in your hand for that suit good. The probability that another player also has three cards of the same suit as you is slim, but possible. That means that you are taking a chance by doing this.

Shuffle the deck to mix up the cards before dealing.When dealing, deal one card to each player in succession until every player has the right number of cards.
Always deal in a clockwise direction, starting with the player to the left of the dealer.;
, Turn over the top four cards in the deck and lay them out in a cross-pattern on the table with one card each facing north, south, east, and west.If any kings come up, move them to one of the corners (the open spaces left between the four cards of the cross). Fill the space left by the king with a new card from the deck, face-up like the others.


The piles created by these four (non-king) cards are called the foundation piles.
Place the remainder of the deck in the middle of the four foundation piles.

, In Kings Corners, players hold their cards in their hands, concealed from the other players., There are many methods you can use to determine who will go first in a game of cards, including:


The oldest or youngest person
The person whose birthday is soonest
The person to the left of the dealer
Drawing straws
Rock, paper, scissors

, Each turn begins with the player drawing a single card from the top of the deck.Player one can then begin to discard cards. The object of the game is for each player to try to get rid of all their cards before the other players do.

, There are two ways a player can discard. For one, if a player has a king, they can place the king in an empty corner to start a king foundation pile. Otherwise, a player can discard cards onto any of the foundation piles on the table:


To discard onto any pile, the discarded card must be the opposite color of the top card, and it must be one number smaller.The sequence of cards in the game is king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, ace.So, for instance, on a black king, you could only place a red queen. On a red five, you can only place a black four. On a red two, you can place a black ace.
When a player discards on top of a foundation pile, make sure the cards overlap so all the cards underneath can still be seen.If the last (or only) card in a foundation pile is an ace, nothing can be played on this card: the pile can only be merged with another pile., Any player (when it’s that player’s turn) can merge piles on the table if the cards complete the sequence. Once a foundation pile has been moved, the player who moved it can fill the empty space with any card or card sequence from their hand.


To merge piles, they must match the red-black alternation, and the pile on top must complete the numeric sequence. For instance, if you have a foundation pile containing a six, five, and four, you can place those cards (in that sequence) on top of another foundation pile with a seven as the top card, as long as the seven and six from the separate piles are opposite colors.
When a pile is completed and contains all the cards from king to ace, that pile can be shuffled back into the deck in the center., When player one has discarded all the cards possible, merged any possible piles, and filled the space with any empty cards, it is time for player two to have a turn, followed by any subsequent players, before play returns to the original player.


Always remember to pick up one card at the beginning of each turn.
Player two is to the left of player one, so that the game is played in a clockwise direction.
When it’s any player’s turn, if they cannot discard after drawing from the deck, play passes on to the next player.
When the center deck runs out, continue playing without drawing cards., Since the object of the game is to discard all your cards, the game is over as soon as a player is able to discard every card from their hand, including the last card picked up at the beginning of the final turn.

, In some versions of the game, players only draw a card if they cannot go, and do not pick up a new card at the beginning of each turn., Kings Corners can be played with multiple rounds, so that when one player goes out, penalty points are allotted based on the cards left in the other players’ hands, and then another round is played.Allot 10 points for every king left in a player’s hand and one point for every other card.
The game ends once a player reaches or exceeds a certain score, such as 25 or 50 points.
When a player does reach or exceed the given score, the player with the fewest points wins.

, As another form of keeping score, you can also use poker chips that get paid into a communal pot, and the player who wins each hand wins the pot. In this case, each player would start with the same number of chips, such as 50 each, for instance.To begin every round, each player puts one chip into the pot.
If any player has a turn but cannot discard any cards, that player pays another chip into the pot.
You can also play so that players have to pay a chip for each card left in their hand at the end of each round, similar to the point system (10 chips for a king and one chip for every other card).

Learn the following rules and order of the game: Each round, the dealer deals a certain number of cards (from a full deck, jokers removed) to all the players, including himself.,
After dealing, the dealer takes the remaining deck and cuts it.,
Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, players begin to bid how many tricks they can take.,
The player to the left of the dealer plays first.,
Once all cards have been played, the dealer tallies up the score.,
The player to the left of the dealer deals the next round.,
The game continues until the cards can no longer be divided equally among all the players, or until someone reaches a score of 100.

",How to Play Oh Hell (Card Game)," One card is dealt in the first round, two in the second, three in the third, etc.;
, The suit of the card he draws becomes trump (see below) for that round.

, A player may bid any number between zero and the number of cards dealt that round. The dealer records the bids on a score sheet. When it comes his turn to bid, he may not bid so that the sum of the bids of all the players is exactly equal to the number of cards dealt. If the sum of the bids is exactly equal to the number of cards, there is a chance that there will be no loser.

, All subsequent players must follow suit (see below). The player who wins the trick leads the next hand, if there is one.

, If a player takes the exact number of tricks he bid, he receives 10 points, plus the number he bid. For example, if Jane bid 0 and took 0 and Ricardo bid 5 and took 5, Jane's score would be 10 and Ricardo's would be 15. If a player takes any other number of tricks, he receives no points. For example, of Hilda bid 3 but took 2, and Naomi bid 1 but took 3, both would receive a score of 0.

, One more card is dealt.

Shuffle the small cards (carrot cards, water cards and cabbage cards) separately and put them off to the side but where everyone can reach them.,
Mix the starter deck and yellow booster deck together.,
If someone plays a feed the bunny card on you, you have to spend your bunny money on cabbage and water for your bunny or your bunny dies.,
Play immediately cards are cards for the middle of the game.,
To do something nice for yourself, you can play the pick a carrot card.,
To sum it all up here is basically what you do: 1) flip   2) draw  3)slide  4) replace

",How to Play Killer Bunnies," Then take the Kaballa's  market starter card and big carrot cards and place them next to the small cards.;
, Give everybody seven cards each. If you have Kaballa  Dolla (bunny money)  put it off to the side on your save pile. If you have play immediately cards put them in your discard pile. Be sure you have a bunny. If you do not have one replace one of your cards you have with a bunny drawn from the deck.


The Killer Bunnies game consist constantly of planning out two moves at once before anything happens. You first place a bunny down face down, vertically. Then you place a run card down for your first move and below that, a second run card down for your second move. Last take a card from the deck to replace your last card that you placed down. Once every one is done planning, flip your bunny card over. The player that goes first, will try to kill your bunny. When a bunny killer(run) card is placed on your bunny, you have to roll the dice. If you roll less than the weapon level, your bunny will have to go to your discard pile. If you roll higher than the weapon level than you get to keep your bunny. (Remember: After you place a card down draw a new card from the deck.)

, This way, spending bunny money lowers your chance of winning the game because it lowers your money of spending on a carrot. Now, if you have water or carrot left, you should keep a record of how much supplies left. So next time some one pulls a feed the bunny card on you, you can discount some of your supplies off or not have to pay at all.

, To use this card,You need to not have one of your own bunnies at place or it will kill them. If you pull one of these cards up and have a bunny at place you need to put it in the discard pile. And Remember you have to play this card from your hand immediately  if you are going to play it at all. 

, This allows you to get a free carrot at the market. You can also play a free water card on your self to get a water card free.

To win a round, one member of a team must acquire four cards of the same rank.,
Before beginning the game, work out a signal with your partner.,
Deal out four starting cards to each player.,
The first person to go draws a card from the pile.,
Play proceeds around the table until someone yells ""Kent!"".,
The first group to spell out K-E-N-T is the winning team.",How to Play Kent," The other member of that team then has to recognize that their partner has collected four of a kind by saying ""Kent!"" (or ""Kemps!"" or ""Pickle!"", depending on the version of the game).;
, This could be something as simple as blinking several times in a row, or you could use something more complex, like clearing your throat and crossing your arms a certain way. Now sit across from your partner so that you can easily make eye contact with them.

, Place the rest of the cards in the middle of the table so that all the players have access to them.

, If they have a matching card in their hand, they discard one of their other cards to be replaced by the new card. If they don't, they will typically set the new card back down.

, If that team has 4 cards of the same rank, they win the round and receive the letter K.


If you think that another team is about to call Kent, call out ""Cut!"" or ""Counter-Kent!"". This will result in you winning the round instead.
If you think you and your partner both have four cards of the same rank, you can say ""Double-Kent!"" and get twice as many letters, for example, a K and an E in the same round. (You should probably have a different signal for Double-Kent than for regular Kent, so make sure you and your partner are on the same page at all times.)

, In some variations the team has to spell out a longer word or take extra measures to win a round, but this is the simplest version of Kent, so just follow the steps here and you should be fine. Good luck!

To be able to play KEMPS you will need:


One large table, preferably circle but any even-sided table will do.,
The four players must pair up to form 2 teams.,
The objective of KEMPS is for at least you or your partner to get all 4 of a kind, KEMPS.

,
To win the round, when a player has four of a kind their partner has to call out ""KEMPS"".,
If a player calls KEMPS and their partner doesn't have only EXACTLY 4 of a kind in their hand then other team gains a letter.

,
If you and your partner both have KEMPS in your hands, then you and your partner can call out ""Double KEMPS"" to win 2 letters.

,
If you believe that a player on the other team has 4 a kind then you can call ""Counter KEMPS"" to win the round, the other team loses a letter.,
A player or the dealer must shuffle the deck and deal each player 4 cards face-down.,
To start the game the dealer must flip 4 cards face-up on the table.,
The players can only touch the cards when all four are touching the table.,
Players can discard any cards or pass any cards to their partner that they choose as long as they are face-up on the table.,
All players must then agree to discard 4 cards.,
Repeat these steps until a team wins the round.,
If players believe that the match is a draw then they should show their cards to the dealer to determine if the match is in fact a draw.,
Players can only show cards to their partner if they don't have KEMPS but players can pass their partner KEMPS face-up across the table.

,
Cards can only be passed face-up.,
Players can not snatch cards out of another player's hands unless they are in contact with the table as well.

,If a player calls KEMPS and their partner has more than 4 cards in their hand or doesn't have 4 of a kind then the opposing team wins the letter.",How to Play Kemps," Table must be large enough so that partners can't touch each other from across the table.
At least one standard deck of 52 cards,
Exactly 4 players and 1 dealer.;
, The 2 partners must sit directly across from each other and perpendicular to the other team.

,, After winning a round, you get a letter of the word KEMPS. The game is won when a team collects all 5 letters.

,,, To successfully call counter KEMPS, at least one player on the opposing team must have exactly only 4 of a kind in their hand.

, The deck is then held by the dealer.

, The cards must be either all in the middle of the table or one in front of each player.

, If a player touches the cards too early then the touched cards must be put back in place until the fourth card touches the table.

, The other players may take or snatch any cards that are touching the table even if another player is touching them this applies to cards that fall on the floor as well.

, Discarded cards are removed from play for the rest of the round. More cards can only be flipped when 4 cards are discarded and each player has 4 cards in their hand. The dealer can flip the cards when all players are ready.

Buy the cards you want to use.,
Select your tatami mat.,
Clear out a space to play.,
Find and choose a reader.,
Shuffle and deal the ""grabbing"" cards.,
Shuffle the ""reading"" cards.,
Flip the ""grabbing"" cards over.,
Situate your body positions.,
Memorize the position of each of the ""grabbing"" cards.,
Say what the first reading card says.,
Touch one of the grabbing cards.,
Keep the card you touched first.,
Penalize the players.,
Repeat the previous steps.",How to Play Karuta," Traditional karuta cards come in two forms: yomifuda and torifuda. Yomifuda, or ""reading cards,"" are cards with information (clues) written on them in Japanese. Torifuda, or ""grabbing cards,"" are cards with written Japanese information on them pertaining to the clue cards. Both yomifuda and torifuda cards come in decks of 100 cards. In order to play, you will need one deck of yomifuda cards, and one deck of torifuda cards.These can be bought off of popular sites such as Amazon and/or Ebay, as well as traditional Japanese specialty shops.
Karuta is a great time to improve your Japanese reading and speaking skills. However, if you do not know Japanese, and have no interest in learning it, you can find versions with the language you speak.
If you so choose you can also avoid karuta cards all together and replace them with traditional playing card decks. Because the sets come in decks of 52, you will need one playing card deck to replace the ""reading cards"" and one deck to replace the ""grabbing cards."";
, A tatami mat is a traditional small rug which is often used for ceremonies. During the game of karuta, each player positions his or her body on the mat. Japanese style tatami mats can be found at online retailers, or Japanese specialty shops. However, you can also replace the rug with something more widely available, such as a small rug, or yoga mat.Note that rugs are not necessary to play the game. It is traditionally thought that the originators of the game played on tatami mats. The use of the mats in today's game is mostly for aesthetic purposes, to feel as if you are playing a truly ancient game.
If you buy, or cut, your own rug, make sure it is large enough to cover your knees, lower legs, and feet, as you will be bent down on them as you play. If you are going to buy a precut mat, measure the distance from your knees to your feet before you make any purchases.

, You will need at least a 4X6 foot space to lay out the cards, and position both of the player's bodies. A normal kitchen table will work just fine if you are sitting in chairs, rather than the floor. If you do use the floor, as is traditionally done, make sure that the space is cleared so you have plenty of room.Whether you use the floor or the table, they both need to be cleaned beforehand. This means vacuuming the carpet, and wiping off the kitchen table. You do not want your bodies, or the cards to get dirty.
Remember that you will also need a spot for the reader to sit as well. Note that the reader must be equidistant from both players, so a cleared spot favoring one player will not do.

, While you may have someone else to play with, you need a third person. This person will read the ""reading"" cards and speak what they say. This person could be a friend, or a relative. They should have a clear speaking voice, and have no rooting interest. One of the players cannot be the reader as that would give him or herself a distinct advantage over the other player.Inform the potential reader that a traditional match only lasts 5-10 minutes. If the players only want to play once, the reader will not have to take much time out of his or her day.

, For more information on how to shuffle a deck of cards, please visit this link: How to Riffle and Bridge Shuffle. After you have shuffled the cards, give the deck to the reader. The reader will deal the cards, giving a card to each player, one at a time, until each player has 25 cards. The other 50 cards in the deck of ""grabbing"" cards will not be used.Note: If you are using decks of regular playing cards, ""grabbing"" and ""reading"" cards are the same. Use a regular deck of playing cards, shuffle them, and give each player 26 cards.

, To learn how to shuffle, please visit: How to Riffle and Bridge Shuffle. After the cards are shuffled, the reader will take the deck, and place it face down next to him or herself. All 100 reading cards are used in the game, so there is no reason to discard any.Note: If you are using decks of regular playing cards, ""grabbing"" and ""reading cards"" are the same. Shuffle one deck of playing cards (minus the jokers) and place them next to the reader as stated above.

, Each player will flip over their 25 ""grabbing"" cards so that they are face up. Each player will then arrange the cards so that they are in three, roughly equal rows. Rows of 8, 8, and 9 are usually used. Each row should have a 1 cm gap in between them.The cards should not go past the size of the tatami mat, or roughly 87 cm wide.
Each opponent's territory should be no more than 3 cm away from one another's.

, Each player should either sit or crouch (both should be doing the same thing). They should position themselves no closer than 1 foot away from their territory. Each player's position should also be equidistant to the position of the reader., Each player has 15 minutes to memorize the position of the grabbing cards. Note: when playing the game, you will have to touch cards on your territory, as well as cards on your opponent's territory. Make sure to memorize your opponent's cards as well as your own., The reader picks up the top reading card of the reading card deck. The reader than says loudly, slowly, and clearly, what the card says. That card is then discarded. The reader then waits until the players have touched one of the grabbing cards to continue on with the game.If you are using regular playing cards, read the type of card. For example, ""Ace of spades.""

, Once the reader has stated what was on the reading card, it is then the players' turn. It is the players' job to find the grabbing card which corresponds with the clue given on the reading card. The correct grabbing card could either be on your side, or your opponent's side. The second you see the card, touch it before your opponent touches it.If you are using regular playing cards, find the playing card which matches with the reading card. For example, if the reader calls ""Ace of spades,"" find the ace of spades.

, The player who touches the correct card first gets the point. He or she places the card next to them, away from the playing field. You will form a pile of cards as the game goes along. Each of the cards is worth one point., If a player touches a card that is not the correct card, they forfeit their next turn. They must place their hands on their head as the next turn commences. You also forfeit your next turn if the reader catches you out of position. This might mean that you are leaning, while your opponent is seated properly., The reader picks up a card and reads it out loud. The players choose the correct corresponding grabbing card. Whichever player touches the correct card first gets to keep the card, and therefore gets the point. After all of the grabbing cards have been recovered, the reader counts up all of the cards for each player. The person with the most cards at the end wins the game."
"
Know the ranks.,
Learn the terms.,
If drinking, establish the applicable rules.,
Designate the necessary cards.",How to Play King and Asshole1," The name of the game comes from its ranking system. Since there are so many variants, there are many options. Before you start playing, establish the ranks you'll be using. You'll need enough for each person (and at least 3 players).


President or King - The winner of the previous round
Vice President (""VP"") or Minister - Second place
Vice Scum or Asshole - Second to last place
Scum or Asshole - Last place in the previous roundYou can use as many titles as you like, depending on the number of players you have. If you have a whole mess of players, consider including titles like Secretary (one below VP), Citizens, Peasants, or Average Joes. Some people choose to use the presidential line of succession, ending with a Clerk (right before the Scum).

;
, As you begin playing, you'll see that each time a player lays a card, there's an accompanying term. Familiarize yourself with the terms for efficient play.


Single - when only one card is laid down
Double (Dub) - a pair of cards of the same value
Triple (Trip) - three cards of the same value
Quadruple (Quads) - four cards of the same value
Kicker - a single card played with a four-of-a-kind to make it a bomb (in some variants)
Clear/Table - If someone plays a hand and every other player passes, the table is cleared. The cards then get removed and the same player starts again, laying whatever card they choose. And if that player gets rid of all their cards, the next person who can beat the hand gets the next turn. If no one can beat the hand, it clears to the next player in line., Not only will you have the basics of the game, but the rules to drink need to be established as well. The following are known examples--you can get as creative as you are able.


The card that matches the number of players present is usually referred to as the ""social."" When laid, all players must drink twice. It can be played on any card and two socials (or even three) can be laid back to back. The next player then plays on the card that was laid before the ""social.""
If a player passes, he or she must drink. Sometimes this is limited so it only applies if anyone else can play before the pile is cleared.
If a player lays a card of the same rank as the previous card, the next player loses their turn and subsequently drinks. For example, if player 1 lays down a 4 and player 2 lays down a 4, player 3 loses their turn and must drink. If a 4 is played again by player 4, player 5 is skipped and drinks., While it's not imperative, you can choose cards that have specific functions. This can add an element of chance to a game with players of different ability levels.


Some players like to choose a card that automatically clears the board. If laid down, the trick starts over and that person begins with whatever card they please. This is usually a 2.
In addition, designate a wild card (usually a 3) that can take the place of any other number (except the clear card).
Instead of having the person left of the dealer start, have the person holding a specific card (4 of clubs, for example) begin.

"
"
Deal the cards.,
Start with a low card.,
Continue the ""tricks.""",How to Play King and Asshole2," The Asshole deals one deck of cards (without the jokers) clockwise to the left, starting with himself and proceeding in order of player hierarchy from low to high until all cards are dealt (presuming the participants are sitting in order). This ensures that the King begins with the fewest number of cards if the hands are uneven. Some parties may wish to sit in order each round to make it easier.


At the first round, anyone can deal. If there is an uneven number of cards to be had, roll a die to see who gets the fewest.
In certain variants, the Asshole must hand over his two best cards to the King. If there is a Vice Asshole or Asshole Jr., he must hand over 1. The King and VP then hand over 2 and 1, respectively, of their worst cards.

, Either the player to the left of the dealer or the player with a designated card (4 of clubs, say) begins the ""trick"" (like in Spades or Bridge). The next player can either lay the same card, a higher card, or a pair, three, or four of the same or higher card. With each turn, the value of the cards gets higher and higher until no one can play.


Each player must at least lay the same number of cards. If 2 threes are laid down, the succeeding play must be either 2 threes or 2 fours, etc. Of course, 3 or 4 of the same card is doable as well.
If a player cannot go, they pass. They can still play in the same round--they are just opting to pass that specific turn. If all players cannot go, the hand is cleared and the last person to lay a hand down starts again.

, As the rounds progress, each player is holding fewer and fewer cards. When one runs out, they become King. That player then sits happily while the rest fight to the death not to become the Asshole. To make the game go more quickly, however, you may count each player's cards after the King is established to assign roles.If keeping score, the players get points depending on their position - for example 2 for the President, 1 for the Vice President and nothing for the others. More importantly, the players of higher status are entitled to enjoy and generally abuse their power over the lower ranking players."
"
Establish extra rules about passing.,
Play with runs.,
Have the King make obnoxious rules.",How to Play King and Asshole3," There are a number of alterations you can make to the general idea of passing. A couple extra regulations are common:


Some people play that if you can beat the previous play, you must. Passing is only allowed if you are unable to play. Typically, this makes the game less interesting and doesn't allow for strategy.
Some people do not allow a player who has passed to play at subsequent turns during the same trick. If you pass, you must wait until someone wins the trick and leads again. This can get rather boring for the person with an incredibly bad hand.

, If the people who play before you lay a 5 and then a 6 consecutively and you put 7, you can call ""runs."" Then the next cards will be forced to go in sequence, 5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A. If anyone can't contribute in order, they will be dropped out of the round.

, If you're playing this as a drinking game, you may want to up the ante. Odds are the King will want to search the depths of his mind for the most annoying, abuse-of-power rules out there, but here are a few to start off with:


Thumb Master: When the King puts his thumb down on the table, everyone must immediately follow suit. The last person to do so must drink.
Anyone who makes eye contact with the King must drink.
Before the hand starts, someone must give the King a toast (this is an opportune time to kiss-ass to the King). If no toast is presented, the King can give out his own punishment.
The King designates a player (or commands that the Asshole do so) to get everyone's drinks as long as he is ruler of the land.

Know the basics.,
Set your number ""2"" pieces in the front.,
Place your flag.,
Place your traps.,
Place your ""10"" and ""1"" piece.,
Place your ""3"" pieces.,
Place your other pieces.,
Maintain eye contact.,
Focus on the back of the board.,
If you hit a trap, explore around it.,
If your opponent willingly sends something towards your ""10"" piece, retreat.,
Focus on defense.,
Hopefully you won your game!",How to Win at Stratego,"


Know that the flag is the most important aspect.
Know that traps stop everything except the piece with the number ""3"" on it.
Know that pieces with the number ""2"" can move any number of spaces in one direction.
Know that pieces with the number ""3"" and ""3"" only diffuse traps.;
, These pieces will be your scouts on the front line. Because they can move any number of spaces in one direction, they should get a position on the front lines. This also is a distraction to your opponent. Your opponent will think that one of the scouts is your flag, creating a red herring.

, It is recommended that you place your flag behind a natural boundary, so you will have to use less traps. Also, most people usually put their flag in the back, so doing this will throw your opponent off.

, Surround your flag with one layer of traps. Scatter the rest of the remaining traps.

, Your ""1"" piece could also be a letter, most commonly ""S"". It is recommended that you put the ""1"" and ""10"" piece next to each other in the second or third row.

, It is recommended that you place these pieces behind the ""2"" pieces. If you find a tram with the ""2"" pieces, you can disarm in with a ""3"" piece.

, These pieces can be placed anywhere you want.

, This is important! You can get ""hints"" from your opponent by doing this.

, This is where their flag will most likely be.

Make a “7 trap.” A 7 trap is a name for a very specific strategic move where you position your disks in a configuration that resembles a 7, with three horizontal disks connected to two diagonal disks branching off from the rightmost horizontal disk.,
Build a septuplet attack.",How to Win at Connect 4," One basic strategy for Connect 4 is to have disks in the middle, because this opens up the most opportunities for you to make connections. Because there are an odd number of columns, having disks in the middle means you can make connections in any direction.If you are player one, put your first disk in the very bottom center slot. If you're player one or two, try to get as many disks into the center column as possible.;
, Just like in chess, moves in Connect 4 can force you or your opponent to make a reactionary move to block a win. Situations like this can be used to your advantage, so it’s important when you're planning a move to think ahead about how your opponent will react.For instance, if you want to ensure you get the chance to put a disk in a particular slot, you can set yourself up for a possible win somewhere else on the board. Then, your opponent will be forced to block your win, leaving your next move free to fill the slot you were initially after.
Similarly, before you make a move, look at how it could impact your opponent positively. You don’t want to make a move that will set your opponent up to win, so think ahead about how your opponent will be able to use your move.

, A very basic strategy of any game is that if you don’t want to lose, you must prevent your opponent from winning. In Connect 4, this means defending against your opponent’s tactics and placing your disks in the open spots that would allow them to complete a four-disk connection.When possible, prevent your opponent from making a three-disk connection, because this means they are one connection away from winning.
Moreover, preventing three-disk connections will also prevent your opponent from setting a trap for you, which is when a game can be won in multiple directions but only blocked from one.

, In Connect 4, a mistake is failing to block an opponent’s moves, thereby allowing the opponent to win. To prevent this, you have to pay attention to the board and the implications of each move so you can take advantage of mistakes.For instance, if you have three disks lined up in a horizontal line and your opponent doesn’t put a disk on top to block you, your next move will be to take advantage of the open slot and complete your four-disk connection to win.

, While it’s important to play defensively and block your opponent, to win at Connect 4 you must also establish connections with your own disks. You can do this by:


Building rows outward in a horizontal fashion.
Stacking disks on top of each other to form vertical connections.
Using your disks and your opponent’s disks to make diagonal connections with your rows and columns.
When possible, place your disks in slots that will create multiple connection possibilities. For instance, if you have disks that are separated by a column or row, find an intermediate slot that will connect the disks and give you opportunities in a diagonal and horizontal or vertical direction., In Connect 4, a threat is an empty space adjacent to a three-disk connection that could win the game. Sometimes, these threats can't be used because there are open spaces around them, and you should avoid filling these spaces with your disks, because this could lead to your opponent making a game-ending move.


Similarly, if you're trying to set up a win but need the space below your threat filled, don’t fill it with your own disk, or your opponent could block your win.

, There are over four trillion ways that any game of Connect 4 can play out, and this means it’s impossible to memorize the right move in any given scenario. However, practicing will improve your strategy skills and your ability to plan and react to certain moves.


There are many online and computer games that you can play, or you can study particular boards to help you practice your strategy., This is when you position your disks so that you have a three-disk connection that could be expanded to a connect-four in multiple directions, meaning your end-game move could be in one of several slots.When this happens, you put your opponent in a position where only one direction can be blocked, leaving the others direction free for your end-game move.
This method does require planning, and sometimes depends on your opponent making a mistake or not noticing that you're setting up a trap.

, The 7 can actually be configured in any way, including right way, backwards, upside down, or even upside down and backwards.
This disk formation is a good strategy because it gives you multiple directions in which you can make a connect-four.

, The septuplet attack is similar to the multi-directional attack, but on a much larger scale. As the name suggests, this strategy sets you up to win in one of seven directions. To execute it, you need to create a very specific configuration with your disks, and will need to control:The bottom center disk.
On the second row from the bottom, the slots one in from either side.
On the third row from the bottom, the three center slots (in a horizontal configuration).
On the center column, the fourth and fifth slots up from the bottom.

Keep good notes on the clues you collect.,
Pay attention to the suggestions other players make.,
Watch other players as they check items off on their lists.,
Pay attention to what card names are being said over and over.",How to Win a Game of Clue Without Technically Cheating1," As you play Clue, you will gather clues that will help you to determine the suspect, weapon, and location of the murder.To keep track of the clues you collect, you should keep good notes and include the initials of the players who have each of the clues you collect. Doing so will help you to get closer to the truth and win the game.Make sure that you check off clues on your detective's notes sheet or write them on your notepad as you collect them.;
, Your opponents will also be searching for clues to solve the murder, so it is a good idea to pay attention to their suggestions. Just keep in mind that they may try to throw you off sometimes, so be careful not to consider all of their suggestions as clues.

, If another player shows them a card, secretly watch where the first person writes the X down on the paper. If he writes it low on the sheet of paper, it is a room. If he writes it at the top, it means he was shown either a weapon or a character.Try to become familiar with the layout of the detective’s notes sheet so that it is easier for you to tell what your opponents are marking off.
Try flipping your sheet upside down to throw off other players who may be watching you as well.

, If a card keeps getting suggested and no one seems to have it, then it may be in the envelope. Make a note of it on your detective’s notes sheet, but try not to be obvious about it. Write it down a little after the name suspect, weapon, or room was mentioned."

Be prepared.,
Run practice missions.,
Have your spy skills up to date.",How to Spy on Family Members in Your House," Spies always plan in advance. Get familiar with every room in the house, and make maps of where everything is. This will help you if your family member does something out of the ordinary, and it will also help you in the long run for further missions.;
, When no one's in the house, or in the room you're going to spy in, practice. Does the person you're spying on have good hearing or seeing? Can they see you from certain angles in your hiding place? All of these questions have to be answered if you want a successful mission. Make sure you answer ""yes"" to all of these questions before you do something stupid and get yourself caught.

, Make sure you have some type of spy gear, like hidden cameras or an erasable tape recorder. Also, before you do something big, sneak up on your ""victim"" a few times. Let's say your mother calls you to lunch. Take a path behind where she is and sneak up on her and say, ""I'm right here."" If you can do that, you can do anything. Also, make sure you:


Are you quiet when you walk/crawl. Think about wearing socks for quieter footsteps.
Are you able to breath silently through your nose
Are you able to see well in the dark
Have at least 2 backup plans
Can you move very fast quietly
Wear clothing that will help you blend in to your hiding spot

"
"
Keep your clues a secret.,
Try to throw your opponents off.,
Watch your body language to avoid giving away clues.",How to Win a Game of Clue Without Technically Cheating2," Never tell anyone that you know or have a hunch. They will be able to gather clues to your suspicion by the questions you ask. For example, if you admit to almost know who did it, then in your next turn you ask to see the Colonel Mustard card, people will believe you think it is Colonel Mustard and you were checking to make sure it was him., Clue is about detecting the truth, but it is also a game of deception. To deceive your opponents, try pretending that you have a hunch and suggesting a suspect or item that you have in your hand. This will make your opponents consider that item and give you more time to detect the truth., Your body language may give away answers about what cards you have or how close you are to winning the game. Try throwing them off by using body language that suggests that you are not doing well. This will help to take their attention off of you.


For example, if you are winning, try slouching over and looking frustrated.

Watch for word endings that may give you a higher score.,
Split long words into smaller ones.,
Check for word reversals.,
Memorize the most common Boggle word beginnings.,
Ignore the timer.,
Take a deep breath and stay calm.,
Let the words flow.,
Keep looking if you get stumped.,
Keep in mind that long words get higher scores.,
Try to find uncommon words.,
Disregard duplicate words.",How to Win at Boggle," Plurals and words that end in -er, -ed, or –ing are good score boosters. Watch for these variations of words that you find. You won’t always find them, but when you do you will increase your score., If you find a long word, make sure that you also break it into its smaller components to maximize your points. For example, if you find the word “snowing,” then you should also add snow, now, wing, owing, and win to your list., Sometimes words make other words when they are spelled backwards. For example, the word “reed” can be turned into “deer” when you spell it backwards. Check your words for reversibility as you record them and write down any reversals that you find., Although your fellow players are likely to find the common words on the board, it is a good idea to know the most common Boggle word beginnings so that you can watch for them and try to make longer words out of them.Some of the most common Boggle word beginnings include:over-
char-
stra-
scar-
comp-
quin-
rese-
stri-
gall-
outs-

, Although you may be tempted to watch the timer or keep checking it to see how much time is left, resist this urge. If you are always watching the timer, then you will lose precious time that you could be looking for words. Do your best to ignore the timer and just focus on the Boggle board., If you are flustered, then it will be harder to find words. Try your best to stay calm as you play Boggle. Try taking a deep breath before you begin the game and at any time during the game when you feel overwhelmed or anxious.Remember that you are playing the game to have fun! Try your best to just enjoy yourself and you may find it easier to focus.

, Sometimes you may want to look for difficult words rather than noticing the words that are right in front of you, but this is a mistake. Don’t censor yourself when you are playing Boggle. Just write down every word that you notice, even if you are unsure if it is spelled correctly or if it is a real word., Sometimes you won’t see any words right away, but don’t assume that there are no words and give up. They might just be less common or longer words that will take some time to find. Keep looking for words until time is up., While short words are easier to find in Boggle and you will find more short words than long ones, try to find as many long words as you can. The longer the word, the higher the score. For example, a seven letter word earns 5 points, while a four letter word only earns 1 point., In Boggle, words that more than one player finds are crossed off and do not count towards your score. Therefore, it is a good idea to look for less common words. Of course, you should write down any and all words that you find, but uncommon words are more likely to count towards your score in the end., You cannot claim credit for the same word twice, even if it is in two places on the board. Therefore, don’t waste your time writing down duplicate words. Just keep looking for new words and disregard the duplicate words."

, Clothing is situation-sensitive. It is always a good idea to stay in the shadows, so olive drab or dark blue is a good color for shadows. Don't use black because it can ""cut out"" your shape in the dark. Camo for the type of environment you are in is even better because in the shadow it looks black, and when in minor light you can blend in with trees, bushes or grass.


You also don't want to wear clothes that make noise. DO NOT wear anything that has buttons or anything that jangles around. Also, don't bring your keys with you! If you must bring your keys with you, remove all extras and wrap remaining keys in a cloth and separate them.

, Shoes matter too. The type of shoes you wear should reflect how far along you are in your stealth training. If you are just beginning, soft shoes with light rubber coating on the bottom is the best. As you become better, you can wear normal shoes, and eventually boots that have soft rubber on the bottom. If inside or outside try to go barefoot as much as possible because it minimizes noise. If you are walking on grass it may tickle your feet but it is better than being captured.

, If you know where you're going and what obstacles you'll face, you'll be much better prepared. Identify hiding spots. Check where anybody could still be awake.

, Map out all of the creaky floors and objects, these are the things that give you away. Also stay very close to walls. It will reduce the creaking sound. draw a map of the house and put a letter or a number on the creaky and squeaky. If you have room, write notes at the bottom of your map.


Walk as close to the edge of each wall for creaking floors or stairs. Worn floor boards generally have more support near walls.

, Your footwork is just as important as crouching into the steps to absorb the movement. Normal heel-to-toe rolling movement is great for fast speed movement on grass and very slow movement on hard surfaces. Keep in mind that the slower you move, the more silent you are.


When moving through leaves, or trying to remain absolutely silent, keep your weight on your back foot, extend your leading foot, and to set it down and slowly shift forward, absorbing the movement in your knees and ankles. You should only have the ball of your foot, which will work as a cushion, make contact with the ground during this type of movement.
If you're maneuvering in an environment that provides ""Noise Cover"" or if there is a medium risk of being heard, lower your heel to the ground to touch when switching weight to the lead foot.
To stay silent indoors, breathe and walk to the rhythm of the room clock. If someone is asleep, they are used to the sound of the clock, and thus it will help obscure your footfalls.
Use the flat foot when walking across gravel or across anything in which many small objects can be disturbed and make noise. Absorb the step as you normally would, but you let your entire foot make contact with the gravel at the same time to let the weight distribute evenly. Slow to very slow movement should be used.

, When walking through a doorway normally (shoulders very close to the door jams) can cause sounds (like running air conditioners) to fluctuate and let people know that there's something there. The same thing applies when you are sneaking around, you can ""hear"" where people are based on how ambient noise is being manipulated. Sneak through doorways with your back to the jam, and be perpendicular to the door. This will minimize the effect.

, Try as hard as you can to not sneeze! If you have allergies, take your meds BEFORE you leave for your excursion. But be sure it won't make you drowsy! If you do feel a sneeze coming on, plug your nose, squeeze your eyes shut, and think as hard as you can about NOT sneezing. Also, for some people, saying the word ""watermelon"" repeatedly will help suppress a sneeze. Look at the article How to Stop a Sneeze for other tips.

, Being silent and undetectable means being slow and careful. If you have a creaky bed, move slowly with patience; what's five minutes of slow, steady, moving compared to the whole night off?

, Find a spot to stay motionless to give your eyes time to become accustomed to the dark before you attempt to move around too much. This will give you an advantage over anyone who is looking for you and allow you to avoid injury. You can also create an eye patch, and leave it on one eye prior to leaving, to adjust that eye to the dark, and then switch the eyepatch eye once you have entered the dark region. The human eye takes 30 minutes to fully adjust to night vision, and one flash of light can require another 30 minutes of time to adjust.

, Stay out of light as much as possible but know how to work with light when it's around. This will help you stay undetected, especially since people will be assuming that they can see everything because light is available. Absolutely avoid using your own light sources, such as a flashlight or a candle, unless you know you are in an area where no one can see you.


Standing in the darkness behind a light source (like a fire or floodlight) is a good way to hide, because the person's eyes will be adjusted to see the light, but not the darkness behind it.
The eye is extra sensitive at nighttime, so make sure that when you move around in the dark, don't make sudden or abrupt movements.

, Keep your ears perked up; if there is someone upstairs and you hear moving or the floor creaking -- hide! Always have a place pre-picked according to your position.

, Remain in a crouched position as you're moving, and have your hands out to the sides at waist level to detect any obstacles you might have not seen and keep balance, and to absorb the step when you move forward by crouching a little further down into the step. You do not want to crouch below a 90 degree angle at any moment unless you are crouching to the ground to put a knee down or lying down, because it is very hard on the knees.

, One of your worst enemies is the surprise factor. Being caught off-guard can not only startle you, but cause you to make noise or lose control of the situation. The best way to know if someone is coming is to see them; if you can't see them, hearing them is the second best way to know in advance. Most people do not walk quietly, so you can hear them coming. When in sight range of someone you may be able to wait for an opportunity to hide better if you have not.


Always act as if someone is actively looking for you, even if they aren't. This will subconsciously force you to be more careful.

, Slow movement is possible when you are in someone's sight range. If you are a decent distance away from them and they probably won't see it, lie down if your environment permits it. This minimizes your size and makes you harder to spot. Good places to go prone are dark areas or areas with foliage cover.


If you are wearing camouflage or a dark colour, this will help conceal you in the darkness. Just slip into a shadow and breathe softly.
Once they come in audible range of you, movement should not continue, and you must maintain absolute stillness.
If you are within arm's reach of the person walking towards you, freeze. If you aren't perfectly hidden, holding still will normally take care of the dilemma, but if you can manage, curl up into a ball and try to cover your shoulder features and your head; this will hide the human outline.

, Learning to make animal sounds will make people less suspicious if they hear you but will not always work. If you plan to use an animal sound, be sure it fits the environment--i.e. don't use a turkey call in Alaska or a robin call in the Caribbean. Also, be sure you can use the sound well--nothing is worse than you losing your cover when your target hears a duck call that sounds like an old-fashioned car horn. Also, if you have one, use a recorder to use different sounds to be more realistic and convincing. Make sure that the sound is the only thing recorded and not something like lake water crashing or children playing in the background.

, When sneaking, you might encounter people. Waiting until they pass might not be an option: you might have to find ways to manipulate them and work around them. This means learning how to read their behavior and predict what they will do.


Monitor a sleeping person's breathing: Regular breathing means that the person is awake or is nearly awake! Shallow breathing means that person is lightly sleeping but you should still be careful! Snoring means deeper sleep but you should still take precautions.
Distract them if you need to get past. For example, if someone is looking a way you don't want them to, then roll or throw a small object (like a coin) to create a noise in another area and make your move. Don't use a distraction if they are suspecting somebody is near.
If you are getting something from a container right by someone, take the container as far away from them as possible, open it slowly, and take what you need carefully. If it snaps shut, close it under a blanket or pillow, then return it to its original location.
When sneaking up on someone, try to match your steps with theirs and avoid breathing heavily. Also, if your target is talking with a friend next to them, be sure to be on the opposite side, for the target might look at the friend and see you. For example, if your target is on the left and friend on the right, stay slightly to the left.

, Normally when you are escaping, you have been discovered, and are making a mad dash to hide or get away. Disregard all stealth and just put distance between you and your discoverer so that you can hide once again and sneak away. If you don't think that you have been seen, you might want to try sneaking away as stealthily as possible. Then you can hide, wait for the threat to leave, and continue on doing whatever you were doing.

, You might get caught, but if you're careful you can get rid of any suspicion about what you were doing. Have a good excuse ready that is plausible and comfortable for the other person to accept.


If you hear someone coming and you are caught and inside the house, make a sleepy face and yawn then say, ""I just came out to get a glass of water."" This usually works, but don't do it a lot because people will get suspicious.
If you're sneaking into a friends room and you accidentally go in through the wrong window and end up in their dad/mom's room (or worse get the wrong house) have a code name ready for you and your friend. For example if you get the wrong house and the owner wakes up or moves like they woke up you can shout: ""Crap, Mitch! This isn't Fred's house!"" And bolt. So the owners think that you were trying to prank a friend and don't know your identity. Do the same thing ( yes even saying: this isn't ________house! ) for the wrong room.

, If you are going into an area you are not 100% secure with, ask around a bit, and if you just don't feel comfortable, plan around it. If you do not feel safe going into an area you should not enter it. Bringing something to defend yourself can greatly increase the amount of trouble that will result from being caught. In particular concealed weapons will result in the harshest punishments. It is important to remember that this is all for fun and if you are sufficiently afraid that you need a weapon you should be doing something else or sneaking somewhere else.

Observe the target closely.",How to Spy," This is called an “objective.” It’s easy to get lost in the huge amount of information you’re about to uncover. Make sure you’re trying to figure out a clear question like “Where did my sister hide my stuffed animal?” “Is my boyfriend cheating on me?” or “Why is my friend always in a hurry after gym class?”;
, The more familiar with the area you will be spying at, the more it can help you. Knowing where you will be spying will make you more comfortable when it comes time to spy.


The bigger the location where you’ll be spying, the bigger the possibility that you may lose track of your target.Try to spy where there aren't many places you can lose your target. It could take more time to scout larger locations like malls, so stick with small locations.
If you’re spying on someone you know, you may already know a lot about where the person lives or hangs out.
Notice exits, entrances, and hallways just in case of an emergency.
Figure out things you can hide behind, like large trash cans, houses, or cars.

, Write down your goal and whatever you already know about your target.


Include where you’ll be spying and your observations about the location.
Write down what you think the outcome of spying will be; when your mission is complete, you can see if you were right.
Write down dates and times of events, too. The more organized you are, the easier it is to draw conclusions.

, Figure out what the person’s schedule is and where the target will be at certain times. This will help you figure out where and when to complete your mission.


Find out the target’s name, occupation, and what area the person lives in.
Be sure you know what the target looks like. This will make following someone from a distance easier.
If you’re spying on someone you already know, find out even more personal details.

, There are endless spy gadgets on the market: a simple Google search reveals thousands! Making yourself a budget before you start looking at gadgets will mean you don’t bankrupt yourself to spy.


Only get what’s useful. For example, if you’re going to be far away from the target, binoculars could help. If you need to talk to someone on the phone, consider a voice changer.
Expensive gear usually isn’t necessary.
Simpler is better. Tons of gear can get confusing, and carrying around a bunch of gadgets looks suspicious.

, When you’re spying, however, the trick is to blend in so no one notices you. A bad spy hides; a good spy blends.

, If you’ll be spying at the beach, don’t show up wearing cameo pants and boots. Dress the way everyone else would. If the people around you are wearing a suit and tie, you do the same.

, This includes grays, blacks, and browns. Stay away from wearing distracting colors like red, orange, and yellow., Keep a relaxed posture and don’t fidget too much when you’re spying.Touching your face a lot, rubbing your legs in an anxious way, or even avoiding eye contact are all examples of nervous body language., If you are spying on someone you know personally, that means your cover can be easily blown. There are many affordable and simple ways to change the way you look.


Fake facial hair and wigs can be found at any joke shop or even in discount stores. These may look suspicious, however, if you aren’t old enough to grow facial hair, so try them on beforehand.
Sunglasses are an easy way to hide your face.
Hats hide also your face. If you have long hair, try hiding your hair in the hat, too. Wigs are another good option.
If you talk to someone, use a fake accent, but make sure that it actually sounds similar to the real one; some fake accents sound completely fake and could get your cover blown.

,


Use a soft eyebrow pencil that is darker than your skin tone.
Follow your laugh and smile lines gently with the pencil, then smooth the lines out with your finger. Do the same with the lines that run from your nostrils to the corners of your mouth, and add some wrinkles on your forehead.
Don’t make the lines too dark.

, A towel rolled up under your jacket will make to look broader. No one is likely to recognize you if your body looks completely different.

, If you know your target, changing the way you walk will prevent your target from recognizing you at a distance.

,


Often, people make personal posts on these sites that will allow you to learn a lot of information.
Making a fake social media account to follow or friend the target can be a good idea.
Take your time. Since people often make more than one post a day, going through someone’s social media accounts can be time consuming.
Write down any posts that are relevant to your objective.

, Camera lenses can zoom in on a subject, so you can take pictures from far away. This can help you more easily remember what you observed while following someone. Be sneaky because someone can easily see you taking a picture.

, This can be difficult, and it may get your cover blown, so be casual. If you have a question you need answered, people who are good friends with the target could have important clues.


Don’t try this unless you really believe the target’s friends could have clues that help your objective.
Never ask the target’s friends directly about your mission. Bring your question up in a natural way.
The closer you already are to the target’s friends, the easier this will be. Trying to interview a stranger isn’t a good idea, and it could be dangerous.

, If there is an item you need to obtain in order to gain information, take it, but leave as little a trace as possible.


If you see that the target leaves the room or office, slip in casually and shut the door behind before taking anything.
Make sure no one sees you do take anything.
Be sure not to move anything around. Leave everything as it was when you stepped in. Make a mental note of what it looked like before you touch anything.
Remember that stealing is illegal. If you need to get an item from someone, put it back once you look at it.

, Keep your objective in mind the entire time you’re spying. A clue is anything that could answer your objective.


Try to read lips and understand conversation without hearing it being spoken.
Have more than one back up plan, just in case you need to leave a situation with short notice.
Don’t wear yourself out. If you’ve been spying for hours, take a break. The more tired you are, the less observant you will be.

The only case in which going out the front door is acceptable is if your sibling (who is willing to cover/help you) is coming in and you go out at the same time.;
, Although you can sneak out when your parent(s) are awake, it's much riskier. I mean, what if they go into your room to say goodnight or something like that? The only case that is much less risky for this is if you AND FRIENDS are downstairs and you simply leave while your parent(s) are in bed but not necessarily asleep. Your best bet is to wait an hour AT THE LEAST after they've fallen asleep, but any more is perfectly fine and much safer. Do NOT ever ask when they are going to go to bed; that will just arouse suspicion. Also, don't go to bed too early because a) it will also arouse suspicion and b) it's very hard to stay awake when you're lying in bed in the dark. A tip that's very helpful is if you go into your parent(s) room to say goodnight and casually close the door on your way out. It makes sneaking past their room much easier and it's much less stressful for you.

, You must be prepared to sneak out, even if it's on the fly. For instance, are all the alarms off? The door from which you're leaving unlocked? Are the trouble spots smoothed over? Is your route secure and safe? Also, make sure that you get ready quietly. For girls this is more important; if you weren't wearing makeup before you went to bed you have to put it on quietly and carefully. Make sure you know what you're wearing and where it is. Your phone should be on silent, NOT on vibrate, and it's always safe to turn it off until you're out of your house.

, Do NOT wear shoes when you're going past your parents; in fact, don't put shoes on until you are two houses away from your own house. A technique that works for me is the fake pee. When you're all ready to go, simply come out of your room and go to the bathroom. You don't actually have to pee, but flush the toilet after about 30-45 seconds and then run the water for about 10-20 seconds. Come out of the bathroom, go back to your room, but don't go back inside. Instead, open the door and then close it after about 2-5 seconds. Now is where your ninja skills come in. Tiptoe slowly and carefully past your parents, and freeze whenever you make a sound, like when a floorboard creaks or something. Also freeze when you HEAR a sound, especially from your parents' room. Once your past your parents but not out of your house, you can loosen up a little bit, but still tiptoe like a ninja and be as quiet as you can. When you go out your designated door, do NOT close it completely, but don't leave it wide open. Leave it so that the door is touching the door frame, but it's not closed. It'll make it so much easier to come back in.

, The fake pee can also be used in this case. Using your ninja skills, sneak back past your parents and open and close your door again, but DON'T go inside. Go to the bathroom and flush the toilet, run the water, etc. But this time when you go back to your room, actually go inside. This method is nearly fail safe.

If you're dressed up a ridiculous disguise, act super nervous, or make it really obvious that you're trying to spy by tripping, carrying colorful equipment, or generally drawing attention to yourself, then you'll be caught within seconds. If you want to spy on people, you have to know how to act cool, like you're just minding your own business — instead of devising a scheme to find out what people are really up to.


Part of acting casual comes from your body language. Don't stand up too tall but hunch over just enough to look relaxed, don't fidget too much, and keep your eyes looking ahead instead of looking down at the floor. If you come off as too nervous, people will instantly notice you.
Don't act like you're loitering around, looking up and down, or searching for something. This will make it pretty obvious what you're there for. Just act cool, like you're taking your time waiting for someone, enjoying a spring day, or just wrapped up in your own thoughts.
If the person you're spying on sees you, act like it's no big deal. Say hi or just nod and smile if you don't know the person. If you run off or look jittery, that will definitely clue the person in on the fact that something is up.;
, This is an important part of being a master spy. Though if you're good at what you do, you'll never get caught, you have to be prepared for whatever may come your way, and unfortunately, one of those things is being found out. So, before you go on your next spy mission, you have to come up with a likely story for why you're spying, or you'll be caught red-handed. Here are some ideas:


If you're at home spying on a parent or sibling, come up with an idea for why you're in that closet, at the edge of that doorway, or creeping up in the same room as the person. Maybe you're crouched down on the floor because you've lost an earring (bonus points if you're wearing just one earring), or because you're searching for something else. Maybe you're in the basement because you're folding your laundry. Find a reason for whatever it is you're doing and why you're there.
If you're out in public spying on someone, just come up with a reason for being in the same place. If the person catches you spying on him at Macy's, mention that you're there to pick up a Mother's Day gift for your mom. If you're caught spying at the movies, produce two tickets and say you're waiting for a friend who never showed up. The more normal and boring your excuse is, the better.

, This is another must for a true spy. If you're going to spy on someone, then you can't go clomping around in work boots or high heels. Pick shoes that have rubber soles and are light and quiet, such as TOMS, light sandals, or even Ugg boots, which tend not to make a sound. Test the shoes out before you use them for a spy mission. If you're at home, of course, then bare feet should work best.


Beyond the shoes, you also have to practice not making a lot of sound when you walk. Tread lightly, walking on your toes, trying to make as little noise as possible.

, You can learn a lot from reading books or watching movies about people who are professional spies, or who involve some spying into their everyday lives. You can get some great ideas about which techniques work best and which should be avoided. Here are some great sources of inspiration:


Harriet the Spy
Nancy Drew
The Hardy Boys
Any James Bond films
The Bourne Trilogy
Alias
Rear Window
Disturbia

, Once you have a target in mind and a spy plan on your docket, it's best to get some practice before you do the real thing. You can practice spying on one of your friends instead of your target to see if you'll get caught. You can spy on your mom instead of your sister for a bit just to see if it'll work. If you get caught, you can ask yourself what you can do better to avoid getting caught the next time.


It's important to know your strengths and weaknesses as a spy, and to adjust your first mission accordingly based on what you learned from your practice session.

, The key to being a spy is to blend into to your surroundings as much as you can. This doesn't mean you should camouflage yourself like Peeta in The Hunger Games, but that you should make sure you're as inconspicuous as possible in any setting. Don't do anything that will set you apart from other people. If you're at a football game, wear fan gear like everyone else — you'll stand out much more if you're wearing black. Pick clothes that make you fit in to the environment, instead of investing in fancy spy gear that puts a big bullseye on your back.


It's important to not only look like everyone else around you, but to do what everyone else is doing. If you're in a bookstore, act like you're searching for a book or engrossed in one. If you're at an ice cream shop, you'll look pretty weird if you're enjoying your own cone of ice cream.
If you're spying from home, then wear what you normally wear so your family members or neighbors don't suspect that something is different about you. If you can minimize the sound your clothes make, that would be helpful, but beyond that, don't mix it up too much.

, Harriet the Spy knew what she was doing. If you really want to be able to spy on people and to discover all of the secrets of the loved ones and strangers around you, then carrying a notebook around is an absolute must. You should notice everything you hear and see and jot it down. It may not make much sense to you or seem too important yet, but later, you may realize that you were on your way to finding a huge piece of the puzzle.


Write down the date and time, and jot down everything the person is doing.
To make the notebook look uninteresting, write ""MATH"" or the name of another school subject on it in big letters. Who would want to open that?
Disguise your handwriting as much as you can. If someone finds your notebook, you want to make sure they can't trace it back to you. Write in tiny letters if you normally write with large letters, make your writing slanted in a different direction, dot your i's if you don't normally do that, and so on.
Don't refer to the person you're spying on by his or her real name. Use a code name.
You can carry a small pocket-sized pad if you think it'll make you look too obvious.

, Though you can definitely spy on people on your own, having a partner can help you get some important information you might not have discovered by yourself. Your partner can help you try new techniques, can be useful if you have a walkie-talkie thing going, and can be a huge help if the person you're spying on knows you but has never seen your partner before. The most important thing, though, is that your partner is someone you can really trust. You don't want someone else blowing your cover.


Having a partner can help you up your game because the person can pose as a door-to-door salesman, lost citizen, or another random person who can get the person's attention while you continue your sleuthing.

, Standing pressed flat to a wall when something around the corner is happening is one great way to spy on people in your home. Make sure that you press yourself to the wall, leave at least an inch or two between you and the corner so you stay hidden, and that you carefully turn one ear toward the source. You can also crouch by the corner and listen this way, but this will make it a bit harder to come up with an excuse if you're caught.


If you hear the person approaching, just casually walk up the stairs to cross their path with an idea of what you're setting out to do. It's better to do this than to have the person see you scurrying down the stairs.

, This is another great way to spy on someone in your house. You can be in the next room, overhearing everything the person said, while listening to all of the juicy gossip they are talking about. If you want to spy on your sister in the basement, go to the room next to it to fold your laundry; if you want to spy on your dad, who is fixing up the garage, act like you're raking leaves outside. Of course, the quieter the activity you're doing nearby, the better.


Don't do something completely out of the ordinary that you would never normally do —like suddenly doing the dishes when you haven't done them for months —or that will arouse even more suspicion.

, If you're a kid, then your parents are probably used to you going around with your headphones in, rocking out to music all the time. If this is what you do —or if you want to get into the habit of doing this around the house so people think it's normal for you —then it can be a great way to have people reveal private information in the same room as you because they don't think you're listening.


Though this may not always work, if you always putter around the house with your headphones in, laughing to yourself, and looking like you're in your own world, people will get into the habit of thinking that you're not really there, and they may inadvertently say something around you because they think you're not listening.
You should still have some music playing, such as classical music or jazz, just in case you're caught out. Just play it at a low volume.

, Listening in on the other line while your parents or siblings are talking on the house phone is another great way to spy. The important thing here is to anticipate the conversation before it happens, so you've already picked up the phone when the person sets out to make the call. If you pick up the phone after the person does, then they'll be able to hear you before they make the call.


If the phone rings for your mom or sibling and you want to stay on the line, then pick it up first, yell for the person to get it, and once they do, place the phone down and pick it back up, so it looks like you've put down the receiver.
It's particularly important to avoid breathing heavily when you spy over the phone. You can even hold the phone close to your ear but a bit away from your mouth to minimize suspicion.

, If you want to be able to spy on people at home, then you have to practice breathing as shallowly as possible. If you breathe too heavily, then your sibling or family member will instantly turn around and you'll be caught. You need to practice taking slow, shallow breaths, out of your nose if possible, so that your breathing doesn't catch anyone's attention.


You should also work on learning to hold a sneeze or to suppress a cough. You don't want your allergies to give you away, either.

, A web camera with motion detection can be a huge asset to a spy's computer. If you set it to turn on whenever anyone walks in the room, then it'll automatically start recording the person who is in there, and you'll be able to see exactly what that person has been up to. This is a great way to spy on people in your house. If you have a laptop, you can even leave it in different parts of your house ""by accident"" so you're more likely to be able to record people.

, If you place a glass to the wall with the bottom facing your ear and the open part of the glass to the wall, you'll be able to slightly amplify the sound in the next room. This can help you be a master eavesdropper, and to hear everything the people in the next room are saying — whether or not they want to keep things secret.

, If you're out in public to spy on someone, the best thing you can do is to blend in completely. If the person knows you and you want to stay hidden, then you can consider wearing sunglasses, but only if it doesn't make you look totally obvious. To fit in with the crowd, just wear whatever the people are wearing and do what the people are doing. You can also change your hairstyle or do something different to make yourself look different, as long as it doesn't draw more attention to you.


Putting on a fake elaborate beard or dressing in all black in the middle of the summer, for example, will only make you stand out more.

, Move quickly enough so that it looks like you're walking with purpose, but slowly enough that it doesn't seem like you're in a particular rush. If you're trailing someone, you must never run, obviously pick up the pace, or get out of breath. If you really want to go undetected, then you have to be stealthy and keep your cool, even if your target is getting away.


Though the most important thing is to keep an eye on your target, you should also be aware of your surroundings. You'll blow your cover if you bump into someone, knock something over, or trip.

, Learning to read lips is a skill that can help you go far. If you learn to do this, you can watch people from afar and figure out what they're talking about. Of course, you have to have to be able to see the person's mouth and to remain unseen, but you can pull this off if you remain inconspicuous — or find a great hiding place with a pair of binoculars! You can take lip-reading courses online to learn how to master this useful and stealthy skill. For example, here are a few things you should know:When a person says vowels, his mouth will make a ""round-mouthed"" shape.
When a person says the ""th"" sound, the tongue will come out of his house and his lips will be rounded.
You can try sounding out the word in your own mouth to get a better sense of what might have been said.
Once you get better at looking at the mouth and lips, you can start to look at the rest of the mouth and face for context.
Until you become a master at lip reading, you can even try to videotape a person's conversation (if you can see his face) and then play it back later for yourself as you try to decipher what the person was saying.

, Binoculars are another must to have if you're committed to really spying on people. The important thing is that you use them wisely and very, very carefully. You can use them from home to spy on your neighbors -- if you're in a dark room with no reflection, it may be harder to get noticed than if you're out in public.


Though you may see lots of films of people using binoculars while crouching in a bush, in reality, this will get you caught pretty fast. If you really want to use binoculars to spy on people outside, then you should make sure you have lots of distance from the person you're spying on.

, If you're going out in public, then you don't want to bring a camera, a giant backpack, eighty spy gadgets, and a giant notebook and set of pens. You should only bring what you absolutely need to spy on someone — and look like you're carrying even less. If you bring lots of gear and need a while to set everything up, then you'll only draw more attention to yourself. Find a way to pack everything you need in a small bag or to hide it in your coat. If you look like you're carrying almost nothing, then people will think you're up to nothing.

, If you're out in public and want to spy on the person behind you, pull out a mirror, and maybe even some makeup, and make it look like you're just studying your face. Then, tilt the mirror in such a direction that you can see the person you want to see behind you in the mirror. You can also try to hide the mirror in a book or another object you're holding in front of you — just make sure no one can spot it.


If you're going to make it look like you're just grooming yourself, you can't do this forever. If you do it for too long, you may call too much attention to yourself.

, You can go online and find covert objects that are really recording devices, such as the Spy Pen. If you get one of these objects, you can leave it where two people will sit down and talk, leave it on, and then come back for it later so you can play the conversation back to yourself. You can also just use a regular recorder, but then you have to be able to hide it well — maybe in the bottom of a bag you accidentally ""left"" in the place where the people you're spying on will be.


If you're using a traditional recorder with a tape, just remember that it will eventually run out of tape and will make a tell-tale sound when it does so. Use it to record for only a short period of time.

, If you're a true spy, then you have to make sure people can't figure out who you are or learn anything about you. Lock your phone, computer, or any of your other devices, so that if you accidentally leave them out, people cannot access them. You may even be able to set them so that an alarm goes off if someone other than you touches them. This can help you know who is trying to spy on you — and it will keep all of your secrets safe.

However, this won’t work if your neighbor is a couple houses down or across the neighborhood. In these cases, perhaps you can park your car on the street near their house, or even find a comfortable bush to hide in. Creativity is the mark of a great spy.;
, This can include binoculars, a telescope, or even night-vision goggles if you have the cash to invest in them. A camera is useful for documenting anything suspicious you might see, and a voice recorder can be used to save conversations of importance.


Your spy equipment is your most important asset, but it can also turn into your most incriminating if you aren't careful. Make sure you understand when it is and isn't appropriate and legal to record or photograph your neighbors.
The general rule of thumb is that people in public places don't have to give their consent to be recorded. When your neighbors are in private places, such as their homes, they can still be recorded if they are in public view (i.e. in front of big windows or on their sidewalks).Use your common sense while spying. Watching them play Scrabble in their living room is one thing, peering through closed blinds into their bedroom is another. It is possible to be a successful spy without breaking any laws or totally violating someone's right to privacy.

, To be a great spy, you must be patient. Whether you are camping out in your living room or your car to watch your neighbor, you need to make sure that your home base is somewhere you can spend a great deal of time. You may be staked out for days, weeks, or even months getting the information you need.


Make sure you have coffee or energy drinks in your base. You need to be alert at all hours of the day or night, so caffeine will become your best friend.Keep snacks handy as well, because you don't want to miss seeing something important because you made a dash to McDonald's.
Dress comfortably and appropriately. If you are staking out outside, make sure you dress for the elements. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes that you can move around in, so that you're prepared to face anything.

, Remember that if you can see your neighbor, they can probably see you. You don’t want your base to catch their eye by appearing out of the ordinary. Make sure that to anyone who looks in, your set-up looks no different than a bedroom, living room, or home office.


It is a good idea to keep a television, books, a computer, or some other form of entertainment in your spy base. If neighbors see you spending hours upon hours in the same spot, they will wonder why. If you're sitting silently in a utility closet staring out the window, people may become suspicious. However, people won't give you a second glance if it looks like you're reading or working on a laptop.
Keep binoculars, telescopes, and other spy devices out of sight. People may have no idea what you’re using them for, but they could still raise suspicions. You don’t want your neighbor to become guarded, because it will only make your job more difficult.
If your vehicle is your base, make sure that you always keep equipment concealed in the glove compartment or a carrying case. Not only will exposed spy equipment be a red flag for passersby, but it can also make your car a target for a break-in.

, This will allow you to observe your neighbor without trespassing onto their private property. The best place to do this is from a window in your home or car. Keep your lights off so the neighbors cannot see you observing them. You can watch them through windows or as they go about their day-to-day activities outside their home.

, Things will get very awkward very fast if your neighbor notices that you’ve been spying. Avoid the big fake mustaches and costume glasses, and instead go for a subtle disguise. Wigs, hats, and baggy clothing can all be used to effectively conceal your identity. Don’t forget to dress appropriately for your surroundings, however. If you stick out like a sore thumb, you will surely be noticed by your neighbor.This is especially important if you are watching from outside your home, such as on the street, in public places, or from your car.
Change up your disguise regularly. Your neighbor will become suspicious if they see the same person everywhere they go.

, Even if something seems mundane, jot it down, take a picture, record it, etc. Note the date and time on all the pieces of evidence you record. Every piece of information you gather can come together to form the bigger picture, so don’t underestimate the importance of little details.


Remember to be careful that you're not doing anything illegal when you take pictures. You can get in serious trouble if your neighbor had every reason to expect privacy, such as when they are in a bathroom or bedroom with blinds drawn.Don’t forget to turn your flash off when you take pictures. It won’t be very sneaky if you are blinding them with light.

, This sounds disgusting, and it is. However, you can learn a lot about your neighbor by seeing what they are throwing away. Get gloves, and get your hands dirty. Wait until it's dark and go rummage through their trash bins or even take the entire bag.


Don't go through their garbage while it is on their property, because you can get in trouble for trespassing. Wait until they've put their garbage out on the curb for collection. When their trash is on the street, they've forfeited their privacy rights and you can rummage through it legally.While it may be legal, it still may appear creepy and invasive. If you want to be sneaky, wait until the area is deserted or dark.
You can find valuable information about your neighbor from receipts and bills. This can give you information about where they go, where they shop, etc.

, This is where note-taking really comes in handy. Do they leave their house every day at the same time in workout clothes? Does the same visitor come over weekly at the same time? By noting patterns, you can piece together their day-to-day lives and get a better idea of who exactly you are spying on.


By having a clear idea of their typical schedule, you'll be more likely to notice when something is out of the ordinary.
Knowing their schedule is also important so you know when to be tuned in and watching the home, or when you can take a quick rest. As a spy, it is important to get rest when you know you won't miss anything major.

, Add them on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or whatever other social medias they may have. They will most likely accept your online advances because you’re neighbors, after all. The things that your neighbor posts on social media will give you huge insight into their lives.Don't be overeager and add them on every social media platform within five minutes. If they feel creeped out, they're not likely to accept your requests.

, Keep your friends close, your enemies closer, and the people you’re spying on even closer than that. Sure, it looks pretty cool to dress in all black and watch them under the cover of darkness, but you can get more information by spending time with them. As people let their guards down, they’ll share more and more. This also eliminates the risk of being seen as the paranoid, nosy neighbor.


Host a cookout or a game night with multiple neighbors, so that the particular neighbors in question don't feel like they are being singled out.
Alcohol can be a truth serum, so let it flow! If you are trying to get information out of your neighbor, offer them a beer or three."
"
Rotate your joints, such as knees, hips, and ankles.,
Warming up an essential for this.,
Your footwork is just as important as crouching into the steps to absorb the movement.",How to Sneak Around in the Day or Night1," Your ankles are especially important as they tend to ""pop"" often.

, If you are not warmed up, you can get hurt more easily and you make more noise.

, Normal heel-to-toe rolling movement is great for fast speed movement on grass and very slow movement on hard surfaces. Keep in mind that the slower you move, the more silent you are. When moving through leaves, or trying to remain absolutely silent, keep your weight on your back foot, extend your leading foot, and to set it down and slowly shift forward, absorbing the movement in your knees and ankles. You should only have the ball of your foot, which will work as a cushion, make contact with the ground during this type of movement.


If you're maneuvering in an environment that provides ""noise cover"" or if there is a medium risk of being heard, lower your heel to the ground to touch when switching weight to the lead foot. To stay silent indoors, breathe and walk to the rhythm of the room clock. If someone is asleep, they are used to the sound of the clock, and thus it will help obscure your footfalls. Use the flat foot when walking across gravel or across anything in which many small objects can be disturbed and make noise. Absorb the step as you normally would, but you let your entire foot make contact with the gravel at the same time to let the weight distribute evenly. Move slowly.

Avoid wearing any chains, necklaces, bracelets, and anything else hanging. Wear only clothes!
If you can, try to get a ghillie suit if you are in a high grass or forested area so that you can hide.;
, Wear dark brown and green colors when outside. When inside, stick to dark places and wear grayish-coloured clothes.


Try to wear clothing that conceals all of your skin, as skin shows up when a light is shone upon it.

, Always act as if someone is looking for you at every moment. Never relax and be ready to freeze at a nanosecond's notice.

, Don't try to dart into another hiding spot when you know that your target is right outside the room. Don't make noises to annoy your target. Keep it stealthy and quiet.

, Make sure no one is following you and that no one is around. If you hear someone's footsteps, then immediately find a hiding place. Your hiding place shouldn't be somewhere where you will be found easily, such as your bathroom or closet.

, People usually look right, left, and back, but not up or down. Hiding under the bed is just as good a hiding place as the top shelf of a closet.

,


Walk next to the wall where the floor is less likely to squeak.
Avoid the wall opposite the door in every room so that a glance into the room won't spot you. If someone comes walking toward you, freeze and don't move for a while, and you probably won't be spotted.
Be aware of the background when outside. Avoid sky or grass and stick around mixed shadow and light, buildings, and trees. Stay low as much as possible and avoid wide open spaces. If you have to get to the other side, and there is no coverage straight across, go around and make big circular detours.
Inside your house, know where everything is. Know where the floorboard squeaks are and map them. Know which doors never get closed and slip behind them for a quick and temporary hiding spot. Know the best hiding spot in every room and all possible escape routes.

, When sneaking, every movement counts, and it's important to be as graceful as a cat, as quiet as a mouse and as light as a bird. Move slowly and carefully most of the time. Sometimes, though, you'll need to move swiftly, to get to where you need to be without notice. Move quickly when in the open and rest in complete silence when safe.


Use the balls of your feet whenever you walk, run, or jump. This will help silence your feet. It is best to go barefoot, but if you need shoes on, then carefully and slowly walk in shoes that don't make a lot of noise.
Support your weight on the handrail when walking up or down the stairs. If you are walking on a squeaky floor, grab furniture or handrails to support yourself, as it helps you to make less noise.

, Laying flat on your stomach helps when hiding behind small things. If you need to look around something, use one eye so your whole head does not show. If you have long hair, put it up so when hiding it does not show and get you discovered. Never allow your form to be shown against the horizon.

, As soon as you enter a room, start looking for places to hide. You could squeeze in between a dresser and the wall. You could hide under a rumpled bedspread. If you're in the bathroom, you could get behind the shower curtain and pull it out just enough to hide you so it wouldn't look suspicious. Just look around for more clever hiding places.


At night, use shadows to your advantage.

, If you move anything, put it back in place. Someone very observant would be able to tell that an item was moved into a different position. It is best to assume that there is such a person if you're dealing with a group of people.

, Move when something is making noise. When the coffee grinder is going, the TV volume is up, or a car is passing, that is your time to move. Do not do it otherwise unless you really have to. It's risky.


A good time to move is when there's background noise. If some people are talking, then that's an excellent time to move because they would probably be paying close attention to the conversation, not so much for things around them (like you sneaking around).
If someone hears a noise they will wait to hear another sound. If you don't move for a while, they may think they were hearing things and will probably forget about it.

, If you think that someone is going to find you (if you're hiding from someone), carry a small object that you can throw a fair distance away, to create a distraction that will allow you to change your hiding place.


An alternative to this: Set up a noise maker in a nearby room. Try taking a clear string and tying it to something in the closet. Make sure it is a long string. After you have secured the knot, close the closet door as far as it can go. Get into position in your hiding place. Make sure you have a firm grip on the string. If your target is about to find you, give the string a quick but strong jerk. Whatever it was tied to should topple over, making a loud noise. Your target will run to the noise, and then, seeing no one is there, will probably get discouraged and leave the room. Just make sure your target doesn't see the string!

, For instance, if you are caught, you could say you are playing hide-and-seek, you're there to do repairs, or you're looking for someone/a particular house number.

Pick someone who will not be playing.,
Pick a murderer.,
Begin the game.,
Scratch the inside of other players’ wrists.,
Wait ten seconds before “dying.” As a player, if the inside of your wrist is scratched, you must wait ten seconds before you officially “die.” This helps add to the mystery of who the killer is, as you will likely have shaken someone else’s hand right after the murderer’s.,
Try to guess who the murderer is.",How to Play Murder1," If no one volunteers, try playing rock, paper, scissors or drawing straws. Then you can take turns with who sits out if you play multiple games. This person will either control the light switch of the room or hold a flashlight. They can pause the game at any time, and ask someone if they know who the murderer is. They will also turn the lights off at the beginning of the game.;
, You can do this a few different ways. Either the person who is not playing can choose a murderer or you can randomly choose one using a deck of cards or pieces of paper. For example, have everyone stand in a circle and close their eyes. The person sitting out can then tap someone on the shoulder and that person will be the murderer.


To use a deck of cards, use all non-face cards except one. The person who draws the face card will then be the murderer.The same can be done with slips of paper. Gather as many slips as you have players and keep them all blank except one. On one piece of paper draw an X, then whoever gets this piece of paper is the murderer.

, Everyone must walk as if they are walking in a grid. This means straight lines and ninety-degree turns. There is no set pattern to follow, you just want to make sure everyone isn’t bumping into each other. However, you should be passing other players frequently. You must also shake the hand of everyone you pass.

, If you are the murderer, you want to kill as many players as you can before you get caught. The way to do this is by scratching the inside of another player’s wrist with your index finger while shaking their hand. Remember, it’s not necessary to kill every person whose hand you shake. Especially since this will make it obvious that you’re the killer.,

Feel free to be as dramatic with your death as you want. You can fling yourself to the floor, scream, fake cry - it’s up to you!

, While the game is taking place, players are free to guess who they think the murderer is. For example, someone might say “Jason, are you the murderer?” If they’re correct, then the game ends and you can start a new one. However, if they’re wrong, they “die” and have to leave the game.


Once the murderer is discovered, the game is officially over.

"
"
Choose a murderer.,
Sit in a circle and hold hands.,
Start the squeeze.,
Exit when you're the victim.,
Guess the murderer.",How to Play Murder2," You can do this in a few different ways. One way is to get a bowl or paper bag and cut/tear a piece of paper into small slips. On one piece of paper, write M for the murderer and leave the other slips blank. The player who gets the M will be the killer.


You can also use a deck of cards. For example, use non-face cards (i.e. anything that’s not a King, Queen, or Jack) and then mix one face card into them. Whoever pulls the face card will then be the murderer.

, Once the murderer has been chosen, you want to have everyone get into a circle and hold hands. This is necessary as the murderer will have to pass along a “squeeze” to kill his or her victims.]

Once you are ready to begin, make sure to have someone turn out the lights.

, Whoever the murderer is can wait as long as they want until they start the squeeze. However, they can only squeeze the hands of the people to the right and left of them. These are the people that will help pass it along until it reaches the victim. For example, let’s say the murderer squeezes the hand of the person on their right three times. The person on their right must then squeeze the hand of the person next to them two times, and so on until it reaches one squeeze. Whoever’s hand is squeezed one time must then “die.”, If your hand is only squeezed once, you are, unfortunately, “dead.” This means you have to stop playing and leave the circle. However, you can die as dramatically as you want. Often, a more dramatic death adds more fun to the game. For example, flinging yourself from your chair, clutching your chest, and moaning.

, This can be tricky as you don’t always know which direction the squeeze is coming from. However, as the circle gets smaller, you should be able to get a better idea of who the murderer is. Once you have an idea, ask “Sarah, are you the murderer?” If you’re correct, you win and the game is over. If you’re wrong, though, you have to leave the circle and the game continues.Keep playing until the murderer is uncovered or until all players are dead and the murderer wins.

Write out what happened.,
Find out why you were searched.,
Identify who searched you.,
Talk to witnesses.,
Identify how many students were searched.,
Consider your age and gender.,
Compare the scope of the search to the reason for the search.,
Refuse to consent.,
Study your school's rules and procedures.,
Talk to a trusted teacher or guidance counselor.",How to Prove Your School Violated Your Fourth Amendment Rights," If you believe you were searched in violation of your Fourth Amendment rights, the first thing you should do is record your account of the search while everything is still fresh in your mind.


Include as many factual details as possible in your account, including the date and time of the search and the names and job titles of school officials involved.
Recount where and how the search took place – these details may make a difference in whether the search was reasonable or violated your Fourth Amendment rights.
For example, if you were patted down in front of a classroom of students, a court might consider that excessively intrusive because of the embarrassment caused by you being singled out and patted down in front of your peers – even though pat-downs are generally permissible in the school setting.
On the other hand, if you were called out of class and patted down in a private location such as the principal's office, that search typically would not be considered unreasonable providing the search was justified.;
, Generally, school officials must have a reasonable suspicion that a search will uncover evidence of illegal activity. You must know why school officials searched you to analyze whether an individualized, reasonable suspicion existed.Reasonable suspicion is something less than the probable cause required for police to get a warrant to search. This lower standard may mean that anything school officials find wouldn't be admissible in court.
For example, if school officials had reasonable suspicion to believe a student had illegal drugs in her backpack, and a search revealed illegal drugs, that evidence could be used to impose school discipline on the student.
However, it couldn't necessarily be used in a court prosecution of that student, even though the drugs were a violation of the law as well as a violation of school rules.
The ""reasonable suspicion"" standard is not one that has been defined by the courts. Therefore, you must compare your school's reasons to reasons provided by other schools in court cases to determine whether the school's suspicion could be categorized as reasonable.
The Supreme Court has ruled that school searches must be justified at their inception. This means that reasonable suspicion must exist before you're searched – the school can't use the fact that they actually found something illegal when they searched to justify the search after the fact.

, The lesser standard of reasonable suspicion only applies to school officials – not to police officers, even if they are employed by your school. If a police officer conducts a search of you or your belongings, they must have a warrant.This applies to ""resource officers"" as well, even if they are not employed by the school or are considered off duty while working with the school.
If someone has a law enforcement badge, they must get a warrant based on sufficient probable cause to conduct a search of you or your belongings.
School officials have a lower standard because courts recognize that it would be impractical and potentially dangerous to require them to get a warrant. Teachers and school officials have a substantial need to maintain order and control in the school setting that requires more flexibility.
However, this lowered standard doesn't extend to police officers on school grounds.

, Get statements from anybody who was present when the search took place, or who has information regarding why the school decided to search you. These statements may assist you in proving the school violated your Fourth Amendment rights.


Witness statements can be especially useful if the school official who searched you relies on one reason to justify the search, while another teacher or administrator claims a different reason was used initially.
If school officials relied on information from a source, such as a teacher or another student, to justify the search, try to find out who the source was and talk to them as well. You need to verify what they said.
For example, suppose a fellow student told the principal that she was in the bathroom and overheard two students talking about smoking marijuana at lunch time. She didn't know who the students were, but she knew they were in her class because they were talking about the test being given that day.
If the principal used that information to justify searching all the girls in the class for marijuana, the search generally would violate those students' Fourth Amendment rights. The principal did not have an individualized reasonable suspicion that any one girl in particular had marijuana on her person.

, Generally, a school must have individualized suspicion to search you. This means school authorities cannot search everyone in a class because they heard someone had drugs – they must have a reason to suspect each individual they search.Keep in mind that this does not apply to drug-sniffing dogs, and generally does not apply to locker searches – although locker searches only involve items in plain sight, and school officials cannot open any closed bags or boxes within lockers.
The Fourth Amendment generally is designed to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy. Thus, courts have ruled that students don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their lockers, since the lockers themselves are owned and provided to them by the school.
There also is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the air surrounding your belongings, so drug-sniffing dogs can walk classrooms, hallways, or student parking lots and identify anything in ""plain smell.""
If a drug-sniffing dog alerts to a smell on your belongings or clothing, this provides school officials with the necessary individualized reasonable suspicion to justify a search.

, A school search must not be excessively intrusive in light of your age and gender. Some types of searches that would be okay for older students may be unreasonable for younger students.Keep in mind that it all goes back to your reasonable expectation of privacy, and this depends very much on who you are. For example, courts have repeatedly held that teenage girls have a higher reasonable expectation of privacy than other students.
These considerations also differ depending on the gender of the school official conducting the search. For example, it typically would be seen as unreasonable for a male teacher to conduct a pat-down search of a female high school student.
Most states have laws prohibiting strip searches of students regardless of their age or gender, but strip searches of young children in particular are never appropriate.
On the other hand, older students may have heightened expectations of privacy in their belongings relative to young children.
For example, a kindergartner who frequently has help from teachers or parents to pack his school bag each day would have a lesser expectation of privacy in that bag than a high school student would.

, For a search by school officials to be reasonable, its scope must be reasonably related to why you were searched and what school officials believed they would find.A search of greater scope might be justified if the school is looking for items such as firearms or other weapons that pose an immediate danger.
However, if the safety risk is minimal, an extensive or intrusive search typically violates the student's Fourth Amendment rights.
For example, suppose your school prohibits students from having playing cards at school. The principal has a reasonable suspicion that you brought a deck of cards with you to school. This might give her justification to search your locker or your backpack – however, a strip search to locate a deck of cards typically would be considered far outside the realm of reasonableness.
Many states have outlawed strip searches of students in school at any time and for any reason. Prohibited strip searches don't necessarily have to involve full nudity. The definition typically includes searches in which the student is asked to remove all clothing but remains in his or her undergarments.

, School authorities must have reasonable suspicion to search you. However, if you consent to the search, they don't even need that. Your consent means they can search you for no reason at all, so when in doubt, don't consent to the search.Keep in mind that even though you may be pressured, you never have to consent to be searched. School officials may try to convince you to consent because they don't actually have an individualized reasonable suspicion that you are violating school rules.
If you consent to a search, you give up any right you may have had to challenge the search later. A search to which you consented can never violate your Fourth Amendment rights, even if you were unaware of the scope or extent of the search before you consented.

, Typically any searches will be conducted under an existing policy or procedure outlined in the school's handbook. If that policy or procedure violates students' Fourth Amendment rights, it should be changed.If you don't have a copy of the most up-to-date school handbook, ask a school administrator or guidance counselor for a copy. You also may be able to download a copy from your school's website.
Keep in mind that sometimes school handbooks aren't updated as frequently as they ought to be, and your school may have policies or procedures in place that allow searches of students that violate their Fourth Amendment rights.
Analyze the procedures and policies carefully using what you've learned about your Fourth Amendment rights in the school setting. If you find a policy or procedure that allows students' constitutional rights to be violated, make a note of it.
You also can use the information in your student handbook in the event you become the subject of a search. If school procedures have been carefully designed to protect the Fourth Amendment rights of students, your search may be unreasonable if it violates those policies or procedures.
The existence of written procedures establishes what is reasonable, and if a school official violates those procedures you may be able to argue the search was unreasonable solely on the basis that it violated established school protocol.

, If you believe your school violated your Fourth Amendment rights, you need to have an adult on your side to strengthen your voice and help you navigate the system.


It also can help to talk to your parents. You may have a lawsuit against the school, but you can't file a lawsuit as a minor without your parents' assistance.
There are many nonprofit organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union that have resources available to help students prove their school violated their Fourth Amendment rights.
If you have additional questions or concerns about your school's search procedures, or find it difficult to talk to authority figures at your school about the situation, you might want to look for a local office of one of these nonprofit organizations.
You also may be able to contact civil rights organizations by searching for them online and sending an email.
When you speak with an adult, show them the written account you made of the search to which you were subjected and any other information you have about the situation so they are better equipped to help you.

Understand the rules.,
Block your opponent.,
Hit your opponent’s blots.,
Bear off as soon as possible.",How to Win at Backgammon1," Thorough comprehension of the rules of backgammon will make it easier for you to win. If you are new to backgammon, you may benefit from making sure that you know the rules inside and out. If you have any confusion about the rules of backgammon, get answers to your questions from more experienced players.;
, Remember that blocking is a good way to prevent your opponent from advancing to the bearing off stage too soon in the game. Go on the defensive right away by getting two or more of your checkers onto some strategic points around the board. Remember, you only need two checkers on a point to make it unavailable to your opponent.Having two or more checkers on points will also prevent your opponent from hitting your blots, which will set you back in the game. Do your best to protect any weak points that your opponent might try to hit.

, If your opponent has any blots (points with only one checker), go on the offensive and hit (take) those blots. By hitting one of your opponent’s blots, you will force him/her to move the checker to the bar and roll for reentry during the next turn. This will consume time and make it harder for your opponent to advance in the game., Bearing off is when you have all of your pieces in your home board and you can begin moving them into your tray. The sooner you can get all of your pieces off of the board and into the tray, the sooner you can win the game. Get your pieces into your home board as quickly as possible to increase your chances of winning the game."

Determine who will be the box.,
Choose the first team captain.,
Decide if consulting will be permitted.,
Decide if you will play with one doubling cube or multiple doubling cubes.,
Place bets if you are betting.,
Observe the normal rules of backgammon.,
Ask about any special rules or customs that your fellow players observe.,
Have someone keep score if you are not betting.",How to Play Backgammon Chouette," Before you start a game of backgammon chouette, have each player throw a die. The player who rolls the highest number is designated as the box. That player will play against all of the other players who will form a team.In a betting game, the benefit of playing as the box is that each member of the opposite team will be required to pay you if you win. However, you will have to pay each member of the opposite team if you lose.
For example, if you are playing against three people and the bet is $1, then you would win $3 if you win the game. But if you lose the game, then you would have to pay each player $1.;
, The players who form the team that will play against the box will need to determine who will be the first captain. The captain will play against the box for the entire team. Each member of the team will get a turn to be the captain, so don’t worry if you don’t get to be captain for the first round.It is a good idea to decide on an order, so that you know who will be captain first, second, third and so on.

, When playing as the captain of a team, consulting with your teammates before you make a move can be quite helpful. But being allowed to consult with your teammates may also put the box at a great disadvantage.If your fellow players do not already have a rule about consulting with your teammates during the match, you should take a moment to decide if consulting will be allowed during this match.

, Many chouette matches are played with multiple doubling cubes so that each player and team member has a personal doubling cube. But you can still play with a single doubling cube so that only the box and captain may raise the stakes.Playing with multiple doubling cubes allows players who are observing the captain and box to raise the stakes at any time, but the double does not apply to the rest of the players.
For example, if one player chooses to double, then the double would only apply to that player and the box. Therefore if the box loses the round and the starting bet was $2, then the box would have to pay the player who doubled twice the amount of the starting bet ($4).
Keep in mind that the doubling cube can go up to 64, so the stakes can become quite high in a game of backgammon chouette.

, People often bet on backgammon chouette matches, but the game can be played with or without betting. If you are betting, then make sure that everyone places their bets prior to the start of the game. It is also a good idea to confirm that all of the players agree to the stakes.Remember that the box has to pay the bet amount for each member of the team he or she is playing against. Therefore, if the bet is $2 and there are five people on the opposing team, then the box must pay in $10 total.
If one of the players uses the doubling cube during the round, then the bet amount increases along with it. For example, if the starting bet was $2 and the box or the captain doubles once, then the new bet is $4.

, Other than the box, captain, team rotation, and betting rules, a backgammon chouette match is the same as a regular backgammon match. The box and the captain should play a normal game of backgammon and the winner (or winning team) will collect the bets at the end.If you have decided that consulting will be allowed, then the team playing against the box may advise their captain about what moves to make or when to double.

, Some backgammon clubs or players have a set of rules that they play by. Ask about these rules before you play a match with a new group of players and do your best to observe them.


For example, the Atlanta Backgammon Association does not permit consulting on doubling cube decisions, but the captain of a team may consult with his teammates regarding checker play., If you are just playing a backgammon chouette match for fun, then you should have someone keep track of the score. Players get 1 point for winning a match, unless one of the players used the doubling cube and then the points increase according to the amount of the double.If you are betting, then it is a good idea to have someone keep track of the doubling cube and determine how the doubles affect the bets.

Use your opening move to your advantage.,
Double strategically.,
Get your checkers out of your opponent’s home board.,
Hold your opponent with anchors at the bar and 20 point positions.,
Try using a blitz strategy.",How to Win at Backgammon2," The first move that you make can have a big impact on whether or not you will win the game. While you may not be able to make a good opening move in every game you play, it helps to know what to do when the dice roll is in your favor. The two best opening moves you can make are to create a prime or to move one of your pieces from the 24th point to the 13th point, also known as the “lover’s leap.”


To create a prime, you either need a 3-1, a 4-2, or a 6-1 dice roll. The 3-1 dice roll is best because them you can create an anchor on your 5th point, thereby creating a prime with the 6th point. This puts you at an advantage because your opponent will have two fewer possibilities of passing your bar.To do the lover’s leap, you need a 6-5 dice roll. Use these moves to bring your 24th point checker out to the 13th point. This move exposes your other checker to being hit, but it gives you a great advantage towards home with the other one., You can raise the stakes in a game of backgammon by using the doubling cube, but keep in mind that your opponent can also refuse your offer and end the game. In this situation, your opponent would lose. However, your opponent may end up losing fewer points than if you had not proposed a double. Therefore, it is best to propose a double when you are not too far ahead or too far behind of your opponent. That will increase the chances that your opponent will accept the offer to double., To reduce your chances of getting stuck in your opponent’s home board, you should try to get your pieces as far away from the 24th space as soon as possible. For example, if you roll a 6-5, use both numbers to move one of your checkers from the 24th point to the 13th point. Then, do the same with your other checker on the 24th space the next time you roll a 6-5., You can keep your opponent from getting to his or her home board by creating anchors near the higher points on your opponent’s board. This will prevent your opponent from getting checkers from the 24th point to the home board. It will also make it harder for your opponent to reenter checkers that have been hit and sent to the bar.You can create multiple anchors next to each other to form primes. The ideal prime is called a six-prime, 6 points next to each other that all have 2 or more checkers on each point. Creating a six-prime will make it impossible for your opponent to move towards his or her home board.

, The goal of a blitz is to hit as many of your opponent’s blots as possible while also advancing your checkers forward. Blitzing increases the odds that you will win a gammon or a backgammon and your opponent will lose more points.To blitz, begin by hitting any and all blots that your opponent leaves open during the first few turns. Try to get as many of your opponent’s checkers on the bar as possible and advance while your opponent is stuck trying to reenter the board.
Try to create some anchors near your home board to slow your opponent down even more.

Fire at the center of the board.,
Use parity to up your chances.,
Move away when you have two misses in the same segment.",How to Win at Battleship1," Statistically, you are more likely to hit a ship if you aim for the center of the board, so start there.The four by four squares in the middle of the board are likely to contain a carrier ship or battleship.;
, Imagine the board as a checkerboard, where half the squares are dark and half are light. Each ship covers at least two squares, meaning every ship must touch a dark square. Therefore, if you fire randomly at only even squares or only odd squares, you will minimize the number of turns you need to hit every ship.Once you have a hit, you will cease firing randomly and commence targeting the ship in question.
To keep track of the light and dark squares, look at your own board and imagine that the diagonal line of squares from the top left corner to the bottom right corner is dark. Imagine the squares from the to right corner to the bottom left corner are light. You can count out from there to ensure each square you're targeting is the right color.

, If you strike out twice when firing, try firing into a different segment of the board. The chances that you just missed a ship are lower than the chances that you missed by a wide margin."
"
Reduce target area after you make a hit.,
Fire around the area of your hit.,
Repeat method to hit more of your opponent’s ships.",How to Win at Battleship2," After you make your first hit, you will need to reduce your target area to the spaces surrounding the space that was a hit.Since ships in Battleship range from 2-5 spaces long, it may take you several turns to sink the ship you have hit., Begin by striking above, below, or to one side of the space you have hit to discover and hit more of the ship. If one of your strikes is a miss, try the area on the opposite side of the space that was a hit. Keep striking until you have taken your opponent’s battleship.You will know when you have taken your opponent’s ship because players are required to announce when a ship has been sunk., After you have sunk the first of your opponent’s ships, you will need to resume firing randomly (or in the center of the board) to find another ship. Then repeat the process of firing around the hit space until you have sunk another ship. Playing the game this way will reduce the amount of turns that it takes to sink all of your opponent’s battleships and it will also increase your chances of winning the game."

To reduce your opponent’s chances of finding a second battleship after hitting one, some players suggest spacing your battleships out so that they do not touch. Try to keep one or two spaces between each of your battleships to reduce the chances of your opponent finding one of your battleships., Even though having your battleships right next to each other is seen as a weakness by some players, other players see this as a potential strategy. By placing two ships so that they are touching, but not overlapping, you may be able to confuse your opponent about the type of ship they have just sunk.Keep in mind that placing ships close together can work in your favor, but it can also be a risky strategy since it may lead to your opponent discovering one or more of your other ships.

, If you play with the same opponent often, another way that you can improve your chances of winning is to place ships where your opponent seldom strikes. Keep a mental record of the spaces your opponent strikes most often and avoid these zones.For example, does your opponent tend to start their strikes on the right side of the board, to the center or in the lower left corner? Identify your opponent’s most common strike areas and avoid placing your ships in these zones.

Play against yourself.",How to Win at Chinese Checkers," The Chinese checkerboard is shaped like a star. When the game starts, you have the option to move one of four pieces at the base of your point of the star. Move the piece all the way on the right forward and to the left. At your next move, move the piece all the way on the left forward and to the right. You should be left with the two pieces sitting right next to each other one step in front of all the rest of your pieces. The idea behind starting inward is that you can make a direct route towards the center of the board. You also don’t want any lone wolf pieces, so keeping two pieces near one another is better than moving one forward alone.;
, One other common opening move is very similar to the inward opening move. Rather than moving your two pieces forward and closer to each other, move them forward and further away from each other. That means the piece all the way on the right will move up and to the right and the piece on the left will move up and to the left. This is a less common but still viable strategy. Moving your pieces outward is a fine opening move too. It also sets you up for a route directly across the board while keeping your pieces close to other pieces.

, If you watch really good Chinese checkers players you’ll notice that they always start with one of two opening moves – the two moves listed above. If you don’t start with one of these two moves you are immediately putting yourself at a strategic disadvantage.

, The best way to get a few checkers out of your area is by moving the checker on the right or left of the triangle toward your opponent's checkers. Then, you use one of the second checkers from the corner of the triangle and hop it over the third and fifth checkers.

, Similar to chess rules, if you keep your pieces away from the side they are less likely to become stranded. A great way to get pieces along the middle of the board is by setting up a zigzag line of your pieces. Then you can take the last piece in the line and hop over the other pieces. In Chinese checkers you can move forward by hopping over the pieces in front of your checker. So if you have one piece in the back and a zigzag of other pieces across the board, you can hop all the way down the line of your pieces.

, You generally want to move your marbles as a group rather than having a lead scout marble or a marble stuck in the back. If you have a marble in front or stuck in the back it is unable to use your other marbles to travel forward. Similarly, if you have a marble way in front it is of no use to the marbles behind it. Marbles can hop on one another to travel forward but they have to be next to each other for this to work.


Always look to jump your last marble forward so it doesn't get left behind. , The goal is to fill the entire tip of your opponents star with your pieces before they do the same to you. Because speed is important, you want to move your pieces as directly through the center of the board as possible. This obviously depends on how your opponent moves, but you don’t want to be moving your pieces off into unused portions of the board.


You may think you are keeping them safe, but in reality you’re just taking them out of the game and making it more difficult for yourself.

, Some players utilize a stay at home strategy. This means keeping one checker in the very tip of your star so that your opponent can never completely fill up your star. Keep in mind that you will be unable to win this way, since eventually you will need to move it out in order to fill up your opponents star.


Some consider this strategy unsportsmanlike.

, You are allowed to make as many jumps during a turn as you want. However, that's not always the best strategy. Try to pay attention not just to your own tactics but also to what your opponent is trying to accomplish. Blocking your opponent is one of the biggest parts of Chinese checkers. Put yourself in your opponent’s shoes and imagine what the next best move would be. Now think of other possible good moves, and try to guess which one you think they will do.


It might serve you well only to make a few jumps and then block your opponent from being able to move to the space that they wanted to. Constantly assess your opponent’s intentions.

, This strategy is more efficient than working from the back to the front. You’ll be able to fill your goal area with fewer moves given that you can continue to hop over your own pieces. If you can occupy the goal area more quickly than your opponent then you’ll be more likely to win. , The more you play the more comfortable you’ll be with the game and the more intuition you’ll develop. It’s much easier to anticipate moves if you have seen them before. Play as much as possible.

, If you can’t find people to play with you can always play online. Many websites have free Chinese checkers available. Set the computer difficulty to a setting that is appropriate for your skill level.

, This may seem silly, but if you are playing against yourself you’ll force yourself to think about the counters to every single move that you normally make.


If you play against yourself, you’ll be aware of the ways that you can counter your opponent. You will also be aware of the ways that they can counter your favorite moves when you play for real.

Advance pieces in close groups and in tandem.,
Trade checkers when you're ahead.,
Control the center of the board.,
Sacrifice pieces to gain advantages.,
Try a ""Trapping Pairs"" strategy.,
Use the ""Redirect Your Enemy"" strategy.,
Decide which rules of checkers to follow.,

Practice and memorize specific opening sequences.,
Play against the best opponents you can find.",How to Win at Checkers," In checkers, the person who has more kings also has the advantage. Try to crown as many pieces as possible to increase your chances of winning the game.To put this advice into practice, advance a piece toward an area on your board where your opponent has fewer pieces, or pieces that are more spread out. If you can protect this piece with nearby pieces and sacrifices, then you have a good chance at making a king.
See Intermediate Strategies below for how to ""redirect the enemy"" and sneak through a king.;
, It's impossible for your opponent to crown his or her pieces if your back row is occupied, so this strategy will prevent your opponent from getting the advantage too soon in the game. You will also have more movement options left when you do start moving your back row pieces.Remember that you won't be able to keep your back row intact forever. Once you're low on pieces or you see an opportunity for an advantageous trade, don't hesitate to move out.

, Two pieces ""in tandem"" are adjacent to each other on a diagonal line. Keeping pieces near enough to form tandem in one move makes it much harder for your opponent to capture them.""Following"" a piece you moved earlier before you move it again will leave your front piece less open to capture. Following it with two pieces is even safer, since you can block capture from two directions.
See Intermediate Strategies to learn how to form ""trapping pairs"".

, It's obvious that trading one of your checkers for two of your opponent's checkers benefits you, but even trading one for one is useful if you had more checkers to begin with.For example, if you have 5 checkers and your opponent has 4 checkers, then the board is almost equal. But once you trade three pieces each, you have a huge advantage with twice as many pieces as your opponent (2 to 1)!

, If you keep a few pieces near the center, you will keep your options open and be able to move rapidly to whichever side of the board needs your attention. Likewise, preventing your opponent from placing pieces in the center will deny him or her this advantage.It takes practice to judge how many pieces you need to commit to the center in a particular game. As a general rule, you should try to build up enough of a position that the opponent is unable to safely advance anywhere except the left and right edges. After that goal is achieved, adding more of your pieces can actually clog up your board and lower your options., The ""forced capture"" rule requires a player to make a capture if they are able to. Think ahead to what the board will look like if you force your opponent to capture your piece and you might discover it's worth the sacrifice.


If you're trying to crown a piece but your opponent is pursuing it, you can sacrifice a less important piece to lure the pursuer away from your soon-to-be king.If you have a diagonal line of pieces, moving the forward one toward the enemy can force a capture that places the enemy piece next to another of yours. Make sure you don't open yourself up to a double capture!, To use the ""Trapping Pairs"" strategy, you need to wait for a certain setup on the board. Your first checker (piece 1) should be in the leftmost or rightmost column, against the edge of the board. Your second checker (piece 2) should be one row in front of your first checker on the diagonal. Following that same diagonal, there should be an empty space, then one of your opponent's checkers(piece A), then another opponent checker (piece B) one row behind.Move piece 2 toward your opponent's pieces, so that it is in danger of being captured.
The forced capture rule requires your opponent's piece A to jump piece 2, but it cannot then jump piece 1 because it is against the edge of the board.
After your opponent has captured your piece 2, the you can use your piece 1 to jump piece A.
In the basic scenario described, this is an unexciting 1-for-1 trade. However, after setting up your trapping pair, you can often wait to ""trigger"" it until the opportunity for a double capture arises.

, To use ""Redirect Your Enemy,"" you will need to designate 6 pieces on one side of your board as group A and the other 6 on the other side as group B. You will use these designations to determine what pieces you move at different times in the game.Move the pieces in A group almost exclusively at the start of the game, only occasionally moving a B piece when there is no good A move.
When you begin trading pieces with your opponent, trade A pieces over B pieces whenever possible.
Once a few capture exchanges have happened, your opponent will likely be concentrated on the side of the board with your A pieces. Begin advancing your B pieces in groups and you'll be in a strong position to crown past your opponent's depleted defenses.

, Some tournaments are run using basic checkers rules, referred to as Go As You Please, GAYP, or freestyle. Others follow the 3-move rules, which limit players' options at the start of the game to a set of three move sequences. (The 3-move rules greatly reduce the possibility of a draw between skilled players.), More recent books will contain up-to-date strategic advances, but this is less important if you're a beginner. Browsing the checkers shelf at a library or bookstore can help you find a book that is helpful and fun to read., For 3-move play, find an encyclopedia of 3-move openers. For GAYP rules, select a preferred opener and practice games with every possible response from your opponent.Memorizing specific board states from the mid-game and endgame can be useful as well, but you're much less likely to encounter a specific midgame in a tournament than one of the standard openers.

, Playing against more experienced players who are willing to share their knowledge is a great way to improve your game. Whether that means entering tournaments or finding your local amateur expert, the better your opponents are, the more you'll learn."

Give each player a battleship box.,
Check that all the ship pieces are there.,
Have each player secretly arrange their ships.,
Decide who will play first.",How to Play Battleship1," The standard Battleship game set comes with two boxes, one for each player. Each box opens to reveal two grids, one on each inside surface.


If your game set does not include two boxes, plenty of red and white pegs, and at least six ship pieces, it will be difficult to use. Try playing on graph paper instead, as described below, or finding an online version of the game.;
, Ships come in various lengths, taking up a different number of squares on the grid. The two players should have identical collections of ships. The following is the typical list, but if you don't have all the pieces, just make sure both sides are even:A single ship five squares long (the aircraft carrier)
A single ship four squares long (the battleship)
Two ships three squares long (the cruiser and the submarine)
A single ship two squares long (the destroyer)

, With the boxes open, and the players seated across from each other, each player puts his ships down on the lower grid in front of him. Follow these rules to determine where to put your ships:


Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
You must place all five ships on the grid.
Every ship must be completely on the grid. No ship can hang off the edge of the board.
Ships cannot overlap each other.
Once your ships are placed and the game has begun, you are not allowed to move your ships again.

, If the two players don't agree who should go first right away, flip a coin or decide in some other randomized way. If you are playing multiple games in a row, consider letting the player who lost the last game go first in the next one.

Talk to your partner.,
Gesticulate wildly and have a conversation with yourself.,
State categorically that you have no idea what the other person is on about.,
Come clean.",How to Pretend You Are Not Spying on Someone," This is a flip-side to successfully spying; you also need to know how to deal with getting caught. Thus, you need to be prepared to come up with believable excuses that cause people to think that you're either not spying at all or to plant doubt in their mind that what they thought they saw was actually something else.

, Make it look like you were trying to recognize them and suddenly realized that it is them and act all friendly. You could even holler out something like: ""Oh! It is you! I was not sure there for a second and was trying to figure it out. So great to see you again."";
, Acknowledge their presence as if it's perfectly normal, then be on your way as if you're going about your normal everyday business. Just don't make a big deal out of it.

, In some cases, it might be best to duck down among a group of people to ""disappear"" or to weave in and out of such a crowd. You could appear to merge into the sea of people and have the person thinking twice about whether or not they saw you at all.

, Initiate a conversation about the weather, the day, work, whatever. Act as if everything is perfectly normal and that you weren't behaving oddly before at all. It'll be hard for them to feel spied on if you're acting all chummy.

, If you're on the street or in a store, you can simply play act at checking out the merchandise or picking things up to find their prices or brand information.

, Say that you didn't mean to stare or be rude but you were taken in by the beauty of their outfit and felt mesmerized. If you turn it into an issue of apologizing about your lack of manners, all ideas of spying will be forgotten about.

, Say that you were looking about for it everywhere and ask the person if they've happened to see the object anywhere.

, Say that you're lost and ask them if they know where X dentist/doctor/hair salon is. Act flustered about being late.

, If you have brought along a spying partner, start talking to each other in earnest, acting as if you're just out for the day together and that you haven't really noticed the person at all.

, Acting eccentric or self involved may well be enough to put the other person right off the scent. Or, make it clear that you're actually having a conversation on your phone (fake it) and that whatever you're being told is causing you to react with vigor. A bit of acting can make it all seem bizarre and surreal, hopefully leading the other person to forget suspicions about spying.

, Tell them until you're blue in the face that you have no clue how that spy app got on their phone or why you just happen to keep popping up in the same location as them all the day long.

, Say ""Yep, I've been spying on you. It's for my class project on seeing how people react when they know they're being watched."" Good luck with this excuse, especially if the person contacts your teacher or lecturer to confirm it. Or, you could just say: ""Well, I'm not spying as such. I'm people watching. It dawned on me at the same time you notice me people watching that you were in the crowd too, how's that for an amazing coincidence?"".

For a solo game, you then input the skill level when prompted by pressing ""1,"" ""2,"" or ""3."" Level 1 is the easiest level; Level 3 is the most challenging.

, Electronic Battleship has 4 mission levels:

Classic Mission � You use all 5 of your ships, but not your Reconnaissance Planes. Each turn, you fire a single shot. Press ""1"" to select this mission.
Salvo Mission � Plays like Classic Mission, except that you fire 1 shot for each ship still afloat. (You can fire 5 shots if all 5 of your ships are in play; if your opponent sinks 2 of them, you can then fire only 3 shots.) Press ""2"" to select this mission.
Bonus Mission � Plays like Classic Mission, except that you get another shot if you score a hit on 1 of your opponent's ships and can keep shooting as long as you score a hit. Press ""3"" to select this mission.
Advanced Mission � Each of your vessels is equipped with special attacks in the form of missiles, torpedoes, or scanning capabilities. You also have Reconnaissance Planes and Anti-aircraft Guns to shoot them down. Press ""4"" to select this mission. (It's recommended that you become proficient with the other 3 missions before playing the Advanced Mission.)

, Each player can choose the position of his or her ships or select from 100 different pre-programmed configurations. (One player may choose a pre-programmed formation, while the other may choose a custom configuration.)

Press ""1"" to use a pre-programmed configuration. Formations are displayed in the back of the game manual; enter the letter-number code for the configuration you want to use and then place your ships accordingly on the horizontal surface in front of you. (Use the Reconnaissance Planes only if you are playing the Advanced Mission.)
Press ""2"" to use a custom configuration. The game will prompt you to place each of your vessels on the horizontal surface in front of you, from the longest in length (the Aircraft Carrier) to the shortest (the Patrol Boat). You only have to enter the letter and number coordinates (in that order) of each end of the vessel.
Once both players have configured their fleets, the game will report, ""General quarters, general quarters; man your battle stations. This is not a drill, repeat, this is not a drill!""

Learn how to take a shot.,
Learn how to respond to an enemy shot.,
Keep track of shots as they hit or miss.,
Announce when each ship gets sunk.,
Take turns shooting until one player has lost all their ships.",How to Play Battleship2," Each player uses the upper grid of her box, without any ships placed on it, to keep track of her ""shots"" at the enemy ships. To take a shot, pick a square on this grid by naming it using the coordinates with the letters on the left and numbers above the grid.


For example, the square in the top left corner of the grid is named ""A-1,"" since it is in the row labeled A and the column labeled 2.
To the right of A-1 is A-2, then A-3, etc.

, After player 1 announces where she will be ""shooting,"" player 2 checks the same coordinate square on his lower grid, the one with his ships. Player 2 then responds (telling the truth!) one of the following ways:


If player 1 hit an empty square, without ships, player 2 says ""Miss!""
If player 1 hit a square with a ship in it, player 2 says ""Hit!""
In most ""official"" rules that come with game sets, the player must also announce which ship was hit (for instance, aircraft carrier).However, many people do not play with this rule.

, If player 1 misses with a shot, she puts a white peg into that hole of her upper grid, and player 2 puts a white peg into that hole of his lower grid. If player 1 hits, both players use a red peg instead, with player 2 putting the peg directly into the hole on top of the ship where it was shot.


You don't need to keep track of your opponent's misses on your own lower grid, if you don't want to. You do need to keep track of your opponent's successful hits, however, so you know when a ship has been sunk.

, If every square of a ship gets shot, that ship is sunk. The player who placed that ship must tell his opponent ""You sunk my ___,"" naming the type of ship that was sunk.


The names of each ship are listed in the set up section. If you forget them, you can instead say ""You sunk the ship with __ squares.""

, Players alternate taking one shot at a time, whether or not that shot is successful. Whoever manages to sink all of her opponent's ships first wins the game.

Outline four 10 x 10 grids.,
Draw the outline of your ships on your grid.,
Play with the ordinary rules.",How to Play Battleship3," Draw four boxes on the graph paper, each one 10 squares wide and 10 squares long. Have each of the two players take two boxes, labeling one ""my ships"" and the other ""enemy ships."", Hide the box labeled ""my ships"" from the other player, and draw a thick outline of five ships anywhere within its boundaries. Each ship is one square wide, and ranges in length:


Draw one ship five squares long (the aircraft carrier)
Draw one ship four squares long (the battleship)
Draw two ships three squares long (the cruiser and the submarine)
Draw one ship two squares long (the destroyer)

, Use the instructions above to play an ordinary game of Battleship. Instead of using pegs, draw successful hits with Xs and misses with dots, or use any system of symbols you find easy to understand. Use the box labeled ""enemy ships"" to keep track of the shots you've taken, and the box labeled ""my ships"" to keep track of your enemy's shots.

"
"
Try the original ""salvo"" rules.,
Reduce the number of shots you get as you lose ships.,
Make the game even harder with advanced salvo rules.",How to Play Battleship4," Once you've played the basic game for a while, you might want to try something a little more challenging. In ""Salvo,"" take your turn by firing five shots at once. The opponent responds as normal, telling you which shots were hits and which were misses, but only after you've selected five squares to aim for.This version of the game was played at least as early as 1931.

, Increase the tension, and reward the player who sinks the first ship, by adding this additional rule to the ""salvo"" rues above. Instead of firing five shots at a time, each player only gets to fire one shot for each surviving ship. For example, if player one loses the cruiser and is down to four ships, player one only gets four shots per turn.

, Play with the original salvo rules above, but don't tell the opponent exactly which shots were hits or misses. Instead, tell them how many of the shots hit, and how many missed.This results in a complicated game, and is only recommended for advanced players.


Because you don't know for sure which squares were hits, the ordinary red peg / white peg system probably won't work well for this variation. You may need a pencil and pad of paper for each player, to write down each salvo and the opponent's response.

Pay attention to what you wear on your feet.,
If your nose is clear without any excess mucus in it, take small breaths through the nose, only taking in the air you really need.,
Wear camouflage for disguise.,
When going up the stairs, stay close to the wall to avoid any creaking.,
Don't dress in baggy, overlong, stiff clothes (blue jeans should not be worn), they will make noise as you walk that can alert people to your presence.,
Don't wear anything that dangles.,
To walk quietly, a fluid heel-to-balls-of-feet motion is the best.,
If you have to get close to a person, walk on the outside edge of your feet, from your heel to your pinkie toe.,
To run quietly with speed, run on the balls of your feet.,
If by bad luck someone stirs, looks up/around or looks in your general direction, don't move.",How to Poke Around Quietly," Never wear anything with hard or high heels--clomping around and falling down on the ground is the last thing you would want to do! If poking around in your house, dry socks work great. Be sure not to step in a wet puddle or anything, if you do, your feet will squeak loudly! If outside of your home, comfortable, well-fitting shoes with soft soles and shoelaces work well. Flip-flops aren't that great, they are extremely loud when going down the stairs!;
, If you are sick and/or your nose is congested, open your mouth and take deep but controlled breaths.

, When slinking around at night, never wear pure black because moonlight or a street lamp can cast your shadow against the ground and you want to blend in completely with your surroundings. The night is never completely dark! Generally, don't wear bright colors with glitter, sequins or anything reflective as decorations, they can betray you!

, Walking on the very edge works just as well.

, If for any reason you must wear baggy clothes, make sure that the fabric is fairly soft, like cotton. Snow pants, for example, make far too much sound.

, Earrings are fine because they just swing against your head and neck, but not that cute belt you got the other day! If you prefer to pull your shoelaces a little tighter than you usually would, weave the bow through your shoelaces or push them into your shoe next to your feet (this might feel a little uncomfortable at first, but your feet will quickly get used to it).

, If you have to walk on gravel, do the same thing, except crouch down and put your other foot down just as you get to the balls of your first foot. You shouldn't be able to hear any individual steps. Walking on the sides of your feet is better for staying quiet.

, This can get uncomfortable after a while, though, so use this technique carefully.

, This demands flexibility, muscle coordination, and more balance in different parts of your feet than regular running, so if you tire easily from this kind of running, running from--like before--your heel to the balls of your feet helps. However, running with only the balls of the feet is the faster and quieter way to travel or follow somebody.

, You're in camouflage, remember, and you want to minimize movement so it would be harder to spot something when someone is looking at you.

Listen for the game's prompt: ""Awaiting orders from Player (1 or 2)."",
Place a white marking peg on the target grid coordinate where you intend to fire.,
Enter the coordinate you're targeting.,
Continue until all 5 ships on one side are sunk.",How to Play Electronic Battleship2,", The target grid is the upright grid in between the 2 players., Press the letter key first, then the number key, then ""Fire/Enter."" A red light will flash to show your missile has been launched.

If you hit an enemy vessel, the game reports, ""Radar confirms hit at,"" followed by the coordinate you entered. Replace the white peg on your target grid with a red peg; your opponent will mark the hit on his or her ship at that coordinate with a red peg.
If there is no enemy vessel at that coordinate, the game reports, ""Radar confirms miss at,"" followed by the coordinate. Leave the white peg in place.
Keep an accurate record of your shots so that you can figure out where your opponent's ships are placed. If you should fire onto a space where you previously recorded a hit, the game will record the second shot to that location as a miss.
When all the spaces a ship occupies on the board record a hit, the game will report the ship as sunk. For example, when your Battleship takes a hit to each of its 4 spaces, the game will report, ""Target neutralized � battleship sunk."" (You then have option to whine as in the TV commercial: ""You sank my battleship!"")

, At this point, the game announces, ""Enemy fleet destroyed. Congratulations, Admiral."""

Familiarize yourself with the game board.,
Choose your starting triangles.,
Know how many pegs to use.,
Flip a coin.,
Take turns.,
Move into one adjacent hole at a time.The most basic way to move one of your pegs is to move it into an adjacent hole.,
Hop over other pegs.,
Do not remove your pegs.,
Aim for the opposing triangle.,
Do not move pegs out of the destination triangle.,
Win by filling your destination triangle.,
Establish rules governing ""blocked"" holes.,
Determine rules about potential forfeits.",How to Play Chinese Checkers," The shape of the board is a six-pointed star, and each point has ten holes inside of it.


The inner hexagon portion of the board is also filled with peg holes. Each side of the hexagon has five holes along it.
With most Chinese Checkers boards, each triangular point has a different color. There are also six sets of marbles or pegs, and each colored set corresponds to a colored point.;
, The triangles you use will depend on the number of players you have. Play the game with two, three, four, or six players.


If playing with six players, use all six triangles.
If playing with two or four players, use pairs of opposing triangles. In other words, for a two-player game, the triangle of Player A should lie directly across from the starting triangle of Player B. For a four-player game, two sets of these opposing triangles should be used.
If playing with three players, play every other triangle. There should be an empty triangle in between the starting triangles of each player.

, In an ordinary game, you should use the ten marble pegs that correspond to the color of your triangle.


Not all Chinese Checkers boards have color-coded triangles, however. In this case, you can choose any colored set of pegs you wish.
While most games are traditionally played with ten pegs regardless of how many players you have, if desired, you can vary the number of pegs based on the number of players. A full six-player game would use ten marbles, while each player in a four-player game would use 13 and each player in a two-person game would use 19 marbles., The game typically starts with a coin toss.


Flip a coin into the air and predict if the coin will land on its ""heads"" or ""tails"" side. Whichever player guesses correctly the greatest number of times is chosen to be the starting player.
You could also use other ""luck of the draw"" methods to determine who starts. For instance, you could play a game of rock-paper-scissors.

, After the first person takes his or her turn, the person to that player's left should take a turn next. Continue moving around the board in this matter, traveling to the left until you reach the first player again. The cycle then repeats.


There is traditionally no reason to skip over a player's turn. If all the players agree to it, however, you could establish a rule that permits players to ""pass"" for one turn.
You could create other rules about skipping turns, as well. A common ""added"" rule to apply is that the first player to get a marble into their target triangle must skip his or her next turn. While common, though, this rule is not an official part of Chinese Checkers.

,


When your turn comes, look for empty holes that are next to the marble you want to move. You can move one marble into one empty hole like this per turn, unless you choose to ""hop"" your peg over another peg, instead.
Pegs can move in any direction: side to side, forward, or backward.

, The other way to move your peg is to ""hop"" over adjacent pegs into a vacant hole on the other side.


During your turn, you can move your peg into an empty hole that is situated directly on the other side of another peg. There must only be one peg blocking you from the empty hole, and the empty hole must be directly beyond that peg and in the same direction as the peg itself in relation to the peg you move.
You can only ""hop"" over a peg during your turn if you have not already moved into a vacant hole directly adjacent to your peg during the same turn.
You can hop over any peg, including your own.
You can hop over pegs in any direction.
Additionally, you can continue to hop over as many pegs as you want during a single turn, as long as you only move one peg. Each peg you hop over must be directly adjacent to your peg's current position. This is the only way to move a peg more than once during a turn, and it is theoretically possible to hop your way across the entire board in one turn using this tactic.

, Unlike traditional Checkers, you do not remove pegs from a Chinese Checkers board once those pegs have been jumped or hopped over.

, You can move pegs in any direction across the board. You can even move them into other triangles that are not currently in use. Ultimately, however, you should aim to pile all your pegs into the triangle directly across from your starting triangle.

, Once you move one of your pegs into the opposing triangle, you cannot move it out of the triangle for the rest of the game. You can move it within that triangle, though.


Pegs that are moved into other triangles can still be moved out.

, The winning player is the first person to move all of his or her marbles into the triangle lying directly across from his or her starting triangle.


Once a winner has been established, it is your decision whether to stop the game or continue on. Traditionally, the game ends with one winner, and the rest of the players lose. If you want to continue playing until every player has filled his or her destination triangle, though, you may do so.

, With Chinese Checkers, it is legitimate to ""block"" a player from winning by occupying one of the holes in his or her destination triangle, thereby preventing that player from filling the triangle first.One rule you can implement is a rule which states that a player who is prevented from moving a peg into a destination triangle can swap that peg with the one blocking it.
Another rule you can use is that, if one or more filled holes in an occupied triangle are filled with other players' pegs, these pegs actually count toward the blocked player's victory. If that player has filled all the non-blocked holes within his or her destination triangle, that player wins.

, Even though it is not an official rule, many players choose to enact a rule stating that a player must forfeit the game if he or she is unable to move any pegs during a turn.


If this happens, the losing player must remove his or her pegs from the board and sit out the rest of the game.

The person who will go first will take the black checkers and the other will take the white.Keep in mind that in checkers, the player with the black checkers always goes first.;
, Sit across from your opponent and place the board between you and your opponent. The board is made up of 64 alternating dark and light squares which appear in 8 rows of 8. There are 32 light squares and 32 dark squares. Place the board so that each player has a light colored square on the corner of the board on his or her right side., Have each player place his pieces on the 12 dark squares in the first three rows closest to him or her. Each of these three rows should have a total of 4 checkers. Keep in mind that checkers may only move in diagonal directions on the dark squares.Since the board has 8 rows, 6 of the rows will be taken up by the players' checkers and two rows will be left open in the middle of the board.

, In tournament checkers games, each player gets five minutes to make a move. If you want to time each other’s moves to keep the game moving along, make sure that you place a timer near the checkers board before you begin a game., The player with the black checkers moves first. Checkers may only move one diagonal space forward (toward your opponent’s checkers) in the beginning of the game. Remember that checkers must stay on the dark squares., If your checker is located in the diagonal space nearest to your opponent's checker, then you can jump and capture that checker. To capture a checker, just jump over it by moving two diagonal spaces in the direction of the checker, like you are hopping over your opponent's checker. Once you capture the checker, you can take it off the board.Keep in mind that a space on the other side of your opponent’s checker has to be empty so that you can move into it.
If you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker, then you have to take it.
If you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker in multiple parts of the board, then you can choose which checkers you'd like to jump.
If you're capturing a checker, you can still only move forward once. But if the new position you land in gives you a direct opportunity to capture another checker, then you must keep going until you can't jump any more of your opponent's checkers.

, To crown a checker and make it a king checker, simply place one of your own captured pieces on top of it. Because of its height, you will be able to tell it apart from the other pieces. The king can move forward and backward, so it's easier for king checkers to capture your opponent's checkers.Kings can still only move one diagonal space at a time during a non-capture move. However, when a king is capturing checkers, it can move forward and backward on the same turn. This would apply only if a a king was doing a capture move that required it to change directions, such as if two checkers were lined up on diagonal spaces that fall into the same horizontal line. To capture these checkers, the king would have to jump forwards and then backwards.
Some checkers sets have a crown on the back of the checkers, so you can just flip a piece over once it is crowned to designate it as the king.
There is no limit to how many crowned pieces you can have.

, Continue jumping and capturing your opponent's checkers until they are all removed from the board. Once you have captured all of your opponent’s checkers, you have won the game!A less common way to win is when all of your opponent's pieces are blocked so that your opponent can't make any more moves.

, A beginner may be tempted to keep his pieces at the edges of the board and to try to avoid the opponent's checkers as much as possible, but this is a mistake. Work on capturing your opponent’s checkers rather than going out of your way to defend your own. It’s okay if some of your pieces get captured as long as you capture more of your opponent’s pieces.


Be bold and try to capture your opponent's checkers whenever you can.

, If you move a stray checker a few squares forward without moving the rest of your checkers, that piece will be vulnerable to capture. Instead, try keeping some of your checkers together, like a blockade. The center of the board is a good place to a have a group of checkers protecting each other as they move forward. Just try not to move all of your checkers towards the center because it will be hard to move them.If your checkers move together, it will be harder for your opponent to capture your checkers. But if your opponent does still manage to capture your checker, then you'll have a piece waiting to capture his checker as well.

, If your opponent gets a piece to your back row, then it will be crowned and more difficult to capture. Keeping a full back row is the best way to keep your opponent from crowning his pieces. It will also make it easier for you to capture any opposing pieces that approach your back row., There's a right time for you to sacrifice your checkers. If you're ahead in the game, or even dead even with your opponent, don't be afraid to sacrifice a piece if it means you'll be able to capture your opponent's piece back or gain a significant positional advantage. Keep the forward momentum going.Do what you can to avoid having your king captured. The king is much more valuable than a regular checker.
Don't trade pieces if it will make it easier for your opponent to king a piece.
Trade one for two. Give up one of your pieces if it means you can capture two of your opponent's pieces in return.

, You should focus on crowning as many of your pieces as possible, as well as on keeping your opponent from crowning his pieces. This should be a priority as you advance in the game. However, don't crown your pieces if it means losing several checkers on the way. Be strategic about knowing when to crown your piece.

, Try to keep his active pieces blocked if you can, so he will be forced to play with pieces such as those in the back row. If all your opponent's pieces are blocked and cannot move, then he will lose. You can also work on capturing more of your opponent’s pieces or crowning your own.

, Though there's no fool-proof way to win at checkers every single time, the more you play, the more you'll understand how to strategize. If you want to be a checkers expert, you should try to play as much as you can to improve your game.Try playing with someone above your skill level. This will challenge you and will force you to pick up your game.

, Watch an expert checkers player, either in person or on television. You'll pick up a lot of pointers just by watching an expert maneuver his pieces around the board. Pay attention to what the expert does in certain situations.Try reading about checkers strategies online or in books as well. Some checkers experts have written about their strategies and reading about them may help you to improve your game.

Play again.",How to Play Backgammon," Backgammon is played on a board that consists of 24 narrow triangles that are called points. The triangles alternate in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. There are four types of quadrants: the player's home board and outer board, and the opponent's home board and outer board. The intersection of these four quadrants, the middle of the board, is separated by a ridge called the bar.The players sit facing each other at opposite sides of the board when they play. Each player's home board is positioned on the right quadrant closest to the player. The home boards are opposite each other, and so are the outer boards, which are located in the left quadrant.
The player moves his checkers from the direction of the other player's home board in a horse-shoe like direction, moving counterclockwise.
The triangles are numbered from 1-24 in most of the Backgammon boards, with the 24th point being the furthest point from the player, and with 1 being the right most triangle on the player's home court. The players must move their pieces from opposite sides of the board, so one player's 1st point is the other player's 24th point, one player's 2nd point is the other player's 23rd point, and so on.;
, Each player must set up his 15 checkers for the game to begin. The players' checkers will be comprised of two distinct colors, traditionally white and red, or white and black but it can also be other colors. To set up the board, each player must place two checkers on their 24 point, three checkers on his 8 point, five checkers on his 13 point, and five more checkers on his 6 point.Remember that each player has his own numbering system, so the checkers will not overlap.

, The player who rolls the highest number will go first. If both players roll the same number, roll again. The numbers rolled will count as the first moves for the player with the highest number. For example, if one player rolled a 5 and the other rolled a 2, then the player who rolled the 5 would go first and use the 5 and 2 in lieu of a new dice roll., In backgammon, the winner doesn't gain points, but the loser loses points. So if you win, the opponent will either lose based on the face value, double value, or triple value of the stakes on the doubling cube. The doubling cube isn't a die but a marker. It starts at 1, but you can raise the stakes at any time at the beginning of your turn before you have rolled the dice.If you want to double the stakes and your partner accepts, then the cube is turned to the new number and placed in your opponent's court. He will have ownership of the cube and will be able to propose a doubling during any of his future turns.
If your opponent does not accept your offer, he must forfeit the game and lose by the original stakes.
You can keep doubling the stakes back and forth, or redoubling, but it's not traditionally done more than three or four times in a game.

, Use a dice tumbler to roll two six-sided dice once during each of your turns. The numbers rolled represent two separate moves. For example, if you roll a 3 and a 5, you can move one checker three spaces and another checker 5 spaces. Or, you can move one checker 3 spaces and then 5 more spaces.Make sure that you roll the dice to the right of your side of the board, from a reasonable height so that they bounce and roll a bit.
If either of the dice lands on a checker, outside of the board, or leaning against the edge of the board, then it is not considered valid and you will have to reroll.

, An open point is any point on the board that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers. You can move your checkers to a point with no checkers on it, a point with one or more of your checkers on it, or a point with one of your opponent's checkers on it. Remember that you should always move your checkers counter-clockwise, moving from your opponent's home court to your own.You can start with any checker you chose, but it is a good idea to get your checkers out of your opponent’s home board as soon as possible.
You only need 2 checkers to block a point, but you can have as many of your checkers as you want on a single point.
Remember that you can either move one checker twice or move two checkers once. For example, if you roll a 3-2, you can move one checker 3 points over and then 2 points over, as long as it lands on an open point both times. Alternately, you can move one checker 2 points over to an open point, and move another checker 3 points over to an open point.

, If you roll the same number on both dice, then you've earned yourself two extra moves. If you roll double 3s, for example, then you can make four moves of 3 points each.Again, you can move four checkers 3 times, move one checker 3 times if it lands on an open point after every move, or mix it up and move two checkers 6 times, or one checker 3 times and another checker 9 times. As long as the total moves add up to 12 and each move lands in an open point, you're in good shape.

, For example, if you roll a 5-6, but you can't find an open point when moving any checker either 5 or 6 times, then you lose your turn. If you can only play one of the numbers, then you can play that number and lose your turn on the other number. If you can only play one number or the other, then you have to play the higher number.This rule applies even if you roll doubles. If you can't play the doubled number you've rolled, you lose your turn.

, Try to avoid having just one of your checkers on a point because the point, which is called a blot, is vulnerable to being “hit” by your player's checkers. If one of your checker’s gets hit, then it will go to the bar and you will have to use your next turn to roll and try to reenter the board in your opponent’s home board. Do your best to keep at least two of your checkers on a point, at least early in the game., Before you start moving your pieces into your home court, you should try to have many points occupied by 2 or 3 checkers instead of just a few points occupied by 5 or 6 checkers. This will not only give you more options to move to open points, but will also make it harder for your opponent to move to an open point., If you hit a blot, a point occupied by just one of your opponent's checkers, then the opponent's checkers will be placed on the bar. You should try to hit the blots whenever possible, as long as it helps you move your pieces as close to your home court as possible. This is a great way to slow down your opponent.Any time a player's checker is on the bar, he can't move his other checkers until he gets the bar checker back on the home board.

, If a player hits a blot with one of your pieces on it, then you have to place your own checker on your bar. Your task is now to move that checker back onto the opposing home board. You can do this by rolling the dice and then moving the checker onto an open point on your opponent's home board, if you roll an open number. If you do not roll an open number, then you lose your turn and you will have to try again on your next turn.For example, if you roll a 2, you can enter your piece on the 23 mark on your opponent's home court, provided that it's open. This is because you're moving your checker two points over from the bar.
You may not use the sum of the two numbers to choose a space. For example, if you roll a 6 and a 2, you cannot add them and move your piece onto the 8th point. You can only move your checker onto the 6th or the 2nd point to reenter.

, Once you get your checker(s) off the bar and back onto the board, you can move your other checkers again. If you only had one checker to enter, then you can use the other number that you rolled to move one of your other checkers.If you have two checkers on the bar, you have to enter them both before you can move any other checkers. If you can only enter one checker during a dice roll, then you will have to try again on your next turn.
If you have more than two checkers on the bar, you can only move your other checkers once all the checkers on the bar are entered.

, To win the game, you need to be the first one to bear off or remove all of your checkers from the board and into your tray. To bear off your checkers, you need to roll both dice and use the numbers to move pieces into the tray. The numbers you roll must be exact or higher than the number of spaces needed to remove each piece from the board.For example, if you roll a 6-2, you can bear off two pieces that are on these points. But if you do not have a checker on the 6 point, you can bear it off from the next highest point on your board, such as the 5th or 4th point.

, You can only start bearing off your checkers once they are all in your home court. To begin bearing off, get all of your checkers into the 1-6 points on your board. They can be placed on any of these points. Don't forget that your checkers are still vulnerable when they're in your own home court.If the opposing player has a checker on the bar, then he can still enter it into a blot on your court if you have any, forcing you to take out one of your pieces and move it all the way back to the 24th spot. After that, you can't continue bearing off until it's back in the home court.

, When bearing off, you can only bear off checkers that occupy the corresponding point. For example, if you rolled a 4-1, and you have a checker in the 4th and 1st point, you can bear them off. If your roll double sixes and have four checkers on the 6th point, you can bear off all six.If you still have a die to play and no checker to bear off, you must move a checker according to the number on the die. For example, if you only have two checkers remaining in the 6th and 5th points and you roll a 2-1, then you can move the checker on the 6th point over to the 4th point, and the checker on the 5th point over to the 4th point.
You can use a higher roll to bear off a die on a lower point. If you roll a 5-4 and you only have a few checkers remaining in the 3rd and 2nd points, you can bear off two of these checkers.
You must move a lower die roll before a higher one even if it means you can't fully use the full value of a die. For example, if you have a checker in the 5 point and roll a 5-1, you must first move the checker over 1 to the 4 point and then bear it off using the 5 value.

, If you bear off all fifteen of your checkers before your opponent does, then you have won the game of backgammon. But not all wins are created equal. Your opponent can lose in one of three ways:A regular loss. This happens if you bore off all of your checkers first while your opponent was trying to bear off his checkers. Your opponent will lose only the value on the doubling cube.
The gammon. If you bear off all of your checkers before your opponent bears off any of his, he is gammoned and loses twice the value on the doubling cube.
The backgammon. If you bore off all of your checkers while your opponent still has checkers on the bar or your home court, then your opponent is backgammon and loses three times the value on the doubling cube.

, Backgammon is meant to be played more than once, since each game is worth a certain amount of points. You can even set a goal to play until the losing player loses a certain amount of points.If you want to keep playing more games but can't do it in one sitting, you can keep a tally of the points lost by each player and return to the game at another time.

Make sure that you understand the rules of regular Battleship.,
Get your ships and pegs.,
Set up the game as usual.,
Call out 5 shots per turn to start.,
Keep track of shots called on your grid.,
Place red pegs at the top of your board to indicate a sunk ship.,
Use red pegs to indicate when your opponent has hit one of your ships.,
Announce when a ship has been hit or sunk.,
Win the game by sinking all of your opponent’s ships.","How to Play ""Salvo"" Battleship"," The Salvo variation of Battleship is similar to the regular version of Battleship. The major difference is in the number of shots called per turn.This version of the game is recommended for more experienced Battleship players, so if you are new to the game you may want to practice the regular version a bit more before trying Salvo.;
, Each player gets 5 ships and some red and white pegs. You should have more white pegs than red pegs, since it is likely that you will call more misses than hits as you play the game. Keep your red and white pegs in the storage trays attached to your game board. Put the red pegs in the smaller tray and the white pegs in the larger tray., Each player gets 5 ships to start and they may place those ships anywhere on the board. The ships cannot be placed in positions that are diagonal or overlapping. But they can be placed next to each other or spread out around the board. Once you have placed your ships, you cannot move them. Hang on to our pegs until the game gets underway., In Salvo, you get to call out more shots per turn, which is what makes it more challenging. In the beginning of your game, you will call out 5 shots per turn because you have 5 ships. As you lose ships, you will have fewer shots.For example, if your opponent sinks one of your ships and you are left with only 4, then you will only get to call out 4 shots on your next turn.

, Use the red pegs to record the ships that hit your opponent’s ships and the white pegs to indicate shots that missed your opponent’s ships. This will help to ensure that the shots you call on your turns are not ones that you have called already. It will also help you to determine the areas where your opponent has ships that you need to sink., After your opponent has sunk one of your ships, make sure that you place a red peg at the top of the Battleship board. It should be visible to you and your opponent., Any time your opponent makes a hit on one of your ships, it is also important to place a red peg in the ship over the space that was a hit. This will help you to keep track of the hits that your opponent has made on your ships and determine when your opponent has sunk one of your ships., Every time your opponent hits or sinks one of your ships, you are required to announce the hit or sunk ship. Make sure that you say what space was a hit and which ship was hit.For example, if your opponent calls D-1, A-4, B-3, E-6, and F-9, you might respond with, “F-9 was a hit on my Destroyer.”

, As in regular Battleship, you win by sinking all of your opponent’s ships. Your opponent must announce every time a ship has been sunk as well as when you have sunk his or her last ship."

Understand the backgammon board.,
Have each player take his or her 15 checkers.,
Take two checkers and put them on your 24-point.,
Position five checkers on your 13-point.,
Put three checkers on your 8-point.,
Place the five remaining checkers on your 6-point.,
Make sure that none of the checkers are overlapping.",How to Set up a Backgammon Board1," It's important to understand the basics of the backgammon board before you begin to put your checkers on it. Here is what you need to know before you begin to set up your board:The board has 24 narrow triangles called points.
The triangles alternate in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each.
The board’s four quadrants include player one’s home board, player one’s outer board, player two’s home board, and player two’s outer board.
Each player's home board is in the right quadrant closest to the player.
The home boards are opposite each other. The outer boards, located in the left quadrant, are also opposite each other.
The triangles are numbered from 1-24. The 24-point is the point that is further from each player, on the leftmost side of the player's opponent's home board, and the 1-point is the rightmost triangle on the player's home court.
Each player's points are numbered in an opposite way. One player's 24-point is the opponent's 1-point, one player's 23 point is another player's 2-point, and so on.;
, It's easier to set up a backgammon board if each player sets up his or her own checkers. Each player should have a set of checkers that is all one color. Checkers are usually white and brown or black and red, but it really doesn't matter as long as there are two different colors of checkers., Since the game is played in a horseshoe fashion, this point will be the ""furthest"" away from the home board. The 24-point is the closest point to one player on the left side of his board and on the right side for the other player. Keep in mind that as the players set up their checkers, the checkers should always create mirror images of one another., The 13-point will be on the same side of the board as the 24-point, the rightmost point on each player's opponent's side. If you want to be sure that you are putting them in the right spot, count backwards from where you placed the 2 checkers on the 24-point until you reach the 13-point., The 8-point will be on the same side of the board as each player's home board, just two spaces away from the central bar. But again, if you want to be sure that you are placing the checkers in the right place, count backwards from where you placed the checkers on the 13-point until you reach the 8-point. , The six point is right next to the bar for both players but on opposite sides of the board. Count back from the 8-point checkers to be sure that you are placing them in the right spot. These last five checkers will be the only ones that start out in your home board. You can use these checkers to create primes in your home board that may prevent the other player from reentering the board if you hit one of his blots., Remember that each player has his own numbering system, so none of the checkers you just placed should overlap. If one or more points has two different players’ checkers on it, then you have set up the board incorrectly and will need to start over.

There are also slots on the left and right sides of the unit marked with “+” and “-.” These are where you insert a player’s card to add and subtract funds in their account. Make sure that you understand what each symbol represents before you begin playing.


Since you can only view 5 numbers on the display screen, you will need to use the denomination buttons “M” and “K,” which stand for million (M) and thousand (K).
”C” is the clear or cancel button. To restart a game, you will want to use this to adjust the balances on the player cards back to the beginning amount of $15M. You can do this by holding the “C” button until you hear a beep.
The arrow button is used when a player passes “GO.” Insert their card in the left side of the unit and press this button to increase their balance by $2M.

, Auctions are held on properties not bought by the player who lands on them, or returned to the bank after bankruptcy. If a player chooses not to purchase the property they land on at purchase price, and the property is currently not owned, hold an auction to sell it at the price players are willing to pay.The starting price is set by the first player to make an offer.
Issue the title deed to the player who wins the auction.

, Press the arrow symbol to deposit $2 million dollars into their account., Tokens have been updated from the original monopoly board game to reflect the new age of electronic banking.

, Roll to determine who goes first. Every player should roll both dice and add the amount shown on each die to total their roll. The player with the highest total starts the game.


Roll again to determine the number of spaces you move your token on the board.
If you roll a double (the same number on both die), complete your turn and roll again for a second turn. If you roll another double you get another turn. If you roll three doubles in a row, though, you go to jail.

, This space allows you to complete any transactions on your turn, while not owing anything to another player or drawing a card., There are several ways you can be sent to jail. Get out of jail by paying your bond, rolling doubles, or using a “Get out of jail free” card.You can be sent to jail by landing on the “Go to jail” space, drawing a “Go to jail” card from the community chest, or rolling three sets of doubles in a row.

You must sell houses in even numbers the same way they were bought.

, You can receive half go the deed price for the hotel or trade it in for houses equaling the same value.


For instance a hotel can be sold to the bank and you can receive 4 houses from the bank to put on that property.

, You can sell sites, airports and utilities to other players to gain money. The price they pay you is any amount agreed on by both parties.Sites can’t be sold if there are buildings on any of the sites in that color group. You must first sell those properties to the bank.

, Once you have built houses on all of the sites of one color, you can add houses to these site properties.You must continue to build evenly across the sites in that color.
No houses can be built on sites of a color where another house is mortgaged on any other site of the same color.

, Once you have 4 houses on every site of a single color group, you can exchange those houses for a hotel. Return the houses to the banker and pay the title deed price for the hotel you would like to build.Only one hotel is allowed on each property site.

, Once you have sold all of the buildings on a color group, you may choose to mortgage a property for money from the bank.Turn the property card upside down. This symbolizes that it has been mortgaged. The amount of the mortgage is on the back of the card.
You cannot collect rent on a property when it is mortgaged.

, To reinstate your property and begin collecting rent again, you must repay the mortgage to the bank plus interest.Flip the card back over once the mortgage is paid to make the property active again.
The mortgage must be paid plus interest of 10% rounded up to the nearest $10,000.

, Agree on a sale price with another player and sell them your mortgaged property to gain money and get out of paying interest. The interest is now the responsibility of the player who bought the property.The new owner can take over the 10% interest, or pay it right away to get the property out of mortgage status.

, When the money you owe to the bank or another player reaches a higher amount than you have in your own savings and assets, you have officially gone bankrupt and are out of the game.If you owe the bank, the banker take your deeds and auctions any properties you may have had left. Return any “Get out of jail free” cards in your hand to the bottom of the community chest deck.

, Take over the properties and charge the other players until they go bankrupt. The last player left in the game is the winner.

Move in one direction only.,
Place checkers on open points only.,
Try to protect your checkers from your opponent.,
Learn how doubles work.,
Bear off your checkers first to win the game.",How to Set up a Backgammon Board2," Each player rolls two dice during his turn. Each number in the dice roll indicates how many points each checker can move. Each move is separate and the two dice roll numbers should not be added together., Checkers always move in one direction, from the opposing player's home board, crossing the two outer boards, and into the moving player's home board. Checkers can never go backwards, only forward. The movement of the checkers resembles a horseshoe., Checkers can only move to open points on the board. Open points either have no checkers on them, have the player's checkers on them, or have just one of the opponent's checkers on them. A player cannot move his checkers into a point that has two or more of the opponent's checkers on it because that point is temporarily ""claimed"" by the opponent., Players should try to keep their checkers safe from their opponents. To keep your checkers safe, you should try to move them so each point has at least two checkers on it. If you have just one checker on a point, your opponent can land on it and take your checker out of the game (a point with one checker is called a blot). You'll have to start that checker over from the home board., If a player rolls doubles, then he gets to move the number on the dice four separate times. So, if you roll two 3s, you can move any checker 3 spaces 4 separate times. You can also dive the spaces among different checkers., Once a player has all of the checkers in his or her home board, then he can begin to ""remove"" them from the game. This is called ""bearing the checkers off the board."" To bear off checkers, you have to roll the dice to get the points the checkers are on.For example, if you have two checkers on your 5-point, and you roll a 5 and a 3, you can remove one checker completely from the 5-point, and then either move the other checker on the 5-point 3 points over, to the 2-point, or move another checker on the home board. If you don't roll the number of the points the checkers are on, you can move them closer to the 1-point, but you still have to roll a 1 to get them off the board completely.

Consider a game of Dutch backgammon.",How to Set up a Backgammon Board3," To play this variation of the game, each player will place 2 checkers on his 24-point, 2 checkers on his 23-point, 4 checkers on his 13-point, 3 checkers on his 8-point, and 4 checkers on his 6-point. You can think of this as setting up a traditional game of backgammon, except that you ""borrow"" one checker from your 13-point and another from your 6-point. Other than the positioning, the rules are the same as they are for regular backgammon., To set up the board for this game, each player only needs 3 checkers total. Each player should place one checker on his 24-point, 23-point, and 22-point. After that, you're ready to play this exciting and fast-paced version of backgammon. Other than the number and position of the checkers, the regular rules of backgammon apply., For this game, each player places all of his 15 checkers on his 24-point. Other than this unique difference, all other rules of backgammon apply. Since you are placing all of your checkers at the furthermost point from your home board, expect this version to take a bit longer than regular backgammon., The setup for this version of the game is easiest of all! The game begins with all of the checkers off of the board, so you don't have to do a thing. Though the end game is the same -- bearing off your checkers from your home board, the game starts when you have to roll the dice to ""enter"" your checkers into your opponent's home board. In this version, you cannot hit your opponent’s blots until you have at least one of your own checkers in your home board."

Shuffle each stack separately and then place the stacks on their spots on the board. Make sure that the card stacks are facing down., The game goes faster if the money is well-organized in the banker’s tray before you get started. If the money looks a bit messy, take a few minutes to sort it by bill type ($500s, $100s, $50s, $20s, $10s, $5s, and $1s)., If you haven’t already decided who is going to play with you, gather your players now. Monopoly is a great game to play with large and small groups alike because you can have between 2-8 players. It is ideal for players ages 8 and up, but you can always team up younger kids with older kids or adults to make sure that everyone is included., There are eight pieces to choose from in Monopoly: top hat, thimble, shoe, battleship, racecar, Scottie dog, wheelbarrow, and cat.If two players want the same piece and cannot come to an agreement, you can put all of the pieces in a cloth bag and have each player choose a piece at random. Have each player place his or her token on “GO” before you begin the game.

, The banker should be willing to do more than the other players during the game, since he/she will be responsible for handing out money to other players for passing Go and handling property purchases. Make sure that you chose someone who is trustworthy as well because the person who is the banker can cheat more easily than other players.Before starting the game, place all of the properties, houses, hotels, and money near the banker.

, Before you start playing, the banker will need to give each player his or her starting money. Each player gets $1,500 to start the game. The $1,500 should be provided in the following denominations:2 $500s
2 $100s
2 $50s
6 $20s
5 $10s
5 $5s
5 $1s

Monopoly money;
, Unfold the game board and place it on your playing surface, such as a sturdy table or a carpeted floor. Make sure that all players can access the board with ease. Have each player choose a car mover and place it on the “GO!” space on the board., The booths should be the same color as the player's car mover token. If there are 3 or 4 players, each player should get 10 Ticket Booths. If there are only 2 players, each player should get 12 Ticket Booths., The Banker administers the money in the game, keeping it separate from his or her own money as a player.

, Chance cards can be identified by the question mark (?) on the back of each card. Make sure that all of the Chance cards are facing down so that players won’t be able to see what they are before they draw them., Whoever rolls highest number will take the first turn. Play may pass either to the left (clockwise) or to the right (counterclockwise), depending on what you and your fellow players want to do., At the beginning of each turn, you should roll the die and move your car mover that number of spaces. Only roll the die once per turn. Read the instructions for the space that you land on and follow them., If you land on an Amusement that doesn't have a Ticket Booth on it, buy the Amusement for the amount shown on the space and put one of your Ticket Booths on it. You now own that Amusement and can charge other players an entrance fee when they land on that space.Placing your Ticket Booth on the space shows other players that it is your Amusement. The Ticket Booth does not cost extra.

, If you land on an Amusement with another player's Ticket Booth on it, pay the owner the dollar amount shown on the space. If that person has a Ticket Booth on both Amusements of the same color, then you have to pay twice the amount shown., If you land on or pass the Go space on the board, then you may collect $2 from the Bank. Make sure that you collect your $2 right after you land on or pass Go. If you wait until the next turn, then it is too late to collect the money., Landing on a Railroad space earns you another roll of the die. If you land on a Railroad space, then roll the die again and move to the space indicated by the new roll of the die., If you land on the Fireworks or Water Show, then you will need to pay $2 to the ""Loose Change"" space as an entrance fee to see the show. Place your $2 on the “Loose Change” space., If you land on the ""Go to the Rest Rooms"" space, pay $3 to the ""Loose Change"" space and place your car mover token on the ""Rest Rooms"" space. Do not pass Go and do not collect $2. Going to the “Rest Rooms” is the same as going to Jail in the adult version of Monopoly.If you just land on the ""Rest Rooms"" space, then you are ""Just Waiting."" This is like the ""Just Visiting"" section of the Jail space in the adult version of Monopoly.

, If you land on the ""Loose Change"" space, collect any money that is on the space. This rule is like the house rule for using ""Free Parking"" as a jackpot space in the adult version of Monopoly., If you land on Chance, draw the top card from the Chance pile and follow its instructions. Then, place the Chance card face up on the discard pile. Once all the Chance cards have been played, turn the discard pile over and start again. (You may want to shuffle the cards first.), Follow the instructions for the space you land on as if you had landed on it from a roll of the die. If you land on or pass Go, collect $2 from the Bank., Keep your token on its present space, and follow the instructions for placing Ticket Booths. The instructions for placing Ticket Booths include:If either of the Amusements of the color indicated on the card is unoccupied, put your Ticket Booth on that Amusement. If both are unoccupied, choose the Amusement you want to place your Ticket Booth on.
If both Amusements are occupied by Ticket Booths of different colors, replace the Ticket Booth on the Amusement of your choice with your own. Return the displaced Ticket Booth to its owner.
If both Amusements are occupied by Ticket Booths of the same color, they cannot be replaced. Discard the Chance card and draw another, following its instructions.

, When one of the players is out of Monopoly money, the game is over. The player who ran out of money cannot win the game. One of the other players will be the winner., Keep in mind that you only have to have players count their money if you are playing a 3- or 4-player game. If there are only two players, then the player who still has some money wins the game., Once all of the players have counted their money, you can declare a winner. The player who has the most Monopoly money wins the game!"

Roll the house die.,
End your turn whenever you like, just don't go too far or you could roll all 3 policemen, resulting in you losing everything you've earned in that turn!

,
Another way is to get a random marker (anything that is small) and put on the go space.

,
When someone rolls a one it goes forward one space if someone rolls a snake eyes (two ones) it goes forward two spaces.

,
When it goes all the way around the board once the game is over and the person with the most amount of money wins.

,
If you want to play a tad longer, if someone rolls a six, it goes back one space, if someone rolls a jackpot (two sixes) he goes backward two spaces.",How to Play Monopoly Express," The game is for 2-4 players, but you can have more if you like, although it would make the game a bit longer and harder.;
, The default goal is $15,000. The first player to get $15,000 by collecting properties wins the game!


For a shorter game, play for $10,000. For a longer game, you can play for $25,000, or whatever you like.

, Decide who goes first. Play then proceeds to the left. On your turn, here's what you will do:


Set the house die aside. The house die is the one with the pictures of the houses, hotel, lightning-struck house, and get out of jail free. Roll the remaining 10 dice.
Place all police dice in the designated area immediately.

Decide on any ""keepers"". Since the goal of the game is to collect all the properties in that color group, you should probably keep any properties that you have at least two of, in order to complete that group of properties. Once you decide to keep any dice, you must keep those dice the rest of your turn.
Roll again. You can keep rolling as many times as you like to try to get color groups, however, if you roll all 3 police dice, your turn immediately ends and you lose everything you've collected in that turn.
Chance: If you roll a question mark (?), this resembles a wild card and may be placed on any space.

, If you get a monopoly (complete color group), score the amount written on the board for that color group, not the dice. Roll the house die immediately. The house die will show one of the following:



House: Get one of the houses from the bank and collect $1,000. You may keep this house for the rest of the game. If all four houses have already been bought from the bank, you're out of luck!

Lightning-struck house: Give one of your houses back to the bank. You do not lose $1,000.

Get out of jail free: Take away one of your police dice. If you do not have any police dice, then it's no use!

Hotel: If you roll a hotel, you may collect $5,000, only if you own all four houses.

,,,,, If the you roll a six when he's on GO, do not move the marker back. If you roll a jackpot when he's on the space after GO move it back one space.

Decide one player to be the banker.,
Choose a token.,
Start with $1500.,
To decide who goes first, have each player roll the dice.,
Buy property.,
Collect rent.,
Pass GO.,
Take a Chance or Community Chest card.,
Go to jail.,
Get out of jail by doing one of the following:









Pay $50.,
At any time, two players can trade money or property, if both players agree to the trade.








,
Mortgage property.,
Go bankrupt.",How to Play Monopoly," This player shall be in charge of all the money, property, houses and hotels still belonging to the bank. Remember that the chosen banker may also be a player in the game, but he must keep his assets as a player separate from that of the bank's.






;
, Each player will get a mover to represent themselves as they move around the board.








, Each player will begin the game with $1500 divided as follows:

2 $500s,
2 $100s,
2 $50s,
6 $20s,
5 $10s,
5 $5s and
5 $1s.

, Whoever rolls the highest number goes first, and play then continues clockwise around the board.









If you roll doubles, when the two die display the same number, during the game you may move then roll again.

, If you land on a spot with a colored stripe across the top, a railroad or a utility (Electric Company/Water Works), you may buy the property for the amount printed on the board. The banker in turn gives the player the title deed for that property.
If you don't buy the property, it goes to auction. Bidding starts at any amount, and players may bid any amount, as long as they can pay it. The highest bidder pays the bank the amount they bid, and in return, the bank gives the highest bidder the title deed.








, Players who own property may collect rent when another player lands on a property that someone else owns. If you land on someone else's property, you must pay them the rent printed on the title deed card for that property.









Get a Monopoly. If you own all the properties in a colored group, you may charge double the rent for those properties.

Build houses and hotels. If you have a Monopoly, you may start to build houses on any of those properties to charge more rent. (The price to build houses and the extra rent that must be charged are printed on the title deed for that property.) Once you've built four houses on one property, you may replace the four houses with a hotel that you buy to raise even more money when someone lands on that property.
Remember to build evenly. This means that if you build a house on one of the properties in your color group, you must build one house on every property in that color group until you're allowed to buy a second house on any of those properties. You must then make sure to have two houses on all the properties in that group until you are allowed to build a third house on any of those properties.



, Every time a player lands on or passes over the corner space marked ""GO"", they earn a $200 salary.








, These cards may make you pay or collect money, or make you move to another space. If you land on a spot marked ""Chance"" or ""Community Chest"", take the top card off of the corresponding deck of the space that you landed on. When you're done reading the card, return it to the bottom of the corresponding deck.








, There are three possible ways to go to jail:









Roll three doubles in a row - In this case, do not proceed to take your normal turn after rolling a third double in a row - your turn ends immediately and you must go directly to the space marked ""In jail"". Even if you would have passed GO, do not collect $200.
Pick a card that reads ""Go directly to jail"" - If you pick a ""Chance"" or ""Community Chest"" card that reads this, your turn ends immediately and you must go directly to the space marked ""In jail"". Even if you would have passed GO, do not collect $200.
Land on the corner space marked ""Go to jail"" - Move your token directly to the space marked ""In jail"". Even though you pass GO, do not collect $200.

, On your next turn - that is, your next turn after you went to jail, you may pay $50 bail to get out of jail. Now that you're out, on your next turn - that is, your second turn after being sentenced to jail, you may roll the dice and proceed to take a turn.
Roll doubles. If you do not want to pay the $50 bail, you may try to roll doubles to get out of jail. Starting on your next turn - that is, your next turn after you'd been sentenced to jail, you may roll the dice instead of paying the $50. If you fail to roll doubles, you must stay in jail. If you proceed to fail roll doubles for the third time, you must pay $50 immediately after failing to roll doubles the third time - you may then immediately proceed to take your turn, using the roll that was your third fail to get out of jail.
Use a ""Get out of jail free"" card. There is one each of ""Chance"" and one ""Community Chest"" cards marked ""Get out of jail free"". If you pick this card, instead of returning it to the bottom of the deck, you may keep it with you until you get in jail. Once you get in jail, you may choose to use this card to get out of jail, free. To do this, on your next turn - that is, your next turn after you'd been sent to jail, declare that you're using the card and then return it to the bottom of the corresponding deck.

,, If at some stage a person has to pay rent of more money than they own they can mortgage their houses and get the money from the bank. When a house is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. To unmortgage a house you must pay 10% interest when you pay it off.








, If you owe more money than you and your assets can afford, you're declared bankrupt and are out of the game. Last player standing wins!

Decide on a rule for landing on unclaimed properties.,
Add money to Free Parking.,
Receive extra money for landing on “Go.” Receive an extra $50 or $100 in addition to the $200 if you land on Go.,
Add random fees.,
Require players to be honest about rent.",How to Play Monopoly with Alternate Rules1," If you land on an unclaimed space that you can either not afford or choose not to buy, the official rules state that you must have an auction for that property. However, many people either:


Let the person decline purchasing the property without any action.
Ban that person from purchasing that property if they land on it again while it is unclaimed.;
, Pay all fees to the bank (such as from a Chance or Community Chest) to the middle of the board. The next person to land on Free Parking collects the pot in the middle. Add some money (usually $50 or $500) so anyone who lands on Free Parking doesn't leave empty handed.

, You could also collect double money for landing on GO, which would be $400. The amount you receive for landing on Go should be decided before the game starts., Make players pay fees for random offenses. These offenses should be decided before the beginning of the game. The fees could involve dice. For example, if someone makes a sloppy dice roll, then make them pay $50 to the center of the board. If someone rolls the dice off of the table, make them pay $50 or $100. The rules can be made up by the players and be as random as anyone that knocks over a real estate piece has to pay a fine., Typically, real estate owners have to keep an eye on other players to see who lands on their property. If the real estate owner doesn’t catch a player landing on the property, then the player doesn’t have to pay. Play an honest game by requiring everyone to pay rent, even if the real estate owner doesn’t see that the player has landed on the real estate."
"
Allow players to go straight to hotels.,
Make the option of unlimited property.,
Let players have double hotels.,
Form a partnership.,
Make non-monopoly building an option.",How to Play Monopoly with Alternate Rules2," If a player has enough money, allow him or her to buy a hotel immediately. The price of the hotel should be equal to five houses. Even if there are not enough houses left to buy, that will not matter with this alternate rule for players with a lot of money. All that matters is if the player has enough money for five houses.This option will benefit players with a lot of money, but hurt the players with little money.

, In a usual game, a player is only allowed to buy a certain amount of property based on what is left, and once it is gone, the other players do not have the option of buying real estate. Allowing an unlimited amount of houses and hotel gives players who struggled in the beginning a chance to catch up as the game progresses. You can choose to remember how many houses and/or hotels you own, or mark them with a small piece of paper., Alter the rule to allow players to have two hotels on a piece of property. When other players land on that property, they must pay the price of rent for two hotels. It is also an option to have one hotel and build up to another hotel buy having multiple houses on the property.For example, if a property has one hotel and three houses on Boardwalk, then the rent would be $3400.

, Two or more players can form a partnership when they have a monopoly between them. Each player can buy property (houses and hotels) for that property, as long as they follow the rules for building property. Once the partnership is formed, it can be left between dice rolls. If a partner leaves, the other partner is forced to sell his or her portion of the partnership.You can also make it an option for the remaining partner to buy the former partner’s portion of property.

, Allow players to build properties on certain locations, even if they do not own the entire set of properties. This can be an option, but make the cost of property double what it normally is. If the player decides to sell it back to the bank, the player only receives half of what the cost normally is."

Know the important properties.,
Use the rules to your advantage.,
Divide and conquer.,

Make use of your dining companions.,
Dumpster dive and trash pick.,
Ask McDonald's workers for game pieces.,
Ask other diners for their game pieces.,
Be ever vigilant.",How to Increase Your Chances at McDonald's Monopoly Game," Knowing is half the battle, right? Before you set your sights on the million dollar prize, you should know what sort of odds are working against you. The odds of winning the grand prize and finding both Park Place and Boardwalk pieces are 1 in 3.5 billion.


According to mathematical analysis, 89.9% of the prizes will be food prizes, so if you want to win a significant instant prize, like the $1000 prize for brown properties (odds 1 in 30 million), you'll have to collect many game pieces.;
, The overwhelming majority of McDonald's Monopoly game pieces are so frequent that they won't do more than occupy space in your wallet or on your game board. But there are a few rare properties which, if collected, could translate to a significant prize. The rare properties, and the probabilities, for McDonald's 2014 contest are as follows:


Boardwalk #522 (1 in 651,841,628)
Kentucky Avenue #512 (1 in 32,592,082)
Mediterranean Avenue #501 (1 in 651,842)
Pennsylvania Avenue #520 (1 in 325,920,814)
Short Line Railroad #526 (1 in 57,833,265)
Tennessee Avenue #510 (1 in 2,429,970)
Ventnor Avenue #516 (1 in 8,691,222)
Vermont Avenue #504 (1 in 144,583,163)
Virginia Avenue #508 (1 in 130,368,326)
Water Works #527 (1 in 162,960,407), Due to legal considerations, the McDonald's Monopoly game is ""no purchase necessary,"" which means that you don't actually have to buy McDonald's food to receive a winning game piece.As of 2014, players could mail in requests to this address to receive game pieces:
2012 MONOPOLY Game at McDonald's Game Piece Request,
P.O. Box 49121,
Strongsville, OH 44149-0121.


However, this request must be written legibly by hand in a self-addressed, stamped envelope, with proper postage and a return address that includes first and last name, street address, city, state, and ZIP or postal code.Expect to get 2 game pieces after mailing in your request., These odds are a little steep for you to attempt on your own, unless you are a die-hard connoisseur of Mickie D's cuisine. Gather a group a trusted friends, make an agreement on how you will divide whatever prizes you might win, and be sure that everyone in your group knows the valuable properties from the dime-a-dozen.


If you and your friends are serious about collecting McDonald's Monopoly pieces for the sake of winning a significant prize, you might want to consider having a contract drawn up, having each member of your team sign it, and having the contract notarized.

, Know which products contain game pieces and which products contain the most game pieces. A combo meal is a good way of upping the number of game pieces you receive. Adding a shake or an apple pie will net you even more.


For the 2013 Monopoly game, the following items have the most game pieces:

20 piece chicken McNuggets: 4 game pieces
Large fries: 4 game pieces
Medium drink: 2 game pieces
10 piece chicken McNuggets: 2 game pieces
Hash-browns: 2 game pieces
Egg McMuffin: 2 game pieces



, Though you earlier strategizing informed you of the most valuable properties, your dining companions might not be as aware. Play it cool, and if you noticed a friend you are dining with has a rare property, ask at the end of your meal if you can add it to your collection.


This strategy could be construed as unethical, and may lose you a friend. Remember, victory can taste bitter if you have no one to share it with.

, Many customers might not even bother tearing off game pieces to see if it's a winner. You may find a rare game piece in McDonald’s trash cans, dumpsters, or recycle bins. Be respectful of other customers and the requests of staff. You don't want to be banned from a conveniently located McDonald's because you made a mess or disturbed other customers.


Some tips on dumpster diving can be found here.

, That’s right, just walk up to the counter and ask for them. If you have some clever way of asking for them, or perhaps you make it into a joke, you could find yourself a very lucky recipient of some free game pieces.

, If you’re feeling bold enough to do this, you might get lucky. Put a quirky spin on your request, like holding out your ball cap and saying, ""Collecting game pieces for the poor!""

, Hawk-eye the McDonald’s parking lot, the restaurant floor, the condiment bar, and tables for extra game pieces. A forgetful customer might be the determining factor in you winning your cash prize!

Keep playing until someone wins.",How to Play Monoply Empire," Before you start setting up your game of Monopoly Empire, you may want to check the game components to ensure that you have everything. Checking the game components will also help you to become more familiar with the game pieces and board. You should have:a Monopoly Empire board
4 Towers
6 game tokens
30 Billboard tiles
6 Office tiles
14 Chance cards
14 Empire cards
Monopoly money
2 dice;
, After you have checked your game components to make sure that you have everything you need to play, you can set up your game board. Unfold the board and place it on a table, the floor, or wherever you plan to play the game.Make sure that you place the board somewhere that all of the players have easy access to the board.

, Shuffle the deck of Chance cards and the deck of Empire cards and place them in their designated spots on the board. The Chance cards are similar to the Chance cards used in regular Monopoly. The Empire cards are similar to the Community Chest cards in Monopoly, which often give you advantages that may help you win the game.You will get two Empire cards at the beginning of the game.

, The brand billboard tiles have specific places all around the game board. Look for these spaces and match the billboard tile to the billboard space. For example, the Coca-Cola billboard tile should go on the Coca-Cola billboard space. You will be competing against your fellow players to obtain these tiles and fill up your tower first., The Water Works and Electric Company tiles have a specific spaces on the board where you should place those tiles until someone purchases them. There is one space for all four of the Water Works tiles and one space for all four of the Electric Company tiles., The only tiles that you do not place on the board are the six office tiles. Leave these tiles off of the board along with the dice. You can put them off to the side or have someone be in charge of them., The banker is in charge of handling transactions, managing auctions, giving players money when they pass “GO,” and collecting fees and fines. Make sure that the person you choose to be the banker is willing and able to perform all of these tasks.Have the banker give everyone $1000 to start the game (one $500, four $100s, and two $50s).

, Everyone starts the game with two Empire cards. Look at them, but don’t share them you’re your fellow players. Wait until your turn to use them. Each player will also need a tower. The object of the game is to be the first one to fill up your tower with billboards., The game tokens in Monopoly Empire include a game controller, racecar, coke bottle, film slate, motorcycle, and French fries. , In Monopoly Empire, the first player to fill up his or her billboard with brand billboards wins the game. Therefore, you want to buy as many brand billboards as quickly as you can to fill up the spaces in your board. When other players land on billboard spaces that you own, they will have to pay you the amount of money you’re your billboard height reaches on your tower.If a player runs out of money, they do not go bankrupt as in regular Monopoly. That player simply takes the top billboard piece from his or her tower and gives it to the player who requires it., Before you start the game, decide who will go first. The official rules for Monopoly Empire state that the youngest player gets to go first. If you prefer, you can also determine who goes first by rolling the dice and seeing who gets the largest number. Follow a clockwise pattern for turns., When it is your turn to play, you will need to complete a specific set of actions. Perform these actions on every turn in the same order. Your turn will be a little different every time based on the space you land on. During your turn, perform each of the following actions:Roll the dice. Take two turns if you roll a double. For example, if you roll two sixes, then move 12 spaces and perform an action for that space. But then, roll again and move again and perform another action.
Move your token the number of spaces you rolled. For example, if you roll a 10, then move 10 spaces
Perform an action for the space you land on. For example, if you land on a billboard tile that is available for purchase, then you can purchase it.

, Whenever you land on a Chance or Empire card space, you will get to draw one of these cards. In general, you will need to use Chance cards right away, but you can save Empire cards until you want or need to use them.For example, if you get a “Get Out of Jail Free” card, then you can hang onto it until you need it.

, If you happen to land on a billboard that you do not want to buy, then that tile will be up for auction. The banker is in charge of managing the auction and the bidding starts at $50. All follow-up bids must be in increments of $50, such as $100, $150, $200, $250, etc. The highest bidder gets the billboard and must pay the amount that he or she bid to the bank., If you roll the handshake icon on one of your dice rolls, then you can perform a sneaky swap as one of your turn actions. This means that you can exchange two topmost billboard tower tiles. For example, you can exchange your topmost billboard tile with another player’s topmost billboard tile, or you can swap the tiles of two other players.Using the sneaky swap is optional. If you do not want to use it, just move your piece the number of spaces that that you rolled on the other die. If you do use the sneaky swap, then do not move this turn.

, The player who fills his or her tower first wins the game. Keep playing until someone does so. Monopoly Empire takes about 90 minutes to play, but it may take longer for someone to win the game."

Be careful not to be too specific. If you're theme isn't broad enough, you might not have enough options to fill out all of the railroad spaces or Community Chest cards without compromising the overall theme.
Pick a name for your game based on the Monopoly formula, like ""Dog-opoly"" or ""Elvis-opoly."";
, For example, if you were making a medieval time period board, you could use a calligraphy script for the spaces and a dungeon instead of the traditional jail cell bars. You'll need four diamond-shaped spaces in the four corners and measure out nine rectangular spaces in between for the property spaces.

, Make a list of different landmarks or places that can be bought and sold. You can be whimsical or logical, like picking ice cream flavors or skyscrapers that exist in New York City. For a San Francisco themed game, you'll want to pick popular places such as Lombard Street or Embarcadero Street, or Ghirardelli Square and Fisherman's Wharf. In total there are 22 property spaces.


You will need to pick eight different colors for each of the groupings.

, After the property spaces, you'll need four railroads, three Chance spots, three Community Chest spaces, and three utility spaces with their monetary values. Additionally, remember to customize the 'Start' space as well as the other corner spots.


Make a ""Go to Jail"" space and a ""Jail"" Space. Be creative with how you want your fellow players to be ensnared. If you're making a jungle-themed game, you can make a space for a ""broken swinging vine"" that sends you to the ""quicksand pit.""

, If this is a gift for someone's anniversary for instance, you can Photoshop or paste actual photos of the couple around your customized Monopoly name.

, Since you've already changed the board you have the option to personalize the game play as well. For example, you can rearrange the property spaces to make it more difficult or alter how long someone remains in jail. But if you don't want to lose too much of the original game, you can print out a copy online or use an old version's copy to keep in the board box.

, The easiest option is to reuse an old Monopoly board for a reference of the layout. You can place your design directly on top of the old board and copy the dimensions for playing spaces. There's no need to cut or measure, you can trace over the lines and markings to finish your game.


If you don't have a Monopoly board nearby, you can find images online of the classic design. There are also many people who have uploaded their own personalized Monopoly games and templates onto fan sites which you can use for inspiration., If not using an old board, you will need any material that can be easily sized to 18x18"" and folded for storage, such as card stock, cardboard, or a weighted paper. The normal Monopoly board is slightly smaller than 18"" but the extra length will give you more space for customizing.


Whatever size you make your board, make sure you have a box or storage container that will fit it. Whether you choose to fold your board or leave it open,make sure that you pick a storage container that fits.

, You can either draw out the playing areas of the board with art supplies or digitally with computer programs. Both give you freedom to play with colors and images, but handmade may be easiest if you aren't as familiar with digital programming. The main choice you have is if you want a handmade feel to the game or a polished, computerized replica.


A ruler or straightedge is going to be your best friend. Measure out the playing spaces and the spaces for the Community Chest and Chance cards so that they are even and consistent.

, You can download a template and tweak the design in Photoshop or create a board design from scratch using a drawing program or website.There are free online programs such as Google Draw that you can use instead of buying a program.
Since the board size is bigger than a normal printer's capacity, you may need to split the image in your editing program to print out over several sheets of paper.With a computer you can also mimic the traditional Monopoly fonts.

, Then, you can lay the sticker over an old board or the one you created. Make sure to smooth out any bubbles as soon as possible. You can use a printed sticker or paper to cover the old game. Use a razor blade to cut a slit through the covering so it can fold into itself for storage.

, Both cards need 16 cards in each deck. Keep the cards' actions the same but customize the text to fit your theme.


For example, instead of the card that says ""Advance to Pall Mall"", you could write ""Advance to Disney World"" if your game is based off of Florida.
For Community Chest cards, you could change ""Pay School Fees"" to ""Pay for Beach Parking.""
Card stock can be cut into any shape or size and works best with most markers, pens, pencils, and paint if you're going the handmade route.

, For simplicity, use the same rent and mortgage amounts as the corresponding original cards. Don't forget to make sure that you coordinate handwritten on the back of the cards or added as a small printed office label sticker.You can also print directly onto card stock if you're using a template in Photoshop or Microsoft Word.For all of your cards, laminate them for longevity and better protection against infamous Monopoly feuds., You can either buy generic or replacement Monopoly money at a game store or online or create your own. If you don't buy replacement money you can draw or print it as well.


Be creative with the denomination designs. For example, if you're doing a game based on Quentin Tarantino movies, you could photoshop his character's faces onto the money and add fake blood splatter for a fun effect.
You can also name your bills and include it on the dollars themselves. ""Credits"" work for video game based Monopolies and ""Bison Bucks"" for a Wild West themed game.

, Traditionally there is anywhere from two to eight players in a single game. Every player needs a token so plan to make about eight or more tokens if you want to change the rules to include more players. You can reuse the old classic Monopoly tokens or design your own. Use your imagination; if you're making a game that's movie-themed, you could make a tiny popcorn token, movie reel, Hollywood star, or an award statue token.

, Sculpting clay or paper maché are easy materials to use to make miniature tokens. You can also use pre-existing items from around your house or any toy and game store. For example, if you're making a superhero themed game, you can use action figures for tokens.


Try to use small items as the spaces on the board are not very large.
Fimo or Sculpey are two reliable and easy-to-find materials for making your own tokens.
Don't forget that you need dice as well. If you aren't going to buy or use your own, you can make a die while sculpting your other tokens.

, Pick something creative but easy to recreate several times since you're going to need 32 houses and 16 hotels total to accommodate for game play. For example, if you're making a Texas-themed game, you can make the pieces look like the Alamo and an oil rig.


You could always repaint old Monopoly houses and hotels different colors to match the rest of your game's color scheme.
You can make the game more complicated by making houses and hotels of different values. For example, you could construct a regular-looking home, a skyscraper, and a castle in the same game and make each of their rent payments incrementally more expensive.

Choose an “Angel of Death.” Put strips of paper into a hat and draw a star on only one of the slips.,
Alter railway rules.,
Allow unlimited doubles.,
Play a game with hostile takeovers.,
Play a shorter game.",How to Play Monopoly with Alternate Rules3," The player that draws the star will be the “Angel of Death.” This player should reveal that they are the Angel of Death. After two hours, this person has the option of ending the game without a winner at any time. The Angel of Death, however, must still be in the game to end it., If you own more than one railway, and you land on one of your own railways, you may ""take a train"" to another one of your railroads on your next move instead of rolling the dice. If another player lands on one of your railways, they may travel to another of your railroads in the same way by paying an agreed upon ""ticket fare"" in addition to the regular rent., Typically, three consecutive doubles will land a player in Jail. It is an option to allow a player to roll unlimited doubles with no consequences. This is great for the lucky player that rolls more than three consecutive doubles, but may get frustrating for the rest of the players., If a player offers to pay 'N' times the face value of a property (Value of N is decided before starting the game) which is owned by another player, who doesn't want to sell it, then the fate of the proposed trade is decided by rolling the dice by both players involved (Aggressive Buyer & Noncommittal Seller). Whoever score highest wins his side of the trade. Hostile bids have to be either on single properties, or if the property is developed then the face value should include the development face value. If the seller owns a pack of single color of properties, the bid has to be for N times the face value of pack (pack cannot be broken by hostile takeover).


Only two hostile bids are allowed between two players before the buyer completes one round around the board. Only one bid per property per player per round. The seller has to pay 30% of the trade value to the bank as tax (this also prevents immediate reverse hostile take over)

, Games of Monopoly can be played for hours at a time with seemingly no end in sight. It is, however, possible to play a shorter game that will only last an hour to and hour and a half. To make the game shorter (use a slightly different set of rules:


Pass out two or three free properties from the bank to each player at the beginning of the game.
Only three houses are required before building a hotel instead of four.
Always get out of jail on your first turn, whether you use a get out of jail free card, roll doubles, or pay $50.
Always pay a flat $200 when landing on Income Tax.
End the game when one person goes bankrupt. All players must add up their properties and houses/hotels at purchase price, their cash, and their mortgaged properties half of the purchase price. The winner is the player with the highest total value.

Conquer continents wisely.,
Pay attention to the army bonus that you get for each continent.,
Attack with the right amount of armies.,
Determine how many armies to keep on each territory.",How to Win at the Game Risk1," While it is good to try to conquer continents early in the game, you should be careful about which continents you decide to conquer. There are advantages and disadvantages to each continent, but the main thing to consider is the isolation of a continent. More isolated continents may be easier to maintain, but they are also more difficult to expand from. Therefore, you should choose a continent that is in line with your strategy.For example, Australia is easy to conquer and maintain because of how isolated it is, but it is also hard to expand from Australia and you may fall prey to more powerful plays later in the game. For these reasons, conquering Australia may offer you an advantage, but only if you feel capable of overcoming its disadvantage.;
, Some continents are much more beneficial to hold than others because you will get a better army bonus each turn. Before you begin trying to conquer a continent, find out how many armies you will get as a bonus for holding that continent. For example, Europe gives you a bonus of 5 armies per turn for holding the continent, while Africa gives you a bonus of 3 armies per turn.Keep in mind that Europe and North America are the most beneficial continents to hold because they give you the best army bonuses. Try to hold one of these continents if you can.

, Knowing how many armies to use in an attack on an opponent can be a big boost to your chances of winning. A good general rule in attacking an enemy territory is to use twice as many armies as your opponent has on the territory you want to attack. This will increase your chances of winning and overtaking the territory. Keep in mind that you will need to move these armies to an adjacent territory before you begin your attack.For example, if an opponent has two armies on a territory that you want, then you should attack that territory with at least four armies.

, In most cases, you will benefit from having most of your armies on your border territories. Concentrating your armies in this way helps to reduce the chances that you will have a weak spot and be overtaken by an opponent. The territories within your borders can have fewer armies, but try to avoid having a single weak spot that an opponent may try to target."
"
Learn about the most common dice rolls.,

Consider staying in jail later in the game.,
Finish off struggling players.,
Gang up on strong players.",How to Win at Monopoly," While you probably don't need to get into blackjack territory, statistically speaking, it's good to learn a little bit about your probability of landing on particular spaces, rolling particular numbers, and the likelihood of landing on a given property.


With the most possibilities of dice combinations, 7 is the most common roll on any given turn, and 2 and 12 are the least probable.Most of the time, it takes 5 or 6 dice rolls to circle the board once. Because 28 of the 40 spaces are property spaces, you will likely land on four of those 28 property spaces.
You've got a 17% chance of rolling doubles on any given roll. You will likely roll a pair of doubles one out of every six rolls. During the average circuit around the board, you will maybe roll doubles once.;
, Mediterranean Avenue and Baltic Avenue are the least-landed-upon properties, while the orange properties (St. James Place, NY Avenue, and Tennessee Ave.) are the most, due to their proximity to Jail, making them the most lucrative monopoly in the game. Acquiring the orange monopoly gives you a very high probability of winning.The single square most landed-upon in the game is Jail, while the single property most landed-upon is Illinois Ave, followed by the B&O Railroad. A hotel on Illinois gives you the most income for a single space, after a hotel on Boardwalk.

, It is a good idea to keep track of the cards that you and your opponents play during the game so you can anticipate what you might draw if you land on a Chance or Community Chest space. Spend some time with the cards before you play to learn what sorts of outcomes might be thrust upon you. Each standard monopoly set includes:Sixteen Chance cards. The odds are high that a chance card will move you to another place, since ten out of sixteen chance cards require you to do so. Additionally, there are two rewards cards which give you money, two penalty cards which take money away, a card that takes away money from building owners and one get out of jail free card.

Sixteen Community Chest cards. The majority of the Community Chest cards, nine out of sixteen, give you money. Three Community Chest cards take money away. Of the remaining cards, two move you elsewhere on the board, one takes away money from building owners and one is a get out of jail free card.

, While some players like to play a kind of custom version of Monopoly, changing certain rules gives you less control over the outcome of the game and can prolong it as well. Play the traditional Parker Brothers rules for the game to give yourself the best possibility of winning.For example, don't make ""Free Parking"" a bonus square and don't make immunity part of any trade.

, The more property you have, and the more rent you collect, the more money you get from your opponents. Buying as many properties as you can early in the game gives you the best chance of winning the game.Don't wait until you've got more money, or until you've landed on Boardwalk or other prestigious properties to start spending money. Start buying whatever open property you land on as soon as possible. The more you own, the better your standing in the game. There's little incentive in Monopoly to play conservatively and wait.You'll start making money after you have property, not before. Don't worry about spending all of your money in the early turns. That just means you're playing smart.

, Don't leave a bunch of open spaces in a color group for others to buy. Buy them yourself if you can. In general, you should always buy unowned properties if no other player owns property in that color group, especially if it gives you a second or third property in a given group, building you closer to a monopoly. The orange properties, in particular, are the most landed-upon, making them the most desirable monopoly.You have a monopoly when you own all of the properties of one color. The holder of a monopoly is entitled to double the rental rate normally paid. The monopoly holder is also entitled to add houses/hotels (which substantially increases rental rates). Holding a monopoly also greatly enhances your bargaining power during property trades made at later times in the game.

, It can also be advantageous to purchase properties to block other players from creating monopolies, opening you up for trade possibilities later in the game. If you see an opponent working towards a particular monopoly, take any opportunity that you get to buy the properties they want.


Don't worry about blocking a monopoly when two players each own a property of a group. They're already blocking each other, meaning you'd be better off placing your attention elsewhere.
Use the advantage that you gain from buying a property that another player wants to get something that you want. For example, if the other player has a property (or two) that you want, propose a trade., In general, the railroad spaces are more valuable than the utility spaces, which offer little in the way of long-term investment. Railroads, though, are only valuable if you own all of them. Some players make acquiring all the Railroads a priority, while some prefer ignoring it as a distraction. Whatever you choose to do, stick with your policy.


There's only a 1 in 38 chance of profiting from a Utilities purchase, meaning you would be better off investing in hotels and other building projects because they will make you more money.Sometimes it might be a good idea to purchase a Railroad to keep another player from having a railroad monopoly.

, As soon as you get a monopoly, start building, and don't stop building until you've got three houses on each property. You will make far more money after you get up to three houses per property. This extra income will increase your chances of winning the game.Build houses when you have enough cash for a ""high probability"" expense such as rents on railroads and utilities, luxury tax and certain Community Chest cards. If possible, wait until you pass the part of the board where there is the highest likelihood of paying the highest penalties, the last few squares of the game before Go.

, When you have only three or four low-rent color groups, you should put three or four houses on each property to restrict the availability of houses to owners of high rent color groups. Don't move up to a hotel if returning houses to the bank would enable your opponent to develop an expensive color group. It's devious, and effective., Mortgaging allows you to raise capital at crucial points in the game. However, keep in mind that it will cost more to lift the mortgages on one of your properties than the total amount raised from mortgaging it in the first place, so don’t bother.Keep in mind the following when mortgaging your property:


Single properties should be mortgaged first. Don't mortgage a property from a group where you own 2 or more properties unless it's absolutely necessary.
If you need to raise money, mortgage single properties if it allows you to own a color group of at least three houses per property (or hotels in the Light Blues or Purple group).
As you cannot collect rent once a property is mortgaged, try not to mortgage those properties that players land on frequently or get higher-than-average rents from landers.

, Pay attention to your fellow players' preferences for particular properties and try to use that knowledge to your advantage. Trying to trade for a full line of colored properties is good, as it allows for building expansions. However, you want to avoid trading down for these color sets. For example, while gaining all of the pink properties in a trade may be good, it may not be wise if the trade enables another player to own all of the orange properties. You will likely pay more in rent to the owner of the orange properties.


Before you make a deal, decide whether or not it will be advantageous to you in the future. Always ask yourself, what will this do for me in the long run, and how will this trade help me bankrupt my opponents?
A good rule of thumb is to only trade to give yourself a monopoly, or to give yourself more monopoly than your opponent., In Monopoly, unlike in real life, being in jail is not always a bad thing. Early in the game, before you have a monopoly, you should pay the $50 to get out of jail so you can continue purchasing properties. However, later in the game, if most of the properties are owned or if most of the properties between the Jail and Go to Jail spaces are developed, simply roll the dice and stay in jail until you roll the required number to get out. This can be a welcome alternative to paying rent for landing on other players’ properties., Monopoly has a reputation for often dragging out into games that last several hours or several days, but it doesn't necessarily need to be so. As soon as most of the property has been bought up, it's a good idea to start the bargaining process, and attempt to convince players in less advantageous positions to forfeit their properties and concede the game. Put those properties back into play and open the game back up to the players in better position to win.If a player is blocking monopolies and is unwilling to trade properties, consider calling it a draw and starting a new game. In this situation, you could spend days trading money back and forth without making much progress.

, Does your dad always win? Before the game, form an alliance with the other players and make a plan to mess up his operations. Form a united front to block his monopolies and prevent him from gaining an advantage. Keeping a strong player from gaining an advantage will work in your favor.

Create allies.",How to Play Risk," The objective of the game is to conquer the world by controlling all of the countries on the board. You do this by attacking other players and taking over new territories on the board. All the while, you need to make sure that your own territories are well-defended., Before you start your game, make sure that you have all of the game components. The game of Risk comes with a foldable game board, a set of 72 cards, and various army tokens.The Risk board has 6 continents — North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Australian Archipelago — and 42 countries.
The Risk armies come in six basic colors, along with different kinds of tokens, denoting size of the army. Each set has Infantry (which represents 1 “army”), Cavalry (5 armies), and Artillery (10 armies).
A pack of 56 Risk cards should be included. 42 cards are marked with countries as well as an infantry, cavalry, or artillery symbol. There are two ""Wild"" cards, and 12 ""Mission"" cards that come with the Secret Mission Risk variant. There should be five dice (three red and two white).

, Before you get started, figure out how many people will be playing the game. The total amount of armies you start the game with depends on how many players there are:6 players - 20 armies each
5 players - 25 armies each
4 players - 30 armies each
3 players - 35 armies each
2 players - 40 armies each (this varies between editions)

, This will determine the starting points for all players. Each territory must have one “army” in it at all times. There are two ways to determine the initial territories:Have each player roll a die (Standard Rules). The player that rolled the highest value will choose an open territory and place one soldier in it. Moving clock-wise, each player will select an open territory until all territories are occupied. Once players have claimed all the 42 territories on the board, players place their remaining armies onto territories they already claim in any order they choose.
Deal out the deck of cards (Alternate Rules). Deal out the entire deck of cards, minus the two Wild cards. Have each player place one of their army pieces in each territory according to the cards they are holding. Take turns doing this.

, The player who rolls the highest number starts the game. Then the play order goes clockwise from the starting player. The game starts after the order of play has been determined., Each player can redeem his armies in whatever unit s/he wants (infantry, cavalry, or artillery), provided they all add up to the same number of armies. So if a player gets seven armies at the beginning of his turn, he can redeem them by getting either seven infantry pieces or by getting one cavalry piece and two infantry pieces (which add up to seven)., At the beginning of each turn, players receive more armies. The number of armies is determined by:The number of territories you own. For every three countries, the player gets one army. For example, if you had 11 countries, you would receive 3 armies; if you had 22 countries, you would receive 7 armies.
Turning in cards. Cards can be turned in when you have a three of a kind (e.g. all three cards have artillery pictures) or all three types of armies (soldier, cavalry, artillery). For the first set of cards you turn in, you receive 4 armies; 6 for the second; 8 for the third; 10 for the fourth; 12 for the fifth; 15 for the sixth; and for every additional set thereafter, 5 more armies than the previous set turned in. If you have 5 or more Risk cards at the beginning of a turn, you must turn at least one set of them in.
Owning all the territories of a continent. For each continent that you completely dominate (no other enemy armies are present), you receive reinforcements. You receive 3 armies for Africa, 7 armies for Asia, 2 armies for Australia, 5 armies for Europe, 5 armies for North America and 2 armies for South America.

Note: if the amount of armies you would receive at the beginning of your turn is less than three, round up to three.

, You may place the armies you received at the beginning of your turn wherever you have an army presence, in whatever proportion. If you wish, you can place one army in each of your territories; or you can place all of your armies in one territory. The choice is up to you.If, during the beginning of your turn, you turned in a set of cards with a territory that you owned, you receive two extra infantrymen. You must place those infantrymen on the territory specified by the card.


, You may only attack other territories that are adjacent to a territory you own or that are connected to a territory you own by a sea-lane. For example, you cannot attack India from the Eastern United States because the territories are not adjacent., You may attack the same territory more than once, or you may attack different territories. You can attack the same territory from the same adjacent position, or you can attack it from different adjacent positions.Understand that attacking is optional. A player may decide not to attack at all during a turn, only deploying armies.

, When you want to attack another territory, you have to declare your intentions out loud. For example, you could say ""I'm attacking Eastern United States from Western United States."", Because your territory must be occupied at all times, you must leave at least one army behind. The number of armies you attack with will determine how many dice you get to roll when you square off the opponent whose territory you are defending.1 army = 1 die
2 armies = 2 dice
3 armies = 3 dice

, You roll up to three red dice, depending on your troop size. The defending player rolls the same number of white dice as the number of troops in their defending territory, with a maximum of two.Match up the highest red die with the highest white die, and match the second highest red die with the second highest white die. If there is only one white die, only match up the highest red die with the white die.Remove one of your pieces from the attacking territory if the white die is higher or equal to its corresponding red die.
Remove one of your opponent’s pieces from the defending territory if the red die is higher to its corresponding white die.

, If you successfully wipe out all of the defending armies in the area you are attacking, then will need to occupy the territory with at least as many attacking armies as used in the attack. If you attack with three dice (or three armies), you must colonize the newly-acquired territory with at least three armies, although you can choose to colonize it with more if you wish., If at the end of your attacking turn you've conquered at least one territory, then you have earned a Risk card. You cannot earn more than one Risk card for this. The goal is to collect sets of three “Risk” cards to exchange them for new armies.If you manage to wipe out an opponent by destroying his or her last army, you gain possession of all the Risk cards he or she may have had in their hands.

, If you territories are not well fortified, then they will be vulnerable to attack from your opponents. To keep your territories safe from attack during your opponents' attack phases, move your pieces where you want them before ending your turn., Move your pieces to different territories at the end of your turn. It is in your best interest to move pieces to your border territories that are more vulnerable to attacks by your opponents. There are two rules on how you can move your pieces:Standard Rule: Move any number of army pieces from a single territory into an adjacent territory occupied by you.

Alternate Rule: You can move pieces anywhere, as long as the starting point and destination can be reached by going through a string of adjacent territories under your control.

, In order to retain control of the territories that you are moving army pieces from, make sure that you leave at least one of your army pieces on each territory that you own. Otherwise, you will no longer have control of the territory., Risk is a strategy game, so it rewards players who employ tactics and who outsmart their opponents. The three pieces of strategic advice given to players by the Risk rulebook include:Try to hold entire continents to get the bonus reinforcements. Your might is measured in army reinforcements, so it's a good strategy to get as many reinforcements as possible.
Watch your borders for buildups of enemy armies that could imply an impending attack.
Make sure your own borders are properly fortified against enemy attack. Cluster your reinforcements mostly along your borders to make it harder for enemies to penetrate your territory.

, One way to improve your chances of winning is to go on the offensive right away and attack your opponents every chance that you get. This strategy will help you to gain more territories quickly, which will give you more armies to work with at the beginning of your turns. Attacking often will also take armies away from your opponents, so they will have fewer armies to work with., Eliminating weak opponents with plenty of Risk cards has two benefits: it gets rid of an enemy as well as netting you extra cards. Pay attention to your opponents’ cards in hand as well as their potential weaknesses to determine if there is anyone you can take out during the game.

, Players who regularly play Risk know that certain continents can be more advantageous to seize control of than other continents. For example, conquering small continents is an advantage because they have fewer territories and are easier to control.Other strategies around continents include:


Australia Theory. Start in Australia and hold control of it. This will give you two extra reinforcements per turn, and it can only be accessed by one territory. Build troops and move up through Asia when it begins to weaken.
North America Theory. Begin in North America, fortify it against Europe and Asia. Move down to South America, cut through Africa and move up. This operates on the assumption that Asia and Europe are fighting each other to expand.
Africa Theory. Begin in Africa, then fortify it against Europe and South America. Move left to South America, cut through North America and move to Asia through Alaska. This operates on the assumption that Asia, North America and Europe are fighting each other to expand.
Try not to begin in Asia; it has too many borders to fortify and will quickly lead to over-expansion and spreading your troops thin.

, Instead of attacking as much as you can, you might choose to defend your borders and build up your troops. While you will not receive the continent bonus of armies at the beginning of your turn, having strong defenses will make it harder for your opponents to attack you and win., While this isn't outlined as a ""rule"" in the official book, you may benefit from creating agreements with players to help each other and take out other players. Just keep in mind that you will eventually need to attack each other. A sample agreement might be something like, ""Neither of us will expand into Africa until Alexander is out of the game."" This will make it easier to concentrate your efforts on other objectives.

, When you have completed the event registration form, you will need to send it to Hasbro along with all of the required supplementary materials. Double check the event registration form before you send your packet to make sure that you have provided the correct information., It can take up to four weeks for Hasbro to send you a letter granting or denying your request to hold an official Monopoly tournament, so send your forms in as soon as possible. When you get your approval letter, you can start preparing for your event., Start preparing everything that you will need for the tournament well in advance of the tournament. Putting together a Monopoly tournament is a lot of work and it takes time. You should allow yourself a few months to get everything ready., Make a list of questions to determine what you need to do to get ready for the tournament. For example, you will need to know where you will hold the tournament, how many participants you will have, how many Monopoly games you will need, how many tables and chairs you will need, what types of refreshments you will provide, how you will raise money at the event, and so on.Write down everything that you need to figure out to help yourself stay organized.
If you are organizing this event with other people, you may want to hold a planning meeting to figure everything out. Doing so will help you to keep track of what is taken care of and what still needs to be done.

, The best place to do this is indoors, in a gym, cafeteria, school, or popular local gathering such as an indoor pavilion. Make sure your location has:enough room to hold your participants, volunteers, and spectators.
good ventilation and emergency exits.

, You will need lots of things to run an official Monopoly tournament, so start getting things together as soon as possible. For example, you will need to have enough chairs and tables for your participants. You will also need to have enough Monopoly games for all of the participants.Make a list of everything that you will need to gather before the event and check it often to see how you are doing.

, There are several ways to raise money at a Monopoly tournament. You can require participants to pay an entry fee to participate in the tournament, you can ask businesses in your community to contribute a set amount of money or to provide services at the event, or you can request attendees to make a donation.Try using a combination of fundraising techniques to raise as much money for your cause as possible.

, Hasbro has to approve all promotional materials for an official Monopoly tournament. That means that you can use any of the promotional materials that you included in your event registration packet, but nothing else unless you also get those materials approved by Hasbro., You will need to g some volunteers to serve as refs, bankers, and head judges. At your tournament, each game will always need a judge or referee, and banker present. In an official Monopoly tournament, the banker may not play the game in addition to acting as the banker.Make sure that you hold a meeting prior to the event to explain the tournament rules and procedures to all of your volunteers.

, Before people are allowed into the tournament, you and your volunteers should get everything set up and ready to go. You will need to prepare the tables, chairs, games, refreshments, judges’ table, and anything else that you will require to host your tournament., As participants arrive, you should have them check in with your volunteers to make sure that everyone is registered. You should also provide name tags for all of your participants., Before the tournament begins, you should have one of your volunteers review the official Monopoly rules for the participants. Most of your participants will be familiar with the rules already, but reading them out loud will help to head-off some potential disputes over rules and act as a nice refresher for the participants as well., A Monopoly tournament should have at least two 90 minute rounds. The last round should include six participants playing the same game. This last game will determine the winner of the tournament., It is important to let players know how much time is left in each round. Therefore, you should plan to announce the time remaining every 30 minutes and then again when there are 15 minutes left in the round., Players and spectators will be interested to know who won the last game. After the last game has ended and your judges have determined the results of the last game, you can announce the winners and award their prizes.Make sure that you thank all of the tournament participants and let them know how much money was raised for your non-profit organization.

, Hasbro requires tournament organizers to send a tournament results form to them along with some details about the winner and his or her picture. Complete this form right after the tournament and send it to Hasbro as soon as possible.Make sure that you snap a photo of your winner before he or she departs from the tournament.

Decide what you want your tournament to be like.,
Invite players.,
Gather materials.,
Review the rules.,
Figure out how you will run your tournament.,
Set up for your 'tournament'.,
Split the players into equal groups.,
Play two 90-minute games.,
Have the players add up their scores.,
Hold the final round.,
Announce the winners.",How to Have a Casual Monopoly Tournament," To prepare for a causal Monopoly tournament in your home, you will need to work out some details. Think about why you want to have a tournament, who you will invite, how many games you will play, and if you will give away prizes to the winners.For example, you might be thinking of having a casual Monopoly tournament as a birthday party theme or as part of a dinner party.;
, It's definitely best to have at least four players for a causal Monopoly tournament, but the more the better! Send out invites or just tell your friends about the tournament. Let them know when, where, and what (if anything) they should bring.


For example, you could save yourself from having to buy multiple Monopoly sets by asking a few of your friends to bring their sets to the tournament. You could also ask everyone to bring a dish to share to save yourself from having to buy a ton of food.

, Putting on a Monopoly tournament, even if it is a casual one, requires lots of different things. You will need Monopoly games, enough tables and chairs for all of your players, refreshments and snacks, pen and paper for keeping score, and prizes for your winners.Make a list of everything that you will need for your casual tournament and check items off of your list as you get them.

, In 2008, Hasbro made some changes to the game, such as increasing the Luxury Tax from $75 to $100, the dark purple properties are now brown, and more. Make sure you're familiar with the game and the detailed rules., Even if you are having a casual tournament, you will need to decide how it is going to work. Do you plan to just let everyone play at their own pace and give out prizes for the players with the most assets at the end of each game, or do you plan to have two timed 90 minute games similar to an official tournament?Decide how many games you want to have at your tournament and how long each game will be.

, Get everything almost ready to go before your guests arrive. Set up your tables and chairs, put the Monopoly games on the tables, and put out the food and refreshments. Greet your guests as they arrive and invite them to have something to eat/drink and find a seat.

, A Monopoly tournament works best if all of the teams have the same amount of players on them. For example, if there are 12 players in total, then you could split them up into three groups of four. This will ensure a more even playing field for all of your guests., If you are playing by tournament rules, then you will want to have two 90-minute games. Announce the time remaining every 30 minutes and again when only 15 minutes remain. You may also want to have a brief intermission between games to allow players to get something to eat and/or drink before the next game begins., After the second game is over, each of the players should add up their scores from the first game and the second game to get one grand total. The player from each 'group' or 'table' with the most total assets in the end advances to the final round.

, After the first two rounds are over, you will need to have the final round to determine the winners. That means that if you started with 12 contestants and split them up into three groups of four, one person from each game would advance to the 'finals', allowing there to be three finalists in the last round. The winner of this last game wins!, After the games are over, announce the winner of the tournament as well as the runner up and 3rd place. If you are giving away prizes, then you can present the winners with their prizes now as well. You may also want to present all of your guests with a little party favor of some kind and thank all of them for attending the tournament.

Count your opponents’ armies at the end of each turn.,
Block opponent territories within your own territories.,
Nail neighboring contents to prevent them from becoming too powerful.,
Form an alliance with a player of equivalent strength.,
Try to earn your fellow players’ trust.,
Negotiate with your opponents whenever possible.",How to Win at the Game Risk2," It is a good idea to keep track of how many armies your opponents have by counting them after every turn. Doing so will help you to determine who is the weakest and who is the strongest player at all times.Try not to count out loud or let your opponents see you counting their armies or they may become suspicious of you.

, If you get the opportunity to surround an opponent’s territory with your territories, take it. Doing so will allow you to conquer that territory without fear of immediate retaliation. Blocking in an opponent’s territory will also prevent your other opponents from conquering a territory that you want., If one of your opponents is becoming strong and/or is close to conquering an entire continent, then you may want to consider a nailing strategy to slow him or her down. Nailing is when you place a large force on an opponent’s continent to disrupt his or her strategy. Doing so will slow the opponent down and prevent him or her from advancing too quickly., Alliances are very helpful in Risk. When you form an alliance with a fellow player, you can team up against other stronger opponents and have more success in your conquests. Just keep in mind that you may have to fight against each other if you both survive to the end of the game, so the alliance is a temporary measure., If you are deceptive or dishonest, your fellow players may target you more often or be reluctant to negotiate with you. Therefore, it is in your best interest to be honest and try to earn your fellow players’ trust. Avoid lying or making and breaking promises, especially early on in the game.If you often play with the same people, keep in mind that they may remember past deceitful practices in future games that you play with them.

, If you and some other players are competing for a group of territories, then you may end up battling it out until one of you is out of the game. Instead of fighting with a neighboring player over land, try to negotiate with that player to reduce your chances of getting wiped out early in the game.Try to make a treaty with another player. For example, if you have the majority of your armies on Africa and another player has the majority of his or her armies on South America, then you can agree to leave each other alone until you have both had a chance to expand your territories to the north."
"
Make sure that you understand the rules.,
Play often and with more experienced players.,
Use the three basic strategies described in the Risk rulebook.",How to Win at the Game Risk3," If you are new to Risk, then gaining a thorough understanding of the rules may help you to play a better game. Understanding the rules may also help you to catch your opponents is they try to cheat or bend the rules in their favor. Read the rulebook carefully to make sure that you have a good understanding of how to play Risk.

, The more you play, the more you will be able to work on your game strategy, so play as often as you can. It is also a good idea to try to play with more experienced players who are willing to share their knowledge with you.

, The Risk rulebook offers three strategies for players that may help you when you are just getting familiar with the game. Try to use these strategies every time that you play the game and your game will improve. The three pieces of strategic advice given to players by the Risk rulebook include:Hold entire continents to earn bonus reinforcements. The more army reinforcements that you have, the more powerful you are. Therefore, you should try to get as main reinforcements as possible.
Watch your borders for enemy armies. If one of your opponent’s is going to attack you, he or she will probably start to gather forces along one of your borders.
Fortify your borders against enemy attack. Make sure that you place reinforcements along your borders to make it harder for enemies to penetrate your territory.

There are no teams in this form of Scrabble; each person is on his or her own team.,
Each person begins with seven Scrabble tiles placed letter-side down in front of them.

,
Place the remainder of the Scrabble tiles in the center of the round table, letter side down.

,
Clear an area in front of each player on the table in front of them (be sure to clear enough room to complete your puzzle—this will be where your puzzle is formed).

,
To begin the game, one player will say “On your mark, Get set, Go,” at which time all of the players will flip their seven pieces over and begin to form a word with the letters they have.

,
Once one word is created, you may begin to play off of that word, as if using a scrabble board (follow the rules of Scrabble pertaining to horizontal and vertical word arrangements).

,
Don’t forget that the point of this game is to connect your letters to make words in the timeliest manner possible.

,
Once someone has used all of their letters they will shout “take one” and everyone must draw one tile from the center pile of upside-down game pieces.

,
Every player must draw one tile, and they may not switch the tiles that they picked for a different ones.,
The game proceeds in this manner until the pieces in the center of the table are gone or until there are not enough left for everyone to draw from.

,
At this time, when the first person has used up all of their game pieces and there are no more to draw, the game is over.",How to Play Speed Scrabble," The best way to play this game is with 3 to 7 people.;
,,,,,,,, They must draw new pieces even if they have not used their own pieces yet (this is what makes players get backed up and frantic). They cannot trade tiles with other players!

,, Each player adds up their points based on their personal Scrabble board and also adds up the point value of their remaining tiles. The point value of a player's remaining unused tiles is subtracted from the points based on that player's personal Scrabble board. The player with the highest point total (personal Scrabble board value—player's remaining tiles value), is the winner.

"
"
Start the game by placing all the tiles face down.,
Turns move clockwise around the table.

,
The first three players, in turn, each flip over a single tile for all players to see.

,
As soon as a word can be made a player calls out the word and then sets the word in front of him/herself.

,
Players can also use the words created by other players by adding at least one letter and changing it into a new word.,
Two or more words can be taken from other players to create a new word as long as all the taken letters are used.

,
Continue until all the tiles are used.

,
The object is to make as many words as possible with the highest total points.",How to Play Squabble,";
,,,, Then they place the word in front of themselves. Words can be created at any time.

,,, Words must be at least 3 letters long.

Learn to manage your rack.,
Play words on premium squares.,
Make parallel word plays whenever possible.,
Memorize high scoring words in Scrabble using tiles such as the J, Q, X, and Z.,
Use “S” to get points from your opponent’s best plays.,
Extend words when you can.,
Try to play a bingo.,
Make plays based on your lead.,
Block off the premium squares.",How to Win at Scrabble," Shuffling your tiles can help you find playable words, as well as find prefixes, partial words, and common letter combinations. When looking for candidate plays, you also want to make sure your remaining tiles don't contain an imbalance of consonants and vowels, or contain duplicate tiles that will inhibit you from making a high scoring play next turn.Make sure that you exchange some of your letters if you end up with too many vowels. You should not have more than 2-3 vowels on your rack at any one time.;
, The premium squares (double letter, triple letter, double word, and triple word) can dramatically increase your score. Therefore, it is a good idea to make plays using these squares. Doing so will increase your chances of winning the game., Often in Scrabble, you can lay your word alongside (or above or below) an existing word to create a number of 2 or 3-letter words in addition to your main word. The reward for parallel plays can be significant.

, Serious Scrabble players memorize lists of high scoring words to improve their chances of winning. Some common words include QAT, XU, OXO, JIAO, JEU, ZOA, ZEE, and AJI. These words will allow you to score extremely well on future turns.


Try to memorize some of the high scoring two letter words such as Jo, Qi, and Za. These words are easier to remember because they are so short, but they are also great score boosters.

, Although your opponent(s) may not be too pleased, you can add “S” to many words and get an easy points boost. This strategy works even better if the word is long, has a high points value, or if the “S” falls on a premium square. Watch for opportunities to add “S” to an opponent’s word as you play., Compound words are also great score boosters in Scrabble. For example, if an opponent plays BALL and you have the letters to play AIR, then you can play AIR in front of BALL and create the compound word AIRBALL. Playing compound words like this one will improve your score and increase your chances of winning the game., A bingo is a word that uses all 7 tiles in your rack simultaneously in one play. In addition to the points that your play would normally score, you will get an extra 50 points added to your score. It is not always easy to find a bingo: look for 7 letter words in your rack that might fit on the board as well as 8+ letter plays that might play through existing tiles on the board.

, You can help yourself maintain a lead or get a lead by playing certain types of words. If you are trailing your opponent(s), your best bet is to play words that will open up the board and give you opportunities to make better plays. If you are in the lead, then you should play words that will keep the board closed off to your opponents and reduce their opportunities to make better plays., Advanced Scrabble players are always looking ahead to what their opponents might do. Get into the habit of considering what your opponent may do if you play a certain word and try to block any premium squares that your opponent may want to use during his or her turn.Keep in mind that blocking your opponent may not always be possible, but if you do it whenever possible, it may help you to hold onto your lead and win the game.

Be the banker to stay close to the money.,
Steal money before the game begins.,
Take a few dollars when the other players leave the table.,
Keep your money pile messy.",How to Cheat at Monopoly1," Place the bank behind you so no one can reach it. This will make them give you the money first. Every so often, instead of putting the money in the bank, slip it underneath you. Then, secretly take it out, and put it in your stash of money., If you know that you will be playing Monopoly in a few hours, get to the game box, and slip out a bill from each denomination. Then, put the game back, and keep the money to use for the game. During the game, you can add the bills to your money pile, and no one will ever know.


Make sure that you keep your money pile messy when you add to it so that it is not obvious that you have an extra $500 bill. That is the bill that people may notice more easily.

, Any chance you have to steal a few bills from the bank, or from another player, take it. Act like you are busy on your phone, or distracted with something other than the game right after you do it to deter any suspicion., Instead of keeping your money organized, and neatly piled by denomination, keep it all together, and out of order. It is common for players to want to keep their money nice and orderly, but if you leave it messy, it will be easier to steal some money occasionally."

Call ""Time out!"",
Continue playing until someone wins the game.",How to Play Scrabble Slam," The 55-card edition is designed for up to 4 players and the 84-card edition is designed for up to 6 players. Keep in mind that because the deck will be divided among all the players after the starting word is made, more players means fewer cards in each person's hand., The starting word must have four letters and should be a word that can be made into another 4-letter word by changing one of its letters.Good starting words include ""GAME,"" which can be turned into ""FAME,"" ""LAME,"" ""GATE,"" or ""GAZE,"" and ""WARE,"" which can be changed into ""WERE,"" ""WARM,"" ""WARN,"" or ""WART.""
Bad starting words include ""ECHO"" and ""EXAM,"" which cannot readily be turned well-known 4-letter words.

, Place these cards on your table or playing surface where everyone can see them and reach them. Make sure that they are forming the starting word you have chosen. Leave a bit of space between the cards so that the cards you put on top of these cards will not overlap., You may want to shuffle the cards first to make sure that everyone gets a good mixture of letters. Make sure that everyone has the same number of cards when you are done dealing the cards. Remember, all of the cards should be dealt to players; there should be no cards left in the deck., Remind your fellow players that the cards are two-sided. They are printed with a letter on each side, or with a letter on one side and a blank space on the other. Either side of the card may be played to make a legal word, with the blank serving as a ""wild letter"" as in the Scrabble board game.Get into the habit of looking at the upper left edge of your cards, rather than flipping them back and forth. At the upper left edge you can see the two letters that the card represents.

, The official call to begin play is ""Ready, set, slam""; however, you can call ""Go,"" ""Start,"" or something similar, if you wish. Just make it clear to your fellow players that the game is starting. Scrabble Slam! is a fast-paced game, so everyone needs to be ready to play when it is time to start., Scrabble Slam! is a speed game; players do not take turns placing new letters on the word. If you are playing with young children, then you may want to consider making teams to give them more chances to play.Words in Scrabble Slam! are restricted the same as in the Scrabble crossword game: you can't use slang, acronyms, proper names for people or places, hyphenated words, or words with apostrophes.
You cannot play the same letter if it will make the same word. For example, if the current word is ""BALE,"" you cannot play another ""B"" immediately on top of the ""B"" in the word. You can, however, play a ""G"" to change the word to ""GALE"" and then play a ""B"" to change the word back to ""BALE"" if you can do so before another player changes the word to something else.

, to challenge a word. If you don’t think that something one of your fellow players has played is a real word, then you can call for a time out. Then, stop playing to discuss the word's legitimacy and consult a dictionary if necessary. If the word is not a legal Scrabble Slam! word, the player making the word must take back the letter card used to make it., The game is over when one player has no more cards or no more legal plays can be made. At this point, you can declare a winner. If someone gets rid of all of his or her cards first, that player is the winner. If all of the players still have cards and no one can make a play, then whoever has the fewest cards left is the winner."

Don't hesitate to swap some tiles if you're in a tough situation.,
Practice makes perfect.",How to Improve Your Scrabble Score," They're the ""glue"" of Scrabble. Some two-letter words are obvious and worth a lot of points (HE, AX), but there are others, which, when played properly, can add up to a lot of points (JO, XI, XU, QI) especially if you're able to use the high scoring letter in two different words in the same turn. Lists of the two letter words can be found in many places throughout the internet.


Example: Building off the word LABEL, one could play the word AX under the LA and get double points off the X.;
, If there's a word already on the board with a lot of points, you can leverage these points by adding a suffix or a prefix to the word.

, An S should only be used when it adds at least 8 points to your turn (unless you have two of them). A blank should not be used unless you can get an extra 25 points for using it. Blanks and Ss can be very helpful in playing a bingo, (when you play all seven letters at once).

, Playing all seven letters in one turn will give you an additional 50 points, which can ultimately win the game for you. Common prefixes and suffixes, the blank and the S will all be very helpful in winning the game. For example, if you have an ED, it is possible you can rearrange the other five letters into a word using the ED suffix.

,, For example, if you have all consonants, it's possible you might only be able to play one letter and there's a good chance the next letter you draw will also be a consonant. Instead of setting yourself up for two low-scoring plays, swap out some lower value letters and increase your chances for one higher scoring play.

, Play often! There are ways to play online if you can't always find an opponent. You will learn new words or even strategies this way.

First, read and familiarize yourself with the rules.,
In accordance with the rules, pick your empire.,
Place your Capital/Castle in a defensible position.,
Stake out your territory.,
Reinforcement phase: If you placed an army in someone else's territory, follow through and defend it to withstand the first turn.,
Now, as the game starts, carefully observe what goes on before your turn if you are not going first.,
Essentially repeat the past step as the rounds shift-Remember, even if you're last, you still have someone playing the turn after you.

,
Push, push, push-be aggressive!,
When ready and have a sufficient army (the size will depend on your target) aim for a Breakthrough or Blitz strategy.,
After the elimination of some players, Castle Risk may evolve into a two or three sided arms race.",How to Effectively Play Castle Risk,";
, If you and your friends are OK with it, you can each choose your own Empires. Different Empires: Empires have their advantages and disadvantages.


French Empire: Often seen as the best empire, France has easy access to an unoccupied Britain, and superior access to Spain. It is also somewhat defensible
British Empire: Held in high regard by the author, Britain is a highly defensible empire, with only two points of land entrance.
Russian Empire: Russia is disadvantaged in that it borders two empires-but if they are not occupied, then they can easily be taken
Ottoman Empire: This is a somewhat defensible empire, with a prime spot for a capital on a bottleneck.
Austrian Empire: Definitely the least defensible of the empires, Austria should be avoided on the basis that it is likely to be completely surrounded by enemies and a limited coastline.
German Empire: Faced with the same problems as the Austrian Empire, Germany is unlikely to be a long-lasting empire.

, A Coastline is an excellent place to place it. You will likely have many troops in your Capital, so you will be able to use the Admiral card to attack from here to a distant territory effectively.

, Do your best to fill in your empire, as it will grant you a bonus. Do not be afraid to place an army in someone else's territory to augment their bonus. If they are placing outside their territory, you may finish filling in your territory before they do. Look for those people. DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS TO MORE THAN ONE PERSON. Don't be surprised if someone does this to you. When the reinforcement phase comes, you can reinforce to repel them.

, Just a few armies can intimidate them into turning their reinforcements elsewhere or send them into a paranoid defense, leaving them out of the aggressive picture.


If you fell victim to this, make sure you have the forces to repel and conquer this territory. You will get a bonus for holding the territory, and the territory can serve as a foothold for an invasion.

, Watch for an exposed area. If a country is guarded with only one army feel free to devote an army or two to its capture. Don't devote more forces than absolutely necessary unless you plan to follow through and Blitz (see below) their territory.


If you are not able to reach an exposed position, alert someone who would be inclined to form a truce or alliance with you. They will more than likely take up the chance.

,, if you can force your enemy's borders to their capital, you're in great shape. Don't overexpose yourself.

, You will either want to go straight for the eye, or Capital, or seek to deprive your enemy of their valuable territories-if doing the latter, don't overexpose yourself, i.e. surrounding their capital with one army territories, and the help of an ally is appreciated. If going for the capital, make sure you have a massive army-remember, the capitol gets a defense bonus.

, At this point, look for openings in defenses-overpower them and push to the capital, or deprive them of land like in the last step-you can trust allies at this point.

Quickly roll the dice.,
Conceal your Chance and Community Chest cards.,
Do not point out when you land on one of your opponent's properties.",How to Cheat at Monopoly2," If you find an opportunity to roll the dice while the other players are talking, do not call for their attention just so they can watch you roll. Let them stay distracted, and roll the dice. Before anyone can see the numbers, move your marker wherever you want it.Be sure you know how many spaces you move so when your opponent asks you what you rolled, you can give them an answer that matches the spot you moved to. If a player questions your move, just keep a straight face, and keep with the lie.

, Instead of showing off these cards when you draw them, act pleased with whatever card you get, and collect what amount is requested on the card, even if the card is telling you to pay. Then, quickly put the card back into the pile and move on., If the other players are not paying attention to their properties, or where you land, let it go unnoticed. The official rules explain that you will not have to pay if your opponent has still not noticed by the time two other people take a turn.Try to get the next two players to take their turn by complaining about how the game is moving too slowly. This will hopefully speed up the game so you won't have to pay!
Keep the owner of the property you landed on distracted. Tell that person a funny joke, or tell them a long story until the next two turns are taken.

Form an alliance with another player.,
Negotiate with other players.,
Bribe the other players.",How to Cheat at Monopoly3," Before the game starts, make a deal with another player to help one another out, but do not let any of the other players know. While you cannot stay alliances the entire game, it may help you knockout other players. Here are some sneaky tricks you can practice together:


You and your partner should not charge each other money for landing on property you both own. You can practice this until you have bankrupted the other players.
You can acquisition the properties you both want by letting each other know what you want, and then as you land on those spots, you can buy and sell them to that player in hopes they do the same for you.

, If you really want all of the railroads, and another player owns one of those properties, try to set up an agreement that allows you both to get the properties you want. Make a deal where if you land on a property that another player wants, you can buy it, and then sell it to them at the same cost you bought it for so long as that player does the same in return for a property you want. This may be an easy way to take the chance out of owning your desired properties.

, If you have your eye on a property, but do not have the funds to purchase it, try offering a real-life bribe to another player. Properties like Park Place and Boardwalk may seem like a good trade for someone looking for a free dinner or favor. So if you do not have the money to buy a property, or want to steal one from another player, try offering that person something they want outside of Monopoly as a trade."

If you don't make a word, the tiles will display the word ""Out,"" which means that you have been eliminated from the game., After “next” or “out” appears on the screen, a new set of 5 letters will be displayed. The next player must make a 5-letter word from those letters within the time limit and pass the tiles along.As the game progresses, the amount of time to recognize and make a 5-letter word will grow shorter.

, Keep passing the tiles until all but one player has been eliminated from the game. The last player left is the winner!"
"
Compete against one person.,
Make your plays with a timer.,
Say “Hold” to decide if you want to challenge your opponent.,
Trade in tiles according to the rules.,
Keep your own score.,
Call the director if there is a problem.",How to Play Competitive Scrabble2," Although the Scrabble game comes with enough racks to accommodate as many as 4 players, players in Scrabble tournaments play head-to-head against only a single opponent. Playing with just one person may help you to get used to this type of play before your first tournament., As in chess, competitive Scrabble is played to time and uses a timer to keep track of how long each player takes to place tiles on the board. Each player has a total of 25 minutes to make his or her plays, with the time set by setting an analog chess clock to 25 minutes before the hour or setting a digital clock for a 25-minute period.Once it is decided which player will play first, the first player's clock is started. The player may take as long as necessary within the time remaining on the clock to place his or her tiles and declare the point value of the word played. The player may reconsider the play, change, or retract it; however, once he or she pushes the button to stop his or her timer and start the opponent's, the move is set.
If either player exceeds the 25-minute time limit for making his or her moves, the game continues, but the offending player loses 10 points for each minute of play over the limit.

, Before making his or her own play, the opponent can challenge the legality of the player's move by saying, ""Hold."" If the opponent does this, the player is stopped from taking replacement tiles from the bag. The opponent can then decide to accept the player's move, thus letting the player draw new tiles, or declare, ""Challenge,"" at which point the clock is stopped for the judge to determine whether the words challenged in the play (there may be as many as 8) are acceptable or unacceptable.If all words in the challenge are accepted, the play is acceptable, and the tiles remain. If any of the words are judged unacceptable, the entire play is forfeited, the player takes back the tiles laid down to make the play and forfeits that turn.
If there is no challenge, the opponent proceeds to play his or her tiles and pushes the timer button when he or she is satisfied with the word(s) made.

, If you want to trade in some of your tiles for different ones, then you need to use a turn to do so and announce your intentions as well. When trading, the player lays the tiles that he or she wants to trade face down. Then, the player announces the number of tiles to be traded and presses the timer button to commit. The actual trading of tiles is done during the opponent's play time.


Call the director over if you draw too many tiles by accident., As in golf, each player is responsible for keeping his or her own score in competitive Scrabble games. Players are permitted to prepare their own score sheets, which may include the reference list of how many of each letter tile are in the game and a way to track how many of them have been played.


It is also a good idea to track your opponent’s score and to announce your scores during the game. Just make sure that you do so on your time, not your opponent’s time., If at any time during your game, you or your opponent has a question or problem, you should call the director over to handle it. Do not waste game time to try to settle a dispute by yourselves. Make sure that you stop the clock when you call for a director so that neither player is losing time while you wait."

Familiarize yourself with the Official Tournament and Club Word List.,
Break words down into types.,
Learn the art of rack management.,
Practice playing the board to your best advantage.",How to Play Competitive Scrabble3," While recreational Scrabble players often use whatever hard-copy or online dictionary happens to be handy as a reference, players who compete in Scrabble tournaments use the Official Tournament and Club Word List. If you don’t already have a copy, get one and start using it when you play.


The ""Official Tournament and Club Word List"", published by Merriam-Webster, is the reference dictionary used in tournaments sanctioned by the North American Scrabble Players Association., Because the OTCWL and similar reference dictionaries contain too many words to memorize directly, many competitive Scrabble players break words down into smaller lists by commonalities, such as words of 2 letters, words of 3 letters, words with 4 or more vowels, and words that use Q without a U after it.There are 105 2 letter words in Scrabble including be, ma, jo, za, and it., Rack management is the skill of knowing what words you can make out of the tiles presently on your rack, as well as knowing which tiles to hold onto for later, and when to exchange tiles for best advantage. This skill begins with an ability to recognize combinations of letters that appear in most words and to anagram the letters on your rack into meaningful words.A Scrabble player skilled at managing his or her rack can play all 7 tiles not just once during a game, but as many as 3 or 4 times.

, Novice Scrabble players place tiles on the board wherever they see places to put them. Competitive Scrabble players know how to place words to use the premium squares (double- and triple-letter, double- and triple-word) to their best advantage and also how to lay down words to block their opponent's access to those squares. They can also place tiles so as to make not just one word off their opponent's word, but several.

"
"
Rearrange your tiles on your rack.,
Watch for common prefixes and suffixes.,
Look for other common letter combinations.,
Familiarize yourself with common compound words.,
Strike a balance.",How to Manage a Rack in Scrabble1," Much of rack management in Scrabble is based on the ability to create anagrams, that is, to rearrange the order of the letters on your rack into meaningful words. You may find it helpful to move the tiles around on your rack until you see a word that you recognize. As you play the game more often, you'll develop the ability to rearrange the letters in your head.


When rearranging tiles, it helps to place the tiles where they often appear in words. For example, letters like F and J are more likely to appear at the beginnings of words, so place them on the left side of your rack. But letters like S and Y are more likely to appear at the end of words, so place them on the right side of your rack.;
, Many words are formed by adding either a prefix to the beginning of the root word or a suffix to the end of the root word to change its meaning, tense, or part of speech. By recognizing these prefixes and suffixes when their letters appear on your rack, you can begin to make meaningful words out of the string of letters in front of you.Common prefixes: Common prefixes include DIS-, RE-, UN-, IN-, OUT-, OVER-, and ANTI-.
Common suffixes: Common suffixes include -S, -ES, -ED, -ING, -LY, -IER, -IEST, and other superlatives.

, Identifying common letter combinations like CH, ST, SH, QU, LY, TH, etc. can also help you find words using the tiles on your rack. If you can't make a word that uses these combinations right away, you may want to hold onto the letters until the opportunity to play them arises.

, As you start to recognize common letter combinations used in words, you'll eventually start to recognize entire words on your rack. The next step is to start putting small words together into compound words, either with two words found on your rack or with a word on your rack and a word already on the board.


For example, if you can find both LOW and DOWN in the letters your rack (with a separate W for each word), you can make the compound word LOWDOWN. Or, if the word HEAD is on the board, you can turn it into GODHEAD or BULKHEAD if you have the appropriate tiles on your rack and there are enough free spaces ahead of the H.
Related to this skill is the ability to recognize words within words. With some practice and the right letter tiles, you can expand PRAISE into APPRAISER or LIST into ENLISTEE, possibly even using both triple-word spaces at once.

, Learn to balance the score of the letters you play against the quality of tiles remaining on your rack and prospective words that can be made using the letters you play. As you start becoming more familiar with the words you can make in Scrabble, you need to start evaluating how well you can continue to make good plays while preventing your opponents from making major plays on your words.


Some Scrabble players prefer to emphasize improving the selection of tiles on their racks through strategic play, while other players rely more on the layout of letters on the board.
Whichever style of play you prefer, it helps to keep track of how many of each letter have been played and how many are left. If 11 of the 12 E tiles have been played and you have the last one, you may want to hang onto it to give yourself better options. This is especially applicable when holding the S or the blank, which can allow you a big score or a bingo on future turns.

Look for potentially invalid plays.,
Announce your challenge before your opponent has drawn their tiles.,
Look up the word.,
Deal with the consequences.",How to Challenge a Word in Scrabble1," If one of your fellow players puts down a strange word or one that you think is not spelled correctly, then you may want to challenge the word. Pay close attention to the plays that your fellow players make during their turns, including small words that are created in conjunction with larger ones.;
, If you decide that you want to challenge a word, you need to announce your intent to challenge the word before the next player has drawn their tiles. Make sure that you state the specific word or words when you issue your challenge.Right after the suspect word has been played, say something like, “I challenge the word:____.""

, To verify whether or not the word that has been played is a valid word, you or another player (not the player being challenged) will need to look it up in the dictionary. If the word is not in the dictionary, then announce that the play was invalid. If it was correct, then announce that the play was valid., Either you or the player you challenged will lose a turn. If you challenged the player and the word was valid, then you lose your next turn. If the word was invalid, then the person you challenged must remove the tiles from the board, does not gain any points for the tiles, and loses that turn. The player may not put down a different word until his or her next turn.If you think that losing a turn for challenging another player is too harsh, you may choose to play by a different rule for challenges. Some players choose to have no penalty for challenging or to only lose 5 points for challenging if the word turns out to be valid. These rules must be agreed upon before the start of the game."

Know the power of your specific tiles.,
Keep track of the tiles.",How to Play Scrabble," Before you begin your game, make sure that you have everything that you need to play Scrabble. You will need a game board, 100 letter tiles, one letter rack for each player, and a cloth bag to hold the letter tiles. You will also need 1-3 other people to play with., It is possible that during the course of your game, someone will play a word that another play believes is spelled wrong or that is not a word at all. In a situation like this, you will need to look up the word in a dictionary. Make sure that you have a dictionary on hand to deal with challenges., To make sure that the letters are mixed up, put them into the bag, close it, and shake them around a bit. If you don’t have a bag to use, you can put all of the letters face down on the table and shuffle them. , Pass the bag around the table and allow each player to draw one letter tile. Then, place your letter tiles face up on the table. The player with the letter that is closest to the letter “A” gets to go first. Put these letters back into the bag and shuffle them again before drawing tiles., Beginning with the player who got the letter closest to “A”, pass the tile bag around and have each player draw seven tiles without looking into the bag. Do not show these tiles to your fellow players. Just put them onto your tile rack and pass the bag to the next player until everyone has drawn their letters., The player who chose the letter closest to “A” gets to play the first word. The word must use at least two tiles and it must be placed across the star square in the center of the board. The word can be laid out in a vertical or horizontal fashion, but it cannot be diagonal.


When calculating the first word score, keep in mind that the player who places the first word gets to double his or her total score because the star counts as a Premium Square with a double word bonus. For example, if the total value of the first word played was 8, then the player would receive a score of 16., After you have put down a word, make sure that you count up your points. Add up the points on the upper right hand corner of each of the tiles you laid down. If you placed a tile on a Premium Square, adjust your score as indicated by the Premium Square.For example, if you place a word over a square that says “Double Word” on it, then you should double the total value of your word. If you place a tile over a square that says “Double Letter”, then you should double the value of that letter tile only when you calculate your score.

, After each of your turns, you will need to draw as many new tiles as you just played. For example, if you played three of your tiles to form a word during your turn, then you need to draw three new tiles at the end of your turn. Place these new tiles on your rack and pass the bag to the next player., On your next turn, you will have to add onto the words that your opponents have just played. That means that you cannot just create a freestanding word on the board, all of the tiles must be connected.


As you build onto the words that your opponents have played, make sure that you consider all of the connected tiles. Your addition to the board must create at least one new word, but if you connect to other tiles, from other directions, then you need to make sure that you are creating valid words with these connections., It is a good idea to consider multiple plays during each of your turns and to go with the play that will gain you the most points. Look for opportunities to incorporate Premium Squares and high value letters like “Z” and “Q” into your plays.Available Premium Squares include:



Double Letter Score: This means that a letter placed on this square receives double the number of points that are shown on the letter.

Double Word Score: This means that a word that is made that includes the letter that is placed on this square receives double the number of points that it otherwise would.

Triple Letter Score: This means that a letter placed on this square receives three times the number of points that are shown on the letter.

Triple Word Score: This means that a word that is made that includes the letter that is placed on this square receives triple the number of points that it otherwise would.

, If you think that a player has played a word that does not exist or that another player has misspelled a word, then you can challenge that player. When you challenge a player, you look up the word in the dictionary.If the word is in the dictionary and the player has spelled it correctly, then the word stays and the player gets the points. The challenger loses his or her turn.
If the word is not in the dictionary or the player has spelled it incorrectly, then the player must remove the word from the board. The player gains no points and loses that turn.

, At some point during the game, you may decide that you want to exchange some or all of your tiles for new ones. You can use a turn to get new tiles. Just discard the tiles that you no longer want into the bag, shuffle the bag and draw the number of tiles that you discarded. Just keep in mind that you cannot play a word in addition to drawing new tiles, this will count as your turn., It is important to keep a careful tally of each player’s scores as you play. Each player should announce his or her score after adding it up and then the score keeper should write it down right away., Premium Squares will alter your word scores, so pay attention to these when you play words. You can only use the bonus from a Premium Square if you laid the tile over that square during the current turn. You cannot incorporate bonuses from Premium Squares that you already counted in a different turn or that were counted by a different player.When adding the bonuses for plays with multiple Premium Squares, add the letter bonuses in before the word bonuses. For example, if you spell a word that has a double letter bonus and a triple word bonus, add the double letter bonus to your total before multiplying the total by three.

, A BINGO is when you use all seven of your tiles to play a word. When this happens, you should add up the total value of your word plus any bonuses gained from Premium Tiles and then add 50 points., After all of the players have exhausted their tiles or cannot play any more words, add up each player’s points total. As the score keeper adds the totals, each player should let him or her know the points value (if any) of the tiles he or she has left over. Deduct this value from each player’s points total to determine each player’s final score., After the score keeper has added each player’s scores and deducted the values of any unused tiles, he or she may announce the winner. The person who has the highest score wins the game. Second place goes to the person with the second-highest score, and so on.

, Scrabble is a fun game that is easy to learn, so it’s a great way to spend time with friends. Invite a few of your friends over for a Scrabble night. You will get lots of practice and it will make for a fun evening.

, Perhaps you want to play Scrabble on a weekly basis. If you don’t know many people who would be into playing Scrabble with you on such a regular basis, then a Scrabble club might be for you. Look for a club in your area or consider forming your own Scrabble club., After you have developed your skills a bit and feel ready to compete with other players, try entering a Scrabble tournament. You will get to play lots of games and you will meet people who share your love of the game., If you're going to play professionally, such as at the National Scrabble Tournaments, you need to play by the rules. Buy an official dictionary and enforce the rules when playing with friends. You need to practice how you'll play if you're going to be a professional.


You can practice against other professionals online at the Internet Scrabble Club, a sort of meeting place for serious players.This can help you learn the tricky, odd words needed to play professionally, like ""umiak,"" ""MBAQANGA,"" or ""qi.""

, A tournament is not like your classic living room Scrabble. There are rules and regulations to make sure everything goes smoothly. While you can read the entire rule-book here, the basics include:


Time yourself, starting and stopping with each turn.
Recording score, for both players, after each turn.
Drawing new tiles at eye level, with your palms open, looking away from the bag.
The ability to call a ""Hold,"" which gives you 15 seconds to challenge a word.
Using a computer to adjudicate disputes., This is where the big-dogs get into tournaments. They sanction the major events, which you only have to be a member to join. If you want to be a professional, this is the way to go.


If you're looking to practice in person a bit, see if your town or city has a local Scrabble Club. This is a good place to practice some tournament play before going to NASPA if you're nervous.

, In Scrabble, words are your weapons. So, the more you know, the better you'll be. Take the time to thumb through the dictionary once a day. Look up an online ""word of the day."" Best yet, go online and search ""Scrabble Word Lists."" The professionals actually make flash-cards and study the lists religiously, focusing especially on ""weird word lists"" that can save you in a pinch.You can even look up lists for one letter-- like all words that contain that pesky ""X"" or ""Q.""
While the official Scrabble dictionary doesn't contain profanity or slurs, they are actually all fair game in tournament play., Some tiles are worth a lot more than others -- the S, for example, is a powerful way to tack on an extra letter to just about any word. Blank tiles should be saved for a huge word or scoring play, since you can use them easily. And get rid of Qs quickly, preferably on small words like ""qi"" or ""qat"" (both legal words).


Just playing your tiles and scoring points is generally better than holding on for a long time to get one great word or Triple Word Score. Just keep scoring away., Professionals actually track the tiles, keeping mental or written notes of what is left in the bag. This gets crucial as the game continues. If you're going to exchange, hoping to get a new vowel, you should know vaguely how many vowels are in the bag. If there aren't a lot of Qs, Vs, and Zs on the board, and you don't have any, you can be sure your opponent has a few (meaning you might risk opening up a Triple Word Score -- hoping they can't hit it).


You can find the exact numbers of each tile here."
"
Know when and how many tiles to exchange.,
Learn which letters are more likely to appear in bonus words.,
Hang onto your blanks.,
Keep a good mix of vowels and consonants.,
Play high-scoring tiles as soon as you can.,
Play away the duplicate letters on your rack.,
Learn the most common 7-letter words in Scrabble.,
Look for letter combinations that can be built into bingos.,
Create words from individual letters instead of trying to force certain words.",How to Manage a Rack in Scrabble2," Knowing when and how many tiles to exchange can help to maximize your score. If you can't make a word out of the tiles you have, you can exchange any or all of them for new tiles, at the cost of your turn.When exchanging tiles in the early game, you'll want to exchange as many tiles as you can to try to get an S or a blank.
In the middle of the game, you'll want to hold onto to a medium or high-scoring tile to have a better chance of making a high-scoring word.
Near the end of the game, you'll want to discard high-scoring tiles unless you see places on the board you can play them with the right additional letters.

, The distribution and point value of Scrabble tiles are based on the relative frequency of each letter's appearance in English language words. Thus, the more common the letter, the more likely it will appear in a 7-letter word or can be played in a word that will earn double or triple word score value.Hold on to the more common vowels and consonants for later and play the less common ones early on.
The most common vowels, in order, are E, A, I, O, and U.
The most common consonants, in order, are S, R, T, N, L, D, G, C, B, M, P, H, F, Y, V, W, K, X, J, Z, and Q.
Be aware that the above lists are influenced by what other letters you have on your rack. For instance, if you have an C on your rack, you'll want to hold onto an H rather than a G, since CH is a good letter combination while CG is not. Note that not all expert Scrabble players agree on the letter rankings shown above.
Also keep in mind that letters that haven't been played will influence which tiles you should hold on to and which you should play. You'll want to keep track of the number of U tiles and hold on to yours if you see the Q tile hasn't been played (and also memorize Q words that don't use the U, such as QI and QAT).

, The blank is universally considered to be the strongest tile in Scrabble because of its ability to score and form a bingo. (If you have both blanks, you have an 80 percent chance of making a bingo word.)

, Strive to have a mix of vowels and consonants at all times, but your rack should favor consonants over vowels. Try to have 4 consonants to 3 vowels or 5 consonants to 2 vowels. This makeup will make it easier for you to form words that will score bonuses on the board or allow you to play all of your tiles at once.If your rack has 6 vowels and only 1 consonant, you should look to play at least 3 of those vowels on your next turn.
You can improve your ability to keep a good mix of vowels and consonants by memorizing vowel-rich 4-letter words such as AEON, AIDE, and AREA and 5-letter words such as AERIE, AUDIO, and QUEUE.

, It's generally best to play letters such as J, Q, X, and Z as soon as you can play them to your best advantage.You may want to hold them a few turns in hope of being able to play them on a premium letter space or in a word that counts for double or triple points, but this opportunity will decline as more tiles are placed on the board. Near the end, it may be better to play the letter off than risk getting caught with it. Also, the low scoring tiles are more likely to be found in longer words than in shorter ones.


Lean towards playing off high point tiles like the B, F, W, and Y quickly to open up more possibilities for making words with 1- and 2-point letter tiles. Also, note that late in the game, the Q (especially without the U) can be as difficult to play since very few short words contain the Q.
You can remember which tiles are the 1- and 2-point letters with the word DEREGULATIONS, which contains all the letters with those point values.

, Common double-letter combinations such as EE, FF, MM, PP, and TT are more likely to appear in words than are AA, CC, HH, II, UU, and VV. If you have two or more of these less common repeated letters, play the duplicates as soon as you can., It is possible, though rare, to draw seven tiles at once that form a word. The most likely such word, based on the frequency of its letters in Scrabble, is ANEROID, meaning ""without liquid,"" as in an aneroid barometer. Some other words that you can form by playing seven tiles at once include ETESIAN, ISATINE, INOSITE, ATONIES, and ERASION.


In most cases, you'll only be able to play a 7-letter word if you're the first player to play in the first round. Some of these 7-letter words take an -S plural, however, so you may be able to play them on an open S if there are seven open spaces above or to the left of the S played on an existing word.

, Some letter combinations not only make recognizable short words, but you can find them in longer words. You can find the letters in REST and TRAIN in bingos such as URANITE, SOOTIER, and STOURIE. The strongest 6-letter combination is the word TISANE, which can form a seven letter word with any letter other than the Q or Y.


Look for letter combinations within your rack and in places on the board where you can use all of the letters on your rack to form an 8-, 9-, or even 10-letter word.

, It may be difficult to figure out bingo words, or even meaningful words, from the letters on your rack. Sometimes, the best approach is to brainstorm words that include a few of the tiles on your rack and then see how many of the other letters are present, either on the rack or the board. You may need to close your eyes or look away from the board for a moment to do this.

Select a dictionary to use for challenges before you start the game.",How to Challenge a Word in Scrabble2," Challenging a word in Scrabble is a way to ensure that all of the plays are actual words and no one is making up words just to score points. It is important to challenge words that seem invalid so that another player cannot gain an advantage.You may also learn new words in the process of challenging another player because some of your opponents may know obscure words that you have never encountered before.

, You can only challenge a word right after a player has placed that word. You may not wait until a few other players have taken their turns and then make the challenge. , Keep in mind that challenging a word will result in a lost turn for either you or your opponent. Therefore, you should be fairly sure that your opponent has played an invalid word before making a challenge. Otherwise, you might lose an opportunity to score points, which may result in you losing the game., It is essential to have a dictionary out when you play Scrabble so that you can use it if a word is challenged. You may not use the dictionary to look up words before they are placed. The dictionary should only be used to look up words that have been challenged. Make sure that you and your fellow players all agree on a dictionary to use for challenges."

Talk with your child and discover what they think they need in the ""Spy Base"".,

Check around and see if you can get some scrap wood from a construction site. Otherwise, you'll have to buy it.

,, Against a wooden fence is best (Only three walls to build and the fence can help support the structure.)


If the child is old enough to assist, by all means allow the child to do so. He/she will enjoy the structure much more if he helps to build it. If his friends are interested, let them help too. Children want to build things themselves. You should assist with jobs involving saws, drills, etc., but they should do as much as possible.

, Always consider whether the framework you have is sufficient. If necessary, add to the framework to keep it safe.


You will need at least one square frame to attach the plywood to. You will need two if you are building a freestanding structure.
If you are attaching the spy base to a wooden fence, Nail two 2x4 joists to the fence base (the part the planks are nailed to). One square frame will be needed for the front of the structure.
If the spy base is freestanding, you will need two square frames to attach the walls to.

,


The walls do not have to be plywood, but need to be durable enough to withstand the elements.

, The door should be hinged on the inside of the base (We wouldn't want those enemies knowing how to get in). Drill a hole large enough to put a finger through (without getting stuck) so the door can be pulled open.

,


One way to allow outside ""observation"" is by leaving a gap between the top of walls and the roof.

, Add extra supports as this will be stood on, if not built too high, the platform can also double as seating. You could build the platform around the inside perimeter.

Cut 3"" openings at the top front and bottom back of the tube (the 3""x15"" sides), to accommodate the mirrors.
Tape the one mirror inside the top opening and one inside the bottom opening.
Make sure the mirrors face each other.
Make sure the mirrors sit at 45 degree angles so that they reflect images to each other.Close off the ends of the tube with more cardboard.
Aim the top of the periscope at what you want to see.
View the scene in the lower mirror.

, You will be able to see if a room is empty or occupied without opening the door.Cut the thick black paper to size (approx. 8 times as long as the diameter of the marble, and 5 times as wide).
Put the marble in the middle of the paper, and roll the paper tightly around it.
Stick it with tape to make a tube.
Push the marble to one end until it's just sticking out. The half of the marble will still be inside, and half of it will be outside.
Stick the marble end through a keyhole.
Look through the non-marble end.
You will have a fish-eye (but upside down) view of the room.

, You will be able to follow someone without being detected.


Wear a hat to cover your hair.
Wear a wig or hat with a wig attached to change your hair color and style.

Wear clothing that suggests you are a different gender.

, Change the way your face looks to remain undetected.


Use make up to make yourself look older or younger.Buy colored contact lenses to change your eye color.
Use dark glasses to obscure your face.

, Not all disguises will work in all situations.


Make sure to choose a disguise that makes sense. Do not dress as a fisherman to spy on someone in an office setting, for example.
Simple disguises can work just as well as complicated ones.You don't need to have every single detail right but make sure you get the main things correct. A firefighter would not wear sneakers in uniform, for example.

, The federal government and local authorities have laws regarding recording people.


Federal law allows conversations to be recorded if at least one person knows of the recording. However, some states have laws that require all parties in the conversation to be aware of the recording.It is almost always illegal to record a conversation if you are not a part of it.Recording law enforcement is legal in some circumstances, as long you are not interfering with their ability to do their job.It is illegal to photograph someone without their permission where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as in a doctor’s office or in their home.Privacy laws also protect children., Recent anti-stalking laws have made it a criminal offense to follow someone in some cases.If you repeatedly follow someone, you may be reported as a stalker.Every state has some version of an anti-stalking law."

Cut the cardboard into 3-inch squares or whatever you want.,
On the cardboard, write your first name or spy codename and your role (ex.,
Go online and make/find a small logo that will be for your club.,
Glue your logo and picture onto the cardboard.

, Make sure it isn't moist or too thick because you want your cards to last a while.

, Make sure they look different from other club's spy cards but they look the same as other cards in your group.

, President, secretary, ect). You can always do this on the computer and glue it to the cardboard.

",How to Move Stealthily," Don't run unless you're making a mad break for cover or you absolutely have to. If you decide to wear shoes, try an old pair of tennis shoes or even uggs! But try to avoid slippers and flip flops. Another useful tip when seeking around is to walk from heel to toe. That should decrease the sound of your footsteps.;

Then, each team should go to a separate corner of the room/area that you are playing in.;
, Have the director(s) discuss or think about a topic or word for the skits. When it is decided, the director should announce the designated topic to the other players. Then they should inform the players on what kind of skit they are expecting (comedy, horror, drama, etc.)

, The director should now set a timer for 1-2 minutes, and shout go! Players should immediately begin planning a skit that circulates around the topic. They must work quickly and efficiently to get this done.

, The director should announce when the timer has stopped. All players should stop what they're doing and sit down in their corner, whether they're finished or not. The director chooses a team to go first. This team performs their skit, improvising all props. Skits should only be 1-5 minutes long.

, The director will think about the performance. If there are two, the directors will discuss it. There are five skills the directors will consider:


acting
how closely the people followed the theme
creativity and originality

Ensure that these groups of four are people who do not typically interact with one another. Follow a similar approach whether it be in a classroom or other an environment of playtime for kids. Getting to know each other more personally is important to the child’s development of his or her sense of self , a great attribute in both social and learning environments for kids.

, Everyone in the group writing questions should avoid rhetorical, straight-to-the-point ""yes"" or ""no"" questions. Instead, ask questions that will allow the group to get to know one another.


These questions include, but are not limited to:

Where are you from?

The two players instead create and maintain a conversation by asking questions back and forth.

, Player 1 can asks the question, “Do you like the weather outside today?” Like a game of tennis, the second player serves the questioning back, by countering with a different question, “Do you hate the weather outside today?”

, In response to the question, “Do you like the weather outside today?”, the below question responses are invalid:


Repetition: ”Do YOU like the weather outside today?”
Statement: “I like the weather outside today.”

Play with a theme for Simon.,
Incorporate sports activities.",How to Play Simon Says," Simon says is a simple and fun game played by children all over the world. Although Simon says is normally reserved as a children’s activity, people of all ages can play and enjoy the game.Normally, all the players in Simon says remain standing for the duration of the playing round. However, you could also play sitting down.;
, Within your group of players, designate one person to be Simon. Whoever is chosen to be Simon will then stand in front of and face the rest of players in the group., Simon is the leader and commander of the group of listeners. Simon gives commands to the group of listeners. Simon’s commands can be given in two different ways: beginning a command by saying, “Simon says…” or simply stating the command.Simon’s goal is to eliminate as many listeners as possible, until there is one listener remaining as the winner.


Depending on which way the command is phrased, the group of listeners will either obey the command, or not. Simon eliminates listeners by having them incorrectly obey or not obey commands.

, Listeners must listen closely to what the leader, Simon, commands them to do. If Simon gives a command by first stating, “Simon says…” the listeners must obey Simon’s command.If Simon gives a command without first saying, “Simon says…” the listeners must not obey his command.If a listener incorrectly obeys or does not obey Simon’s command, they are eliminated from the rest of the game round, and must sit out until another game round is started.

, Because you are trying to eliminate as many listeners as you can, you should try and make your commands tricky to follow. For example, frequently switch up when you give commands preceded with, “Simon says…” Give your commands quickly so your listeners have to make quick decisions on whether to obey your command or not.When someone incorrectly obeys one of your (Simon’s commands), call them out so they can be eliminated from the remaining group of players still in the game. As Simon, you can get creative with your commands; however, some common commands Simon can give include:


Touch your toes.Hop on one foot.
Dance around the room.Do some jumping jacks.
Give yourself a hug., As a listener, you have to listen and pay attention very carefully to the commands given by Simon. Simon will try to trick you into obeying commands you shouldn’t by giving the commands very quickly.Wait a split second before you go to perform a command, to think back if Simon preceded the command by first saying, “Simon says…”


After Simon gives a command (assuming the command is preceded by, “Simon says…”), perform the command until Simon moves on to the next command.
If the next command is not preceded by, “Simon says…” continue to perform or hold the previous command.

, Keep playing until there is one remaining listener left.The remaining listener is the winner for the round, and becomes the new Simon. At the start of a new game round, all the eliminated players are back in the next game., This variation of the game involves the listeners counting their own personal strikes when they incorrectly obey or don’t obey a command. Simon can set a number of strikes (three strikes, five strikes, etc.), or strikes can be counted as letters of a word. Depending on the word, listeners who spell out the entire word are then out for the rest of the game round.For example, much like the basketball game Horse, strikes can spell out H-O-R-S-E. Once a player spells the entire word, they are eliminated., During holidays or certain festivities, the leader of the ground can change their name from Simon. For example, if you’re playing some time around Valentine's Day, Simon says can turn into Cupid says.If you’re playing around the Fourth of July, Simon can change into Uncle Sam says.

, “Simon says” can be translated into a fun activity for any sports team, especially teams that have older kids.A volleyball version of Simon says would include all volleyball related commands. For example, Simon might give commands like:


Block – All players jump up to block.
Dive – All players pretend to dive for a ball.
Defense – All players go into their defensive, ready position.Shuffle – All players would shuffle in the direction indicated by Simon.

, At the count of three, each player starts trying to remove the other player's sock in their pair.

, If anybody gets too rough, caution them.

Choose someone to be ""the fox"".,
Get close to 'the fox'.The aim of the game is to get to ""the fox"" without it seeing you.,
However, if ""the fox"" turns round, the other players must freeze in their position.,

The others go to the opposite side. Make sure the ""the fox"" is not facing the others.;
, When ""the fox"" isn't looking, the others must run or walk to get closer to the fox. Seems easy, doesn't it?

, If the fox sees them moving, the person/people who were moving go back to the start. Remember if you are seen moving, you must go back to the start even if you didn't think you've moved!

Personalize donkey tails.,
Mount the donkey image on a vertical surface, such as a wall.,
Mark your donkey.",How to Play Pin the Tail on the Donkey1," Pinning game kits are available for purchase in retail stores - specifically those that specialize in party materials.


The upside to buying a kit is that it may be more convenient and save time. Purchasing a full game kit, however, may also be more expensive and less personal than making one yourself.;
, For a cheaper option, hand draw a donkey on poster board. You may also consider printing your image from a computer.


Make the donkey at least 12 inches wide and 18 inches tall. Standard kit sizes average 18-24 inches x 24-30 inches., Use game preparation as a party activity. Allow the children to draw or decorate a group donkey.


Art activities help keep children engaged and entertained. Being the creators of the donkey makes it entirely ""their game.""
Drawing the donkey together may allow for bonding and insight into worldly perceptions and imagination., Have each player make and decorate his or her own donkey tail.


Use a variety of materials, such as string, paper, and ribbon. Get creative by adding beads or glitter as personal decoration.Write each player's name or initials somewhere on the tail. If labeling is not possible, make sure that the tails are unique enough to know who placed each one.
Push a pin through or attach adhesive tape to one end of the tail for pinning.

, Place the image at an appropriate height for all participants.Choose mounting equipment based on donkey durability and personal preference. Options include adhesive tape or putty, tacks, and push pins. Note that sharp tacks and pins may hold better but are more dangerous and will leave small holes.

, Draw an “X” on the picture where the tail would normally be placed, as a reference point for determining a ""winner."""

Allow everyone to have a turn.,
Determine which tail is ""best placed.""",How to Play Pin the Tail on the Donkey2," Use a dark colored cloth to thoroughly cover the participant’s eyes and prevent cheating. A colored bandanna works well.

, The player is spun in a stationary circle five to ten times. Slight disorientation adds humor and difficulty to the game.


Spin the player an appropriate number of times for his or her age. You may consider not spinning young children.
The objective is minor disorientation, not excessive dizziness., Hand the blindfolded player a tail and allow him or her to attempt sticking or pinning it over the ""X"" on the donkey's rear end.


Help the blindfolded player to face the image of the donkey before beginning to walk forward.
Consider leading smaller children to the donkey, to avoid potential injury., The remaining players are blindfolded, spun, and allowed to pin a tail, one-by-one.


Leave all of the donkey tails pinned to the location they have been placed, until every player has had a turn.
Use a pen or pencil to write player initials at each tail placement, as they are pinned. Initialing is only necessary if the players’ names or uniquely identifying decorations are not already on their tails., The ""winner"" is the player whose tail is closest to the marked ""X.""


Remind young children that the game is about having fun, stumbling around, and being silly. It is not about winning or losing.

"

Create a new version of the game.,
Make it a learning experience.,
Encourage team building.",How to Play Pin the Tail on the Donkey3," Pin the Tail on the Donkey is adaptable to fit the theme of virtually any birthday party or social gathering.


Search online to find examples of different pinning games, or create your own.
Play “Pin the Horn on the Unicorn” or “Pin the Eye on the Muno” (a monster character). Do not feel restricted to using the generic donkey., Note the importance of “hitting the mark,"" of precision, and of trial and error in daily living.


If a child is struggling to make accurate placement, encourage him or her. You might say, ""It can be difficult to get it right every time, but that is what practice is for. You keep getting better and better."" Or, ""It is just like in life: you practice to be good at this game, and I practice to be good at my job. We want to ""hit that mark"" so that we can be successful."" , Ask the children how they might work together to help make better placements.


If every player missed the mark you might suggest trying again but working together. Ask if it might be helpful to say ""no"" or ""cold"" when the pinner is off the mark, and ""warm"" when the pinner is close to the mark.

Use a small box if you want an even shape or to make it look larger than it is.
Wrap as many layers as players, with some to spare in case more players turn up.
The parcel should be large enough for at least a 5 minute game, so add more layers even when you have only a few players; it just means they get more turns.;
,, All the players should be seated comfortably and close enough to the person each side of them that they can pass the parcel quickly.

, This person will be responsible for turning the music on and off. It should be someone who is able to keep an eye on the players and stop the music in a fair way that allows everyone a turn at unwrapping. It is a little tricky because the music-keeper must be able to both see the players but at the same time, players should not be able to see the movements of the music-keeper getting ready to stop the music.

, The music-keeper plays the music and stops it when least expected.


The player holding the parcel unwraps a layer. If the parcel was midway in the air between exchanges, the parcel goes to the player it was being passed to.

Instead of a gift on each layer, you leave a label. The label should state ""For the person who..."". Add reasons such as: ""is wearing green"", ""has a pink ribbon"", ""likes penguins"", ""got an A in math this week"" etc. The labels should be more descriptive the better you know the children, and less descriptive for parties where you aren't very familiar with the children.


Colors, hairstyles, types of clothing and shoes are always a safe bet.
Read ""Tips"" for how to make this more fun for adults.

, This version does not require music. Rather, each player reads out the labels and everyone in the group has to guess who the parcel is meant for. The person who made the parcel should act as the umpire if there is any disagreement.


Everyone should still sit in a circle; it makes seeing each other a lot easier. If it's for adults, everyone can be seated on couches and chairs in a sort-of circular way around the room.

, The last unwrap is the winner; sometimes it can be nice to make sure that this goes to a particular person, such as the birthday girl/boy or the kid who never wins anything.

An activity example: Jump on one foot while clapping your hands over your head and sing the alphabet backwards. That's a good one for older children and adults; don't make the activities too difficult for young children or they'll lose interest.
Make enough layers and activities for at least two per person.
A bag of candies, balloons, plastic toys, etc. makes a good shareable choice.

, Pass the parcel around the circle while singing it, passing it as fast as possible.

, When the song ends, the player holding the parcel removes a layer and does the activity written underneath.

, The shared prize should be shared around by the last person to unwrap.

,
Start the quidditch!,
Continue playing until all pairs bar one from each team have been eliminated.",How to Play Quidditch World Cup," The more, the merrier and the longer the game will go for. Have them pair up in their team.;
, These two lines should be at least three metres apart. One of these lines should be designated the ""starting line"".

, Have each pair face one another. One person should stand at one line and the other player opposite on the other line. Make sure that the opposing pairs have sufficient space between them to try to avoid collisions during play.

,, The aim of the game is for each starter person to sweep the balloon to his or her team-mate opposite. The team-mate then takes the balloon and sweeps it back to the start line. The first one back is the winner and the other pair is eliminated.

, The final two pairs represent one team each and the winner of this gets the Quidditch trophy.

, Have them stand back to back. Each pair must connect by linking each other's pinky fingers.

, They must actually sit on the ground, linked the whole time, backsides touching the whole time.

, The same rules apply; they must stay linked by their pinkies the whole time, keeping their backsides together.

, Any pair who loses contact with either pinky fingers or backsides is automatically disqualified. The winners are the pairs who can do this without breaking. It's a lot harder than it sounds!

Assemble your ping pong ball and clear a space on the table.,
Position the player or teams.,
Decide on your ""end of race"" point.,
Allocate point values.,
Start blowing!",How to Play Ping Pong Races,";
, Depending on whether you have two children or pairs, stand each child or pair at opposite sides at the same end of the table.

, It's most fun to have it at the end of the table and then the ball is allowed to fall over the edge of the table end. Or, it can be placed somewhere earlier on the table and marked by a something unbreakable (such as a rubber duck) or by a line (such as a piece of yarn or a ribbon; tape it down). Ensure that the passage on either side of the table is clear of obstructions, so that the children do not hurt themselves while hurrying and blowing the ping pong ball along.

, As soon as the ball reaches its ""end of race"" point, the child or team should be awarded with a point. Decide how many races there will be to choose the winner. For instance, if you say there will be 5 races, then the child or team who reaches 3 points first is the overall winner of the ping pong races.

, Players can blow with their mouths but they are not allowed to touch the ping pong ball with their hand, chin, elbow or any other part of their body. As soon as a ball falls off the table (except when it reaches the end), the turn is lost and the other side can have a turn. You can add a variation and let the children blow with straws but the straws must not touch the ping pong ball or they're disqualified.

Have two of the players join hands, facing each other.,
Grab the player passing through.,
Keep it quiet.,
Continue.",How to Play Oranges and Lemons," They need to have agreed privately which is to be ""Oranges"" and which ""Lemons."" The rest of the party forms a long line, standing one behind the other, and holding each other's dresses or coats. The first two raise their hands so as to form an arch, and the rest run through it, singing the rhyme set out above as they run.;
, At the word ""head"" the hand archway descends, and clasps the player passing through at that moment; he/she is then asked in a whisper, ""Oranges or Lemons?"" and if he/she chooses ""oranges,"" he/she is told to go behind the player who has agreed to be ""oranges"" and clasp him/her round the waist.

, The players must be careful to speak in a whisper, so that the others do not know what has been said.

, The game then goes on again, in the same way, until all the children have been caught and have chosen which they will be, ""oranges"" or ""lemons."" When this happens, the two sides prepare for a tug-of-war. Each child clasps the one in front of him/her tightly and the two leaders pull with all their might, until one side has drawn the other across a line which has been drawn between them.

Sit down or swap places.,
Play again.",How to Play Heads Down Thumbs Up1," This game is best played in a classroom with desks., The volunteers should come to the front of the room., Tell everyone who is not one of the selected volunteers to rest their heads on the table. They should also be told to close their eyes tightly and raise one thumb up.

, They are to choose one person and press down on that person's thumb (turn that person's thumbs up to a thumbs down). They then return to the front of the room.One volunteer can only press one person's thumb down. This means that in total there should now be seven individuals with thumbs down, while the rest of the room still has their thumbs up.
Volunteers should be as quiet as possible so as to confuse those with their heads down., Ask those whose thumbs have been turned down to guess which volunteer touched them.Children who go guess after others who have guessed generally have an advantage, especially if one or more volunteers have been correctly eliminated. To make the game fair, the teacher can change up how the seven selected individuals are called upon to guess the person who touched their thumbs (e.g., call students front-to-back, left-to right, or in alphabetical order, etc.).

, Students who guess wrong remain seated. Students who correctly guess who pressed their thumbs swap places with those volunteers and go to the front.

, The game can last as long as you like. Because it's short, you can repeat it as many times as you want!

Tell the participants to not ask for slow songs since it's difficult to dance to. Use upbeat music, such as pop and rap, or you could use upbeat nursery rhymes songs for small children.

Play music that is age appropriate; obviously you shouldn't play songs with inappropriate messages and language for small children and you shouldn't play childish songs for teenagers and older children.;
, You'll need some kind of media player: a computer or device with music on it, a CD player, speakers, etc. You can also use a phone, search for or download some upbeat tunes, and place the phone in a plastic cup to use as a speaker., Ask everyone if they want to play. You can have as many players as you want; with too many, however, it may get out of hand and the game will be too long., If someone doesn't want to participate, they can help out with the music, or if everyone wants to participate, take turns being in charge., Place the media player or phone on a table so it doesn't get knocked over. You can also set up a chair beside the table for the person in charge if they don't want to stand the whole time., Have everyone spread out to prevent injuries. Tell the players to not run around or do anything crazy such as doing flips since someone could get hurt which is no fun!, Begin the game by starting the music, during this time everyone has to dance and move., When the music stops everyone has to freeze. Don't remind them to freeze as this will make the game too easy. Try to trick the players by playing the music and stopping it really quickly., When the music stops playing and someone moves the they're out of the game. Kick out players if they fall or if they're being way too silly; yes it's okay to have fun, but if they almost hurt or injure some while dancing they should be eliminated., Keep playing and stopping the music until the last person, to win you have to be the last one standing., Congratulate the winner with a special prize. The winner gets to be in charge the next round, if everyone wants to play again., Each time you stop the music, before you start playing the music again tell everyone to dance or move a certain way such as:

Dance like a ballerina
Hop like a frog
Do the disco
Breakdance
Hop like a bunny
Dance like Micheal Jackson or other famous people that dance
Do the salsa
Tango dance
Ballroom dance

, The person in charge can tell the players to freeze in a different position each round. If a play forgets to freeze or doesn't freeze in the proper position they are out. Possible positions include:

Freeze like a statue
Freeze like a model
Freeze like a certain animal
Freeze like a superhero
Freeze like a certain shape
Freeze like a dancer
Freeze like a bug
Freeze like a letter

, The person in charge can tell the players to make a silly face while dancing each round to add some humour to the game. If a player forgets to make a face or still has a silly face when the music stops they're out. Use faces such as:

Making a monkey face
Bulging out your eyes
Doing a creepy smile
Doing the fish face
Doing a sad face
Doing an angry face
Doing an exited face
Doing a shocked face

, The person in charge can have the players make funny noises each round. If a player doesn't stop making noises when the music stops or they forget to make a noise they're out. Use noises such as:

Snorting like a pig
Barking like a dog
Making slurp sounds
Whistling
Singing out of tune
Moo like a cow
Quack like a duck
Let them be creative by letting them choose

, The person in charge can have the players sing or hum the lyrics of the song being played. If a players forgets to sing or continues to sing when the music stops they're out., Spice up the game by playing different tunes each round since hearing the same song can get boring pretty fast. For example, if you tell the players to dance like a ballerina, play some ballet songs such as the Nutcracker, or the Sugar Plum Fairy., When someone gets kicked out of the game, have a punishment ready for them, such as:

Eating something gross
Doing something embarrassing
Wearing something embarrassing
Wearing layers of clothing
Getting tickled by someone (if they hate getting tickled)
Eating something sour or spicy
Pour something on their head (water, juice, etc.)

, Everyone will be having a blast and want to play more rounds."

Choose seven students.,
Have the pickers choose one student each.,
Have your pickers say, “Heads up, seven up!” When the pickers say the name of the game in unison, the other students will open their eyes and lift their heads.,
Switch your pickers.",How to Play Heads Up 7 Up1," Have the students stand in the front of the class. These students will be the pickers. Have the rest of the students put their heads down with their hands outstretched on their desks and their thumbs up. Have the students at their desks close their eyes and tell them that there is no peeking allowed.If you have students who tend to disrupt class or have trouble focusing, you may want to choose them to pick first. They’re more likely to get involved in the game if they feel like they’re your “helpers”.
You can also have the students at the desk put their outstretched closed fist on the table without their thumb up. The important thing is that their hands are easily accessible to the pickers.;
, The pickers should walk around the classroom and each tap the thumb of a student with his or her head down. When a student’s thumb is tapped, that student puts their thumb down signaling to the rest of the pickers that he has already been picked.


Children can only be picked once in a round. If the students have their thumbs down to begin with, they will put their thumb up when they are picked.
Make sure the pickers are silent as they move around the room. They don’t want the student that they pick to recognize their voice.

, Let the students who were picked take turns guessing who picked them.Trying to decide who picked them is good for a student’s reasoning skills. They can analyze all the pickers to see which one looks “guilty.”
Students may at first think they were picked by their friends but be surprised that someone else has picked them.

, If a student guesses who picked them correctly, that student will be a picker in the next round. If the student guesses incorrectly, then the child who picked them will remain a picker in the next round. Make sure the pickers don’t give away who they have chosen until all the students have made their guesses.

Finished.

",How to Make a Paper Crossbow," The rubber bands should form a chain roughly 9 inches (23 cm) long when strung together, so you need to make sure that the rubber bands you choose are long enough.


If you make them too much longer, however, you may not be able to build up enough force to fling an object across the room when you pull the ""string"" of the crossbow back.
You could also use elastic hair ties or other stretchy bands for this part of the crossbow.;
, Feed one rubber band through the loop of a second. Simultaneously feed that second rubber band through the loop of the first.Pull the two rubber bands in opposite directions to form a knot.
Make sure that this knot is tight and secure.

, Feed the third rubber band through the loop of the first at the end opposite that of the second band. Simultaneously feed the first rubber band through the loop of the third.


Pull the bands in opposite directions once more to add this third portion.
Your string is not ready. Set it aside until the time comes to attach it to the crossbow.

, Roll the sheet into a tight tube, working from long end to long end.


Use clear tape to secure the tube. Tape up the ends by wrapping the tape all the way around the tube at both ends. For added support, you can even tape the open side of the tube down the entire length.






Make sure that the tube is as tight and evenly rolled as possible.







, Roll four separate sheets of printer paper into four separate tubes, working from long end.


Again, you should secure the tubes by taping up the ends and open side, and make sure that the tube is as tight and evenly rolled as possible.

, The first two tubes must be taped together at a perpendicular angle. Line one tube up so that the top end meets the center of the second tube. Secure in place with tape.Wrap the tape around the two tubes at a diagonal so that each piece of tape crosses over both tubes. Work from both perpendicular corners, essentially creating an ""x"" shape with the tape.
You might need a lot of tape to fix the two tubes together. Use as much as you need to ensure that the two tubes are firmly attached and not wiggling around, as this bond needs to be steady for your crossbow to hold together.

, Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut a third paper tube in two even halves.


If necessary, use more tape to prevent the newly cut ends from unrolling.

, Place each half on either side of the ""T"" created by your crossbow body. Each half should extend from the vertical tube to the horizontal tube at a diagonal. Tape it all together.


The halves should be just above the center of the vertical tube and not quite at the end of the horizontal tube.
Try to keep both halves symmetrical when you attach them.

, Line up the end of a fourth tube so that it matches the bottom end of your vertical tube. Securely wrap it with tape to lengthen the body of your crossbow.


Use duct tape or masking tape for a stronger hold. Otherwise, wrap normal tape around it multiple times to keep it steady and secure.







, The two halves should be about even, but make sure that at least one half is long enough to extend from the top of your vertical tube down to the point at which the vertical tube meets with the two diagonal supports.

, Line one half up with the top of your vertical tube so that it extends from the top down to the diagonal supports. Fix it securely to the vertical tube with masking tape or multiple layers of normal tape.


This tube will help guide your ammo and make your shots more accurate.

, Flip your crossbow over to the bottom. Stand the remaining half on the vertical tube, in between the horizontal bar and the ends of the diagonal supports. And tape it in place securely.


This half will act as a handle for your crossbow.
If desired, trim it down to size so that the handle comfortably fits your grip.

, Roll the sheet into a tight tube, working from long end to long end, and use clear tape to secure the ends and side of the tube.


This new tube will be used for the shoulder stock.

, Use sharp scissors to cut the new paper tube in half. One half should be 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) longer than the other half.

, With the crossbow still facing upside down, stand the shorter half of your new tube up on the top of the vertical portion of the body, near the bottom. Tape in place securely, making sure that it does not wiggle or move around.


This half should be placed about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the bottom of the vertical tube.

, Roll up another sheet of paper into a tight tube, working from long end to long end, and use clear tape to secure the ends and side of the tube.


This new tube will be used to give your shoulder stock more support.

, Position one end of this new tube near the top of the upright post. Angle it downward so that it reaches the long body of the crossbow, meeting it at about the same place where the two halves of the long body come together. Tape in place.


Note that the end of this new diagonal support will be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of the upright paper post.
At this point, you should be able to stand the crossbow up on its handle and the shoulder stock, and it should remain standing without little to no support from you. If this is not the case, identify the weak point of the crossbow and strengthen it with more tape.

, Stretch the rubber band string so that one end loops around one side of the horizontal bar and the other end loops around the other side of the same bar. It should be taut against the front of your paper crossbow.


Use tape to secure the ends of the rubber band string in place.






You can also use tape to tape up the center of this band. Doing so will make it easier for you to launch projectiles.







, Tape a spring-action clothespin to the top of the long body of the crossbow. It should be positioned just before the joining of the two body halves.


Make sure that the clothespin is in the right place by pulling back the rubber band string. The band should be able to stretch back comfortably without bending your crossbow. Take it as far back as possible for this to be true, and make sure that the opening of your clothespin falls out at this spot.

, To give your crossbow more support, consider wrapping the entire thing up with masking tape or duct tape.

, Insert a pencil into the guide tube on top of the crossbow body.


The point should face outward, toward the front of the crossbow, and the back should stick out from the bottom of this tube, toward the back of the crossbow.

, Pull the rubber band string back and clip it in place using the clothespin.


The band should be behind the pencil projectile, but at the moment, it should be completely stilled and secured by the clothespin.

, Shift the bottom of the pencil projectile down so that it lies flush against the top of the clothespin.


This action will make it easier for the rubber band to strike the projectile accurately once it is released.

, Hold your paper crossbow up with the front facing your target. Press on the back of the clothespin to open it and release the rubber band, thereby sending the pencil projectile flying toward your target.


The force of your band should be enough to send the projectile flying forward.
With this step, the process is complete.

Instruct all the children to put their heads down and close their eyes.,
Select six more students.,
Let the children guess who is “it” Give the students at their desks a chance to examine the seven students in the front of the class.,
Start the next round.",How to Play Heads Up 7 Up2," Make sure the children have their fists outstretched on their tables where they can be easily reached. As the teacher, walk around the classroom and tap one child on the hand. That child will be “it.”


Make sure the child who is “it” does not talk after you have chosen them. You don’t want them to give away their identity to the rest of the class.
You can encourage the kids to behave by saying things like, “I’m only going to choose a student who is being quiet and following all the rules.”

, The student who is “it” will walk around the room and tap six other students on the hand. When a student is picked, that student will get up from their seat and walk to the front of the class. After everyone has chosen, the students in the front of the class will say, “Heads up, seven up!” and all the students at their desks will lift their heads up and open their eyes., Tell them to raise their hands if they think they know which student is “it.” Select one student at a time, and let them tell you their guess. Keep selecting students until someone gets the answer right.


Suspense will build as students are ruled out from being ""it"" by process of elimination. Be ready to calm your students down if they get overexcited.
You can make the game more fun for the kids by giving a prize to the child that guesses correctly. Let the winner choose one item from a bag filled with assorted candy or small items like pencils and erasers.

, Heads up, seven up is a very popular game and your students will likely want to play it several time. Try to play quite a few rounds so that everyone has chance to participate. Keep track of the children you have already chosen to be “it.” Try to give as many kids a chance to be “it” as you possibly can.


You can also use the game as a reward for good behavior.
Say things like, “If everyone is good today, we’ll play heads up, seven up for the last thirty minutes of class.”

Spell a word.,
Work on grammar.,
Solve a math problem.,
Ask a science question.",How to Play Heads Up 7 Up3," Play a normal game of heads up, seven up. However, instead of having the children identify who picked them, have the children spell a word. If the child spells the word correctly, then they get to be a picker for the next round. If they spell the word incorrectly, the picker remains the same.Be sure to use words that are appropriate for your students level of education.
Make sure to use the same word until one of the students gets it right so all the other students can hear it spelled correctly.
You can write the word on the board or projector after the students have spelled it to give your students a chance to review.
You can also have all the students spell the word in unison after it is used.

, If you’re an English teacher, you can make the game more relevant to your class by having the children use proper grammar. For example: Instead of just blurting out a name, have children ask, “Was it Anne?” Then Anne can reply, “Yes, it was me.”You can even have your students write their guesses on the board to work on their written grammar.
Writing down their guesses can help your students learn how to write in complete sentences, when to use a question mark, and how to capitalize words.

, Have students who are picked answer a question about the math lesson that they’re currently learning. If your students are learning their multiplication tables, you might ask a question like “What is five times nine?” If the student gets the answer wrong, ask the next student the same question. If the student gets the answer right, they will be a picker for the next round. Either way, make sure to review the answer clearly to everyone in the class.Use questions with the appropriate difficulty level. You don’t want your kids to be bored with a bunch of easy questions, but you also don’t want them to be discouraged by questions that are too difficult.
Repeat the rule that corresponds to each question after it is used. For example: For the question, “What is nine times five?” the answer would be forty-five. Say, “Remember that whenever a number is multiplied by five, the answer ends in five or zero.”

, Test your kid's knowledge of science. For example, If your students are learning about the periodic table of elements ask something like, “What do the letters 'Fe' stand for on the periodic table?” If the student answers “Iron,” allow them to be a picker for the next round.


The game might run smoother if you write your questions on pieces of paper and place them in a hat. Let your students choose a question from the hat to answer when they are picked.

, Put the bottlecap down on the table, with its top upward. Stick a flathead screwdriver through the vertical side, under the bottlecap, and through the other side. This pair of holes should be very close to the lower rim.


Make the holes wide enough to fit a popsicle stick.

, Rotate the cap 90º. The holes will now be on the left and right. The side in front of you will have no holes in it.

, Push the screwdriver through in this direction to make holes at a 90º angle to the others. These holes will be halfway up the cap's sides. Leave room below and above them.


These should also be wide enough to fit a popsicle stick.

, One popsicle stick goes through the two lowest holes, just poking out one end. A second stick goes through the middle holes, poking out equally on each sides. Now you have a † shape through the bottle cap.

, Keep the cap pointed the same direction. Poke the screwdriver high up on the sides, near the flat top. Make these holes small, and keep them straight over the lower stick. You can use a larger, Philips head screwdriver to make the holes round without making them wider.

, Take a wide rubber band. Place it over the bottle cap, above the sticks. Hold it against the top of the †. Pull the lower end over the left arm, then the right. Repeat until the rubber band is mostly tight.

, Pull the rubber band down over the top of the bottlecap. Take the cotton off one end of a cotton swab. Stick the swab through the top pair of holes, starting at the top of the †. Pull back on the rubber band and let go to fire.


If the rubber band doesn't pull far enough, unwrap it once from the arms.
If the cotton swab won't fit (without the cotton ball end), make the hole larger with a screwdriver.

, Pull the rubber band back as far as it can easily go. Mark that spot on the stick with a pen. Push a thumbtack just in front of that spot. You can now keep the rubber band ""locked"" by stretching it over the thumbtack. To shoot, pull out the tack or pull up the rubber band and let go.


The rubber band will wear out fast if you keep it locked. Unhook the band any time you aren't using the crossbow.

Enjoy your finished lightsaber.",How to Make a Lightsaber Hilt out of a Recycled Paper Towel Tube," The handle of most lightsabers is usually round with a single energy blade coming out of one end, though specialty lightsabers, like the one used by Darth Maul, also exist.To mimic the round shape, you're going to decorate an empty roll of paper towel. All in all, you're going to need:


Belt
Binder clip (1)
Duct tape (red, gray, and black)
Cardboard tube (i.e. - a paper towel tube or wrapping paper tube)
Marker
Scissors
Square Lego (2 studs by 2 studs; 1 piece);
, Take your empty roll of paper towel and hold it in your hand by its end, or give it to the person who will be using the pretend lightsaber. Your fingers should curl around the side of the tube and your thumb should lie along the topside of it.The total length of your hilt should be about the same as the distance between your wrist and elbow.Younger children with smaller hands might find that smaller rolls of cardboard, like a toilet paper roll, fit their hand better. You could trim your paper towel roll to an appropriate size with your scissors.
If you make your lightsaber too small, you run the risk of it being missed by the people who see your costume. This can leave them confused as to what your costume is. A clearly visible lightsaber hilt at your side will mark you as a trained Jedi.

, The main color of most lightsaber handles is gray, so you should use gray duct tape to cover your cardboard tube completely. This will make your lightsaber appear like it's made of metal. When your tube is covered from top to bottom, use your scissors to cut the tape free of the roll and smooth the loose end to your hilt.Wind your tape around the tube smoothly and evenly. Air bubbles or bunched up tape will make your lightsaber look less realistic. You can prevent these by smoothing the tape with one hand while winding it around your tube with the other.

, In the Star Wars movies, TV shows, and comics, there are many small accents on lightsabers. These give your lightsaber a more complex appearance. The colors used for lightsaber accents are most typically blacks, grays, and golds.Tear or cut off two 5–10 inch (12.7–25.4 cm) pieces of the black duct tape. These black pieces will be used to give your hilt a hand grip. Stick the tape to the edge of a table so you can get it easily when you need it.

, First you'll need to cut a strip of duct tape (any color) ½ inch thick and 1 inch long (1.27 cm wide by 2.54 cm long). Then roll this strip of duct tape tightly so that the sticky side is facing out. Your rolled duct tape should be small enough to hide under your Lego piece.Stick the rolled, outside-sticky piece of tape to the bottom of your Lego piece. It will eventually become your on button. For now, you can stick it out of the way with your accent strips.
Since the classic lightsaber design uses many metallic and base colors, like black, gold, and gray, you should consider using a colorful Lego block to give your lightsaber some character. Blue and red are popular choices.

, Around the bottom of your lightsaber, you're going to wrap your two black accent strips. You can do this in whatever way you find most appropriate - as a Jedi you should have a natural intuition for the placement of your lightsaber hand grip. Wind your accent strips completely around the hilt until they are smoothly attached.


You might overlap both strips to create one large grip, or you might break up the strips so there's a small space between. You could even spread out the bottom part of the grip so it's wider than the top.
If you don't have black duct tape, you can substitute black electrical tape. If electrical tape is unavailable, you can color clear scotch tape black with your marker and use that instead.

, Now that your grip is done, you can place the switch for your lightsaber accordingly. You can place your on switch wherever you please, but the most realistic placement will be close to the hand grip. This way, you can easily turn your lightsaber ""on"" and ""off"" while holding it.The Lego on/off switch for your lightsaber is only there to make it look more realistic. Pressing it will not have an effect on your lightsaber.
If you have split your hand grip so there is a small space between the upper and lower part of your grip, you might want to put your on/off switch there. You could also place it above or below your grip.

, Any color of duct tape will work for closing off the open end at the bottom of your lightsaber. A vibrant color, like red or blue, will give it a dash of character. Cut a strip of duct tape with you scissors wide enough to cover the hole, then cover the hole with the tape. Then you should tuck the sides of the tape to lie as flat as possible against the sides of your lightsaber.


Because the bottom of your lightsaber is round, your tape might bunch when tucking the sides down. You can cover this up with another piece of gray duct tape around the cylindrical part of the bottom. This extra piece of gray tape will also help hold your bottom cover in place.
You might want to use two strips of duct tape to close off the open end. This way you can use one piece to cover half of the hole and the other piece to close it off completely. The extra tape on either side will be easier to tuck down to the sides of the lightsaber.

, Luke Skywalker is frequently seen with his trusty lightsaber at his hip. If you want to look like a real Jedi, you'll need to make a belt clip of your own. Cut a 3 - 5 inch (7.62 - 12.7 cm) strip of duct tape in half lengthwise and stick it out somewhere out of the way but close at hand. Then:Hold a binder clip flat to the side of your lightsaber toward the bottom of the hilt.
Position the binder clip so it's open side is facing the top of the lightsaber.
Orient the silver ""wings"" of your binder clip to bend away from its mouth. The inside wing should run mostly flat along the side of your lightsaber.
Fasten your binder clip in place with your strip of tape.
You could also use a string, hook, or Velcro strap to make your belt clip. A loop of cord tied to your lightsaber and a carabiner on a belt loop would also work well., Since the lightsaber is an imaginary weapon, you could add any features that you see fit. For example, you might add a small red duct tape square next to your on/off switch and call it your self-destruct switch. You could also add tiny black buttons for your lightsaber power settings.


Evil Jedi called the Sith prefer to use red lightsabers and red accents on their weapons. This is because Sith masters have an aggressive view of the force, which is represented by red.Good Jedi can have lightsabers many different colors. You might choose the color for your imaginary lightsaber and then use this color in your accents., Put your belt around your waist and clasp it around your front. Now that your lightsaber is mostly done, you'll need to check your belt and belt clip. After all, you don't want to run into a Sith lord and not be able to get your weapon free! Once your belt is on, press the metal wings to open the mouth of your binder clip and clip it onto your belt.

, Now that your lightsaber is done, you can create your own Star Wars character and dress like a Jedi Knight. Armed with your trusty lightsaber and with the Force on your side, you'll be ready to face anything!

Finished.

",How to Make a Mini Crossbow3," Start with a rectangular piece of scrap lumber, with 1"" x 2"" dimensions or smaller (20 x 40 mm). It should be about 8–9 inches (20–23 cm) long. You'll also need five short screws, small enough to drill through a popsicle stick.

, Take three popsicle sticks, each one a standard 4½ inches (11.5 cm) long. Drill three holes in each popsicle stick, the size of your small screws.


One hole near one end.
One hole near the other end.
One hole in the exact middle.

, Drill two holes on the same surface of the lumber, without drilling through the wood. Place the holes ½ inch (2.5 cm) from the same short end, in line with each other.


These holes should match the size of the screws.

, Fasten a screw through the hole at the end of a popsicle stick, and into one of the holes in your stick. Repeat with a second popsicle stick on the other side. These are your crossbow arms.

, Cut your last popsicle stick into two pieces, exactly through the central hole. Use a small handsaw or a serrated knife, to make sure the cut is even.

, Place a half-stick over one of the crossbow arms. Line them up so the full hole on the half-stick is over the center hole on the arm. Screw them together. Repeat with the other half-stick on the other side.

, Add these in line with the screws holding the crossbow arms, so you have four holes in a square pattern. Place them ¾ in (1.9 cm) away from the other holes.

, Fasten a screw about halfway into one of the new holes. Move one of the crossbow arms, so the half-stick touches the screw. The half-hole in the half-stick should rest around the screw. Repeat with a screw on the other side.


Don't tighten these screws all the way. This lets you place the crossbow arms in a sturdy position for firing, then shift the arms and fold them against the lumber.

, Take a long rubber band. Fit one end through the hole in the tip of the right crossbow arm. Wrap it around the tip once or twice to fasten it. Stretch the other end of the band to the left crossbow arm and repeat on the other side.

, Pull the rubber band back so it's taut, as though you were going to shoot it. Don't pull it back as far as it will go, or it will break after a few uses. Mark this spot on the lumber. Use a handsaw to make a notch across the lumber at this spot. You can keep the rubber band in this notch to make it ready for firing.


You may still need to hold your thumb over this notch, especially if the notch isn't deep or the rubber band is very stretched.

, Use a round file to make a groove in the lumber. Run it back and forth along the wood, from the firing tip to the notch. Go slow at first to make sure it stays in the center. Repeat until it's worn down into a deep groove. You can now fire wooden dowels out of your crossbow.

Create notches in the popsicle stick.,
Soak the popsicle stick.,
Shape the popsicle stick into a bow.,
String the bow.,
Make Q-tip arrows.",How to Make a Homemade Bow2," Retrieve your popsicle stick and a sharp knife. Use the knife to create 2 small parallel notches (one on each side) on each end of the popsicle stick. Each notch should be approximately 2 mm long. Place the notches ½ inch from the end.Ask a parent to help you cut the notches in the popsicle stick.

, In order to bend the popsicle stick without breaking it, you must soften the wood. Fill a bowl with water. Place the popsicle stick in the bowl of water. Allow the popsicle stick to soak for 1 to 2 hours.It is better to over soak the popsicle stick than to under soak it.

, Remove the popsicle stick from the bowl of water. Starting at the center of the popsicle stick, gently bend the bow into a “C” with your fingers. Continue to curve the popsicle stick until it resembles a bow., Wrap the dental floss several times around the notches on the top of the popsicle stick. Bring the dental floss down the length of the bow on its left side to the bottom. Wrap the dental floss several times around bottom notches. Bring the dental floss up the length of the bow on its right side to the top notches. Wrap the dental floss several times around the top notches. Tie the dental floss in a knot.


You may place a dab of hot glue on the knot to prevent it from untying., Retrieve several q-tips, a nail clipper, and a sharp knife. Use the nail clippers to cut off one end of the Q-tip just about the cotton swab.Cut a small slit in the bottom of the arrow with a sharp knife."

Cut the PVC Pipe.,
Cut two notches into the PVC Pipe.,
Prepare the nylon rope.,
String the bow.,
Create a hand grip.,
Create arrows.",How to Make a Homemade Bow3," The ½ inch PVC pipe is sold in 10 foot sections. Use a measuring tape and permanent marker to divide the pipe into three 40 inch sections. Cut the pipe into three equal sections with a hacksaw or fine tooth jigsaw., Use your saw to cut a notch 1 inch in length into the top of the pipe. Flip the PVC pipe over. Cut a second 1 inch long notch on the opposite end of the PVC Pipe in alignment with the first notch., Tie a knot in one end the nylon rope. The knot should be thick enough so that it will not slip through the notch you created. Burn the end of the knot with a lighter to prevent the rope from fraying., The process of stringing the bow requires a bit of patience and some muscle.


Insert the rope into the top notch so that the knot is situated inside the pipe.
Pull the string tightly down the length of the bow.
Cut the rope 5 inches beyond the bottom of the pipe.
Tie a knot in the rope approximately 4 ½ inches from the end and burn the ends. Like the first knot, the second knot should be thick enough so that it does not slip through the notch.
Bend the pipe and slide the rope into the bottom notch so that the knot is situated inside the pipe.
Wrap a piece of duct tape around each end of the bow to prevent the string from moving., Place the 6 inch piece of pipe foam around the PVC pipe at its center. Bring together the two edges of the pipe foam. Place a zip tie over each end of the pipe foam to secure it in place. Cut the ends off of the zip tie with a pair of scissors., To create arrows, you will need dowels, 2 inch thick home insulation foam, a hot glue gun, and a knife.


Use a sharp knife to create 3 inch x 3 inch triangles out of the 2 inch home insulation foam.
Insert the dowel into the center of one of the triangle’s three sides.
Remove the dowel, coat the end with hot glue, and reinsert the dowel into the foam arrow head.
Slit the end of the dowel with a sharp knife. The slit makes it easier to string the arrow."

",How to Make a Small Crossbow out of Household Items," Repeat with two more pencils.






;
, Again, leave the last centimeter of each end uncovered. Tape the pen pairs into a “t,” still leaving the ends uncovered.








, Unscrew if necessary and remove all mechanisms including the ink cartridge, springs, and/or tips. (Save the ink cartridge because that will be used as the ammo later.) When you’re done, you should end up with a hollow tube. Dissemble the pen. Save the tub and ink cartridge.








, Line the tube up with the top of the “t” and tape into place.








, Anchor the rubber band by sliding it into the gap between the pencils on either side of the crossbar of the “t.” Stretch a rubber band over the crossbar of the “t,” wedging it between the pencils on either side.








, This will be the cradle from which you launch the ink cartridge. Be sure not to tape the rubber band to the crossbow itself. Use tape to make a cradle in the center of the rubber bands.








, (The loading end is the one where the tube doesn’t line up with the end of the crossbow.) This adds elevation, which will come in handy later. Wrap a rubber band around the pencils beneath the loading end of the tube.








, If it goes in too far, simply tilt the crossbow to slide it back out. Load the ink cartridge.








, Be sure to stretch it to the loading end, not the shooting end. Stretch the rubber ban back towards the loading end.








, Note that if the ink cartridge is still full, you might actually draw on whatever you shoot at.








, Hope you have fun shooting.

, Roll the paper into a ball by grabbing it between the thumb, index finger, and middle finger of both hands. Push all your fingers together with the paper in the middle. Keep doing that until the piece of paper is a small ball.

, If you don’t have much spit in your mouth, now is a good time to take a drink. You want to make sure you have enough spit to soak your spitball completely. Sometimes it helps to chew on it a little to make sure the spit covers the whole thing., Now that you’ve soaked your spitball, you can launch it with your weapon of choice.


If you’re spitting it from your mouth or blowing it through a straw you don’t need to remove it from your mouth. Just launch.
If your weapon is to throw it, take it out of your mouth first. Once you’ve soaked your spitball with spit, you can take it out of your mouth and launch.

, Your smaller pieces don’t have to be an exact size, but keep in mind you’ll be putting more than one layer onto your spitballs so make two sizes (one large enough to fit over a smaller ball).

, To do this, grab the paper between your thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Squeeze your fingers together with the paper in the middle. Keep doing that until the piece of paper is a small ball.

, You want to make sure you have enough spit in your mouth to soak your spitball. Take a drink to wet your mouth.

, Move the spitball around in your mouth to make sure it’s covered in spit. It can help to chew on it a little to make sure spit gets onto the whole thing.

, Once your spitball is completely covered in spit you can take it out of your mouth.

, Make sure you grab one of the larger pieces you ripped from your two pieces of paper. Wrap it around your soaked spitball. Push down with your fingers until the spitball becomes a larger ball.

, You need to have a lot of saliva ready to soak that spitball all the way through. Take a big drink, swish it around in your mouth, and swallow.

, Now that you have enough saliva to wet your new layer, put the larger spitball back in your mouth and keep it in there long enough to soak the entire thing.

, Once you’ve soaked your spitball, take it out of your mouth and get ready to either throw it with your fingers, or flick it with your fingers or a ruler. It should be big enough to fly pretty far.

, This method works with either single-layered or multi-layered spitballs. Multi-layered spitballs will usually travel farther.


Put the spitball between your thumb and middle finger, pull your arm back, aim, and throw.

, This method works best with single-layered spitballs because they’re easier to spit out. Place the spitball between your lips, take in a deep breath, and blow as hard as you can. The spitball should pop out from between your lips, straight at your target.


You might need to be standing close to your target for this launching method to work.

, This is another method that works best with single-layered spitballs because they fit better in a straw. You can also use a pen for this method.Put your spitball inside of a straw, pushing it in as far as you can.
Take a deep breath and put your mouth on the straw so no air can get in.
Blow as hard as you can.
Your spitball should pop out of the other side of the straw, right at your target.

, This method works best with multi-layered spitballs because you get more velocity.


Curl your middle finger into your thumb to form a circle, so that the nail of your finger is touching your thumb. Press them together so there is tension between your fingers.
Put the spitball in the spot where your middle finger meets your thumb. Right between them, on the outside of your middle finger.
Push your middle finger out, away from your thumb. This should make the spitball fling up and out, toward your target.

, Berries, fruit, fish, nuts, rodents, and small birds are common foods. Maybe this animal eats only one type of food, like the koala. This should help determine where the animal will live.

, Where would this animal live, and where would it make its den? The animal's diet will also play a part in this - if your animal eats fish, they'll need to live near ponds, lakes, or oceans. What regions of the world would this animal live in? Climate? These are all important factors.

, You can either come up with your own name, or, if you made a mix of animals, merge their Latin names together. For creating your own name from scratch, try taking random words that fit your animal (like ""brown"", ""grey"", ""fur"", etc.) in another language and switching around the letters a bit to make a good name.

, An avatar is the character that you will use to represent yourself as you move through the virtual world.Many sites allow you to customize your avatar, changing things like hairstyle, eye color, skin color, and gender, as well as clothing. Some sites, like Second Life, allow you to choose vampires as well as people!Some people choose avatars that are very similar to themselves. Others decide it would be more interesting to change genders, races, or other attributes.
It’s really up to you (and the site you choose) when it comes to how far you want to make your avatar deviate from yourself. Some avatars are more cartoonish, such as WeeWorld, and others are more sophisticated looking., Once you have an avatar, it’s time to explore the virtual world that you have chosen. Figure out what the virtual world allows you or requires you to do. You will need to figure out the specific controls to move your avatar.


Learn the rules of the specific game by reading the materials provided before you enter the virtual world. For example, many virtual world games provide frequently asked questions and other instructional materials. In some games, you simply use keys on your computer keyboard to move the avatar and can choose functions that enable your avatar to run, walk, fly or teleport into a new world.
Spend some time getting to know the virtual world before you change anything in it. Figure out how it works, and go on a journey to see what’s in it! Some virtual worlds, like those in WeeWorld, allow you to play games. Some virtual worlds even have a space within the simulated environment where you can go and ask questions about using the virtual world.
In real life, you would want to scope out and acclimate to your environment before changing anything in it. The same is true in a virtual world. Virtual World.com is an example of an online game that allows you to visit a main street, beach, saloon, and skatepark, among other environments., Some virtual worlds allow you to interact with other users. Some sites, like Second Life, allow voice as well as text chatting with other users.


You will see a text chat box pop up with the usernames of other people currently in the world. People have made virtual friends through such worlds. Some people feel more confident in virtual worlds because they are shy in real life. Some virtual worlds also provide maps that show you who else is in the world and where to find them.
Follow the rules set by the virtual world game for interaction with others. Always be respectful. Just because it’s a virtual world doesn’t mean you can do anything you want. Sometimes circles of friends will chat with other friends in virtual worlds but they know who each other is outside of the simulated environment.
Be aware that some people who have taken such interactions off line have found themselves in danger or meeting someone who was not what they imagined. Always be cautious when meeting people online.

, Different virtual worlds will have different rules for navigation. You may be able to approach other avatars and interact with them.


Figure out how you are supposed to move the avatar and where you are allowed to go.
You may need to perform tasks or pay money to access different levels of the virtual world. You are usually able to travel through different virtual worlds.
Some virtual worlds will show you a map to help you figure out where you are going inside the virtual world and will offer you multiple world options.

, It depends on the game you’ve chosen, but some virtual worlds will allow you to change aspects of the virtual world.


You might be able to create and design your own house, pick a job, or even choose the members of a virtual family. Some sites, like Kaneva and SimCity, allow you to create your own virtual worlds and even manage your own cities, whereas other sites allow you to visit and customize preexisting virtual worlds, or both.In some virtual worlds, you get to choose a virtual pet or virtual boyfriend or girlfriend. The possibilities are endless! Some virtual worlds allow you to perform some activities for free but make you pay to do extra things, like design a private 3D home to entertain in.
The power of many virtual worlds is that they allow the user – you! – to both build and to create things. So you are able to unleash the powers of your imagination., The most common of these is the Oculus Rift DK2. Some simulation sites allow you to use hardware that creates more of an immerse experience. Other such headsets are in the works or available, such as Vive.You put the project viewer over your face like you are wearing goggles. This will allow you to feel like you are actually in the virtual world environment.Simply staring at your computer or television screen won’t fully immerse you in the virtual world. The Oculus Rift project viewer is designed to make you feel like you are actually inside the virtual world.
Not all virtual world sites allow or work with such viewers. Second Life is one that does. Viewers are being developed that will mimic your real facial expressions and place them on your avatar., There’s a lot of research into virtual worlds that shows they can have both positive and negative effects on people’s lives.Some researchers believe that spending too much time in virtual worlds can lead to isolation in real life for some people.
At the same time, some people replace their unhappy realities with a happier virtual world they are more able to control.
Some people have become addicted to virtual worlds to the degree that it has caused them to neglect their real lives. Make sure that you use virtual reality in moderation and in a way that does not cause negative effects in your actual life.

First, decide on a location for your new world.,
Now, name your world: this can be anything that you want.,
Now, you need to think of how you would enter your fantasy world.,
Now you've accessed your world: but it's blank!,
Add creatures!,
You can add bad people to make action.,
Make weapons!,
Keep it a secret!

,
Choose your side - good or bad?

,
Are there other people in your land?,
Write down everything about your world!,
Visit your world.",How to Create a Magical World," Plan out the geography and topography (the arrangement of physical and natural features), and think about the climate. You could also draw maps and pictures.;
, Don't plagiarize (taking someone else's name), though! This should express the wonder and imagination you want that world to have. For example, a world filled with demons, a bad government, antagonists (people that want to destroy the world) etc should not be called Bliss - a name more suited to a peaceful place.

, It's no use if you can't get in! Make sure that it is a secret entrance: this world isn't for just anybody. Some examples include; saying magical words before entering; crossing a bridge / rope over a river (like in the film 'Bridge to Terabithia') or a more magical transportation - you could arrange items in a particular way and use them as a teleportation board.

, Begin decorating your fresh canvas. Create of plants, weather, buildings, cliffs, etc. Make the world very detailed but only as realistic as you want.

, Use your imagination! What is their personality like? How about their appearance and origin?

, Protagonists (good people) and antagonists (the opposite) make for a great, action-filled plot line.

, You can sharpen a sturdy stick. How will you fight your enemy? Or are you the bad guy! Create an impenetrable fortress. Or, make a fortress which has only one weakness!

,,, Kings, Queens, Dwarfs?

, Create a story and a history! Make it interesting!

What is the history?,
Name it.",How to Create a Fantasy World," You must decide on a setting for your world. Is it Victorian steampunk? Futuristic? Medieval? Egyptian? Is it populated with hunter-gatherer societies? Or is it covered in gigantic, bustling mega-cities?;
, Is your world separated into different countries, or is there only one? Or, are there no countries at all?

, What are the trees like? Do the plants flower? What do they look like in different seasons? Are they green, or are they some other color?

, What kind of animals live in your world? Your imagination is the only limit. You can make up strange creatures of your own, or populate your world with dragons and phoenixes.

, What do the people look like? Are they human? What color is their skin? Do they have horns? Fur? Scales?

, Create a map of your country. It can be any shape or size. Create a key and mark forests, deserts, mountain ranges, and other biomes that appear in your world.

, If they live in cities or villages, name them and place them on the map. If they are nomads, you can mark where they've travelled.

, You can make up an alphabet, or an entirely new language. Or, they could just speak English or another language you know. What are their gods? Do they worship multiple gods, or only one? What are their festivals? What do they wear? Are they patriarchal, matriarchal, or egalitarian? What is their government like? What are some foods that they eat? Do they have pets?

, Have there been any great wars, or is your country strictly peaceful? Who have been the leaders? Have any natural disasters happened?

, Finally, think of a name for your world. Think of one that's fitting. You could use real words, like Bliss, Yellow, or Frost, or you could make one up. If you're stuck, think of the attributes of your world. If your cultures have gods, you could name the world after an aspect of the religion. For example, if your culture believes that the gods fall down on them every winter in the form of snow, and their words for 'Where the Gods Fall' are 'Anj qui omse juil', then you could call it Anjquiomsejuil, or Anj-qui-omse-juil.

, Cover all of the things you'd cover if caring for a companion animal. For example:


Where will it be kept? Can it be kept or only called?

What will it drink? Water or only certain waters from certain places? Or perhaps not water at all.
Where will it sleep? Do you need to make a bed or will it make its own nest?
What supplies will you need to take good care of this creature?
Do you need riding equipment if the creature is large enough? Or a halter, leash, etc., to restrain and lead it?
What will you do with it? Does it need training, talking to, grooming, de-fleaing, etc.? Do you want to do things with it, such as going on quests, swimming, flying, opening portals together, visiting new lands, and so forth?

Work on their breath weapon.",How to Care for a Dragon (Role Playing)," Put it in a little nest. Don't keep it under a heat lamp all the time. If this dragon were in the wild, it's mom would have gone out to get things like food for herself before the eggs hatch. So, maybe if you use a lamp often, only put the nest under the lamp when you would normally use it.;
, Keep an eye on it when it starts to move. Always be there when the dragon hatches, because, like ducks and other birds, newly hatched dragons think that the first thing it sees is it's mom. And you would be pretty embarrassed if your dragon thought that your Superman poster was it's mom, right?

, Grab a bit of meat or fish. Put the meat at the bottom of your hand. (Closest to the elbow). If the dragon is hungry, it should A)Go around your hand and get it from there. B)Get scared and won't move. Or C)climb onto your hand to get it. Do this once a day and it should trust you in about a week. Now you should have a bond.

, Once you have the bond, you can start training it. When you have its attention, flap your arms like a bird. It should do the same. While still flapping, run and jump. It should do the same. Get your hands ready to catch it if it falls. It will probably keep trying. That is how to teach it how to fly.

, When it does something good, like flying well, give it a small dog treat or little bit of meat or fish. When it does something bad, which they rarely do, firmly say no.

, Build or get a little box. Get some face cloths, then get an oven mitt. Put the face cloths in, then the oven mitt. Your dragon will sleep inside the oven mitt because it feel just like its mother's breath.

, They will love you for it. They will help for the next step too!

, They take a deep breath. If they have enough chemicals in their lungs, then it can immediately blow out the breath weapon on its victims. The toys will be great practice targets.

Have a pawn (beer) in your hand at all times.,
Retrieve a pawn from the castle.,
Play until somebody wins.,
Avoid losing along the way.,
Try reentering the game if you lose.",How to Play True American," You will need to create an area for the castle. Do this by placing a table in the middle of play area. This is where your liquor will be placed. This will be the area of main attention during the game.;
, The liquor is known as the king of the castle. This will be placed in the center of the table.

, These will be your ""pawns"" and the ""soldiers of the secret order"". These lines of pawns represent the barriers between the zones. When all the beers or pawns have been drunk or removed, the drinking from the ""king” (liquor bottle) begins.

, These spaces are where the players will stand. The center of each zone is where pawns (beers) can be taken. These are the only places where you can retrieve a pawn, so this should be the closest to the castle. Although, the center of the zones should be closest to the castle, the beginning and end of the zones are furthest away from castle. The five spaces making up the zones can be made from just about anything. Utilize pillow, blankets, furniture, chairs, or sheets of paper to create circular zones radiating from the castle. This is where the players will be standing, so make them an adequate size. The open floor is considered molten lava and should not be touched. Touching the molten lava results in losing the game.

, Depending on how many players you have you can decide how many beers you will need. Creating the perfect ratio between beers and players makes for an interesting game.

, Forming teams for the game is optional. However, it can make for a more competitive atmosphere and help get players more involved in the game.

, This can be done by having a shotgun contest or play rock paper scissors to determine who has the first turn. Whoever wins will get to go first in the game.

, The winner of the shotgun contest or rock paper scissors gets to go first and start the game. The winner does this by yelling “one, two, three, JFK”. In turn, All other players respond with yelling “FDR”, grab a pawn from the castle, and rush to any space surrounding the zones (i.e. pillow, couch, paper, blanket, etc).

, Now it is time to actually play the game. Depending on what players turn it is, they can move one space in the clockwise direction. The spaces are again made of pillows, blankets, paper, etc. However, although, the player whose turn it is gets to move the other players can win their moves as well.

, Other players can be provided with a way to move whether it is their turn or not by the following 3 ways:


The count: All players will yell “one, two, three,” and then proceed to hold up a number between one and five with their fingers on their foreheads. The player holding a number no one else has wins and moves one spot.
Complete a quote: Player whose turn it is will slowly speak a quote from history or pop culture. Any other player that is able to complete the quote before the player completes the quote wins. Winner can move two spots.
Something in common: The player will yell two people, places or things. Any other player that can name what the two have in common wins. Winner will move 3 spots.

, All players should have a beer in their hand at all times. However, they may not have more than three in any one time. Having no beers or more than three in your hand can result in loss of the game.

, Players can take a pawn or beer from the castle only when at one of the 4 center spaces. This means that the player should be standing at the center space of one of the zones to be able to grab a beer. Once you retrieve a pawn you must drink from the beer every time you move.

, After all the pawns (beers) have been removed all that is left is the king (bottle of liquor). The first player to reach a center space of each zone and drink from the king wins the game. This also signifies the end of the game.

, If you are caught without a beer in your hand or with an empty beer you lose. Also, if you are step on the molten lava you lose.

, Once you are out, there is only one way to get back in the game: open a new beer and finish that. You can drink as fast or slow as you’d like, but you cannot participate in gameplay until that beer is gone. Once you’ve finished the beer, an opponent chooses where your new starting position is, and the game is on again.

If the old one and new one seem to be okay with each other so far, take the new one out too.,
If you are experienced enough, become a breeder!",How to Adopt and Care for Invisible Pets (for Kids)," Why do you want it? Will you just end up sending it back? Do you take the concept seriously? Are you going to take care of it? Ask yourself some of these questions first.;
, It can be anything, from fish to koalas to dragons to unicorns to unisquatches to Phoenix-Kitsune hybrids (a kitsune is a mythical creature that's a fox with more than one tail). You could even have a chameleon hedgehog! It's your pet, you can choose,

, Is it a boy or a girl?

, Will it be a baby? An adult? Somewhere in between?

, The options are limitless. People have adopted invisible magenta koalas and lime-green sharks. Remember that if you believe hard enough, you will be able to see your invisible pet, while the rest of the world can't (unless they believe in it too - entirely possible situation). What's your favorite color? Maybe the pet could be that.

, There are a few ways to do so. You could find them or rescue them, but these pets are not always in the best of shape, so these invisible pets are best left to invisible pet rescues. You could also call an invisible pet shelter. One of the worldwide numbers is (123)-555-6645. Kids, this number is ""fake"". It won't work if you actually call it, but it will if you pretend call it. Another option is to go here and have them teleport one to you, or adopt one from a friend who is a breeder. You can also try making them appear in front of you. It's your choice!


Remember, you might not get the exact one you want because they might not have any open for adoption, but you bound to find something close. If you don't, maybe the pet will change over time to the pet you want.

, The name can be anything, but try not to name it mean things. Have you planned a name? You could use that. Remember, you must like the name, because you might not be able to change it.

, It will be hungry. Whatever the visible pet would eat is what it should eat, but the food must be invisible.

, Remember not to make a real call. You could also buy them at an invisible pet supply store (they don't have invisible pets though, just supplies. They're in every town; usually you can find smaller ones in all backyards or front yards.

, Don't take it out of it's carrying case quite yet.Your new invisible pet will be pretty shaken up; they've been transported to a new place. Comfort your new invisible pet. Some pets use mind communication, talking to you inside your mind. Don't block it out, let it explore your mind. You could play some music, depending on the pet.


Don't touch it yet.

, Let it out of it's carrying case, don't touch it yet, unless it's doing something bad or dangerous. Once it has explored it's new home, you can touch it, if it will let you. Let it make first contact.

, Your invisible pet eats the invisible version of whatever the visible version of your pet eats. If the real version is ""made up"", you can choose.

, Some examples are:


Chocolate (at least not a lot)
Sodas (once again, if you spill a few drops and they lick it up it's OK, and a tiny cup on occasions like it's birthday are often fine too)
Raw meat (unless that's what the visible version eats)
Poison (unless it's a Poison Eater, but those are extremely rare)
Extremely salty or extremely sugary foods
Candy

, Unless you want your pet to eat off your floor (which is not recommended, they could get an infection), find something to put the food on.

, If you are not comfortable feeding your invisible pet processed food, make your own! To most invisible pets, this is much more tasty, plus you know the ingredients.

, It will help to bathe them occasionally.

, They could also become depressed, and if it becomes severe enough, they could enter their dormant stage.

, It's nice to feed them more often though. Luckily, if they are forgotten, they won't die, no matter how sick they become, they'll only enter a dormant stage, where they won't be respondent until they are taken care of.

, If they are water dwellers, then that's covered. If not, this is the basic rate of water need for them to not go into dormancy.

, If there is no way to help the pet recover and become healthy again, the pet will most likely recover by itself.

, Even if you are the only one who can see them, they're part of the family now. Don't neglect it.

, Make sure you're ready for another one. Make sure your old pet isn't a natural predator of your new pet (or vice versa). If you get a pet that is the same species as your old one, but is the opposite gender, either spay or neuter them so they won't have babies, or be ready in case there are going to be babies.

, That will prevent fights for now.

, Put their cases so that they can see each other. Get them close enough so they can smell each other or talk via mind contact.

, If it tries to violently attack the other, put it back and repeat the acclimation process, then try again.

, if they're still ok, then you are done.

, Meet the demand for invisible pets by breeding them, you can even try to establish a hybrid as a whole species!"

",How to Play the Mummy Wrap Game," The aim of the game is to wrap up a friend like a mummy using a roll of toilet paper. You can play it with your friends or with an adult.;
, Then wrap up the mummy until he's totally covered. Start at the bottom, and work your way up. Go slowly, as toilet paper breaks easily. If your roll breaks, just tie it together again, and keep wrapping higher and higher. Make sure you leave room for his eyes, nose and mouth. When he's totally wrapped up, you can have loads of fun making him walk around and groaning like a mummy. The more the mummy moves, the more the toilet paper will fall off. When this happens, just start again with a different person being the mummy.

, One way to play which is loads of fun is to find an adult with a sense of humor, and wrap them up. It will take longer, as adults are often enormous, but keep wrapping until they totally covered. Make sure you leave room for his eyes, nose and mouth. Once your adult is completely wrapped up, dance around him to wake the mummy. Now run away or he'll catch you!

Make ""spared or scared"" cards.,
Invite your contestants.",How to Play Whodunnit (TV Show)1," You will obviously need a house to do this. It could be your house or a friends. The house doesn't have to be a mansion, but keep in mind the larger the house the better.
, The original Whodunnit has 13 contestants. However, you can play it with as few as 6 people., After you know how many people there will be, make up different murders. If you are playing with 13 people, there will be 10 murders. If you have 6 players, there will be 3 murders. There are always 3 winners, so plan the number of murders to allow for that., After you have come up with how your contestants will die, you have to write riddles to address each specific murder. The riddle will give your contestants a hint on where to look for the next clue for each murder., After the riddles, you must hide the clues, depending on what the riddle said. The riddle will lead your contestants to the second clue, and the second clue will lead them to the third clue, hidden somewhere else.

Keep in mind that the last clue is normally in a closed room. This way, once the first person finds the last clue, they are alone and can choose whether to keep the clue secret or share it with the group.

, After someone finds the second clue, the contestants will start to piece together their theory of how the murder happened. This can be in an office or a place with books. Set a video camera in the room to record what the contestants are saying., These cards inform the contestants if they live or if they have a chance to die in the next round. Make enough ""spared cards and scared"" cards.

, After you have planned everything out, it is time to have everyone over! Make one person the killer in private."

Explain what each card means.,
Cut up slips of paper.,
Write each role on the slips of paper.,
Put the slips in a bowl.,
Find a room with open space and no sharp objects.,
Turn out the lights in the room.,

Assemble all the alive players into the room where the ‘victim’ was found.,
Instruct the detective to try to figure out who is the murderer.,
Instruct the murderer to reveal themselves at the end of the game.",How to Play Murder in the Dark," Then, replace one Ace and one King in the deck. Leave the other Aces, Kings, and Jokers out., Depending on how many people are playing the game, you all may not have the same amount of cards. This is fine.

, In “Murder in the Dark”, holding a certain card means you will play a certain role in the game.


The person who is dealt the Ace is the murderer.
The person who is dealt the King is the police officer.
The person who is dealt the Jack is the detective.
If the person who has the Jack “dies”, the person who has the King becomes the detective.
If the person(s) who have the Jack or the King both “die”, the person who has the Queen becomes the detective.
However, remind everyone that they should keep whichever cards they have secret so no one knows who is the murderer, the police officer, or the detective.

, Make enough slips for each person playing. Try to make them small enough so its difficult to read what is on them from far away., You will need to write a slip for:


“Murderer”
“Detective”
On the rest of the slips of paper, write “suspect”.

, Have each player take one. Remind everyone not to reveal who they are going to play in the game.

, You don’t want to bump into anything that will injury you when you’re walking around in the dark!

, Instruct the players to walk carefully around the room and avoid sticking together or huddling in one area.

, The murderer will go around the room, find someone, and tap them on the shoulder to let them know they are now a victim.The murderer can also whisper quietly ""you're dead"" to the victim.
Alternatively, the murderer could clamp their hand over the person’s mouth to prevent the person from screaming, and then whisper ""you're dead"".
The ‘victims’ can fall down dramatically or make dramatic dying noises. Try to be as dramatic and silly as possible.

, As soon as someone says this, the player closest to the lights should turn them on.If a player sees someone standing silently alone, they can ask them, ""Are you dead?"" The player should simply indicate yes or no, but they must tell the truth so it is clear whether or not you can yell out “Murder in the Dark!”
One trick the murderer could try is hiding the person they just killed in a hiding place in the room or in another room. If the murderer successfully hides the people they “kill”, it will take longer for someone to discover the victims and allow them to “kill” people longer.
However, this tactic could allow the murderer to get caught more easily as they are distracted with dealing with the “bodies”.
Vote on whether the murderer is allowed to use this tactic as a house rule before you start the game.

, Any players who are not present should be noted as dead.


As an extra to the game, you could try to find all the dead players in their hiding places and bring them into the room.

, This step in the game could be as simple as one guess or as complicated as a question and answer session where the detective tries to solve the murder.


The role of the police officer is to enforce order while the detective tries to solve the murder.
If you decide to do a pretend Q&A, have the detective sit in a chair in front of everyone and ask questions to all the alive players, such as: Where were you when someone yelled “Murder in the Dark”? Who do you think is the murderer and why?
Once the detective has gathered enough information and decided who they suspect is the murderer, they say: “final accusation” and ask their suspect, “Are you the murderer?”
If the detective guesses who the murderer is successfully, they win the game. But if they guess incorrectly, the murderer wins the game.If the detective is killed by the murderer during the killing spree in the dark, they can be replaced by whoever had the King card.If you are not using cards for the game and the detective is killed during the murder in the dark, the game is over and can start all over again.

, They can do this by showing the Ace card."

Privately tell the person that they are going to die. Then put the other contestants in different rooms and make the crime scene., Almost every murder has a crime scene. For example, if someone got murdered by a stab to the back, then create a fake knife stuck in their back. You can use fake blood on the person and their surroundings. Makeup is also important. It doesn't have to be amazing makeup, but if their are supposed to be cuts or burns, make it look realistic., This is usually a bedroom. Maybe there is an alarm clock going off and a note saying 'meet me downstairs.', Once the contestants have seen the crime scene, move the body to the morgue., Scream or make a bang, depending on the murder. Whatever makes the contestants come to the crime scene. There they can see who is dead., They can only chose one place, either the crime scene, morgue, or victims last known whereabouts., This could also be a good time to start alliances. The contestants can share with other contestants what they found at the particular place., Encourage them to go ahead and look for the clues. You can give them an object that would help with the clue, but this is not necessary., Once someone finds the second clue, inform the others that it has been found., Allow time for the contestants to piece together what they think happened, then one by one state their case to a camera in private. Be sure to tell them to say who they think the killer is!, Explain to the contestants how the murder really happened. Then give out the ""spared or scared"" cards., Have someone who got a ""scared"" card die. Then follow steps 11-21 over and over again until you come down to the last 3 contestants., Have a mini game set up in front of them (a game that involves how they died) Put a note in their hand that describes how to solve the mini game or puzzle. For example, Don died of a mountain lion. For his game, contestants had to piece together the steps of how he died. Have the deceased give the contestant a piece of paper depending on if they were correct or incorrect. Once the contestant has gone to each dead person, tell them if they solved all of the mini games right or wrong. If wrong, have them go to the same place again until they get it right. When the first 2 contestants get it right, lead them to a separate room. The 3rd and final contestant to get it right is lead to another room where they die. The final 2 contestants say which one they think is the killer, with the killer congratulating the other for winning the game, and solving whodunnit.

For the 2 contestants to finish the mini games, one of them has to be the killer.

However, there are items that can be used in a special ritual to enable communication between you and the spirits. To summon a ghost you'll need:


Normal playing cards (1 deck)
Candles (5)
Lighter/matches
Salt (rock salt preferred)
Friends (optional);
, The spirits are sometimes hesitant to make contact with the human world in broad daylight, where their powers are weakest. You can improve your chances of contacting the spirit world by:


Waiting until after sun has set to play this game.
Drawing curtains or hanging blankets over your windows to block out the light.

, For the purposes of summoning a spirit to answer questions, you won't need a complicated magic circle to protect you. Sprinkle a fine line of salt in a broad circle around the area where you will be summoning your spirit. Salt has purifying properties, and will form an impenetrable barrier that evil spirits will not be able to pass., There are many different patterns that ghosts respond to, and you should feel free to follow your instincts while setting up your candles. However, for best results, you should place your candles:


One in each of the cardinal directions at the edge of the magic circle: north, south, east, and west. This symbolizes the ends of the earth from which you are calling the spirits.
The fifth candle should be placed in front of the person who summons the ghost, to boost his connection with the spirit world.

, If you are the summoner, you should sit as close to the center of the magic circle as possible, and you should have a clear, unblocked view of the candles surrounding you. If friends are joining you in your summoning, they should sit inside the magic circle and between the candles.


Blocking the view between the summoner and the candles can weaken his connection with the spirit world and cause the summoning to fail.
Always exercise caution when around an open flame. If you or one of your friends knocks a candle over and starts a fire, you spirit channeling game could turn into big trouble.

, If you are the summoner, you should shuffle the deck of cards regularly until you bridge the deck exactly nine times. After you have shuffled and bridged the deck nine times, cut the deck five times. While doing this, keep your mind clear, and be sure there are no interruptions.


In numerology, the number ""9"" represents patience, meditation, and the rewarding of tests.By shuffling until you bridge nine times, you invoke the nature of this number.
In numerology, the number ""5"" represents harmony, balance, and consciousness.By cutting the deck five times, you establish a harmonious union with consciousnesses outside of your magic circle.

, If you have friends taking part in your summoning, hold out the deck of cards to them face down. Have each person touch the palm of their right hand to the deck of cards, but do not let go of the deck at any point.


If the summoner loses contact with the deck, his connection with the spirit world could be weakened.
Each person touching the deck with their right hands symbolizes the right handed path of magic, sometimes called white magic., Lay out your cards in 11 at a time, arranged neatly in regular intervals. The number 11 is symbolic of revelation and insight, and by dealing your cards in sets of 11, you will improve your chances of revelation., The summoner will have the strongest connection with the spirit world due to the fact that he is at the focal point of the ritual. Now that the cards are in place, the summoner can ask:


“Are the spirits willing to speak with us tonight?”

, In this ritual, the summoner is acting as the spiritual medium, so he will have to ask all questions to the spirits and turn over cards to find their answer. To find the card the spirits have chosen as the answer to your question:


Hold your hand over the card for several seconds, with your mind clear.
Move your hand from card to card.
Flip over the card you feel giving off heat.

, Cards have long been used to predict the future through a practice of fortune telling known as cartomancy.The ritual you performed will have given the spirits the ability to answer through suits in the following way:


Hearts - Yes
Spades - No
Diamonds - Maybe
Clubs - I don’t know

, If you are the summoner, you'll have to ask questions for your friends. Ask the question out loud, in a clear voice, and then hold your hand above the cards you've laid face down to feel which is giving off the most heat. Turn over that card to receive the answer to your question.


Once you have run out of cards, you can deal another 11 card to receive more answers.
In total, you may deal 11 sets of cards three times. If you deal your answer cards a fourth time, you will be bound by the characteristics of that number.
The number ""4"" represents totality or perfection, but is also associated in many numerologies as an unlucky number., Messages that come through the veil from the spirit world are often jumbled and confused. Because of this, the more complicated the question you ask, the more likely the answer you receive might not make sense.


If you receive the answers ""I don't know"" or ""Maybe"" to many of your questions, you may have summoned a weak ghost that doesn't know much.

, Some places are full of spiritual energy, making these more ideal for the summoning of and communication with spirits. People operate on a similar principle; some people have a natural talent for connecting with the spirit world.

There are 2 teams: Slashers and Campers.,
Tell everyone that they can talk to each other (everyone can hear it) and they can text message each other.,
Have everyone go to their ""cabins"" (rooms or closets, pantries, under a desk, in a big enough cabinet, living room, etc.),
While the person giving out the pieces of papers is delivering the roles, have them have post-it notes in their pocket to give to the slashers, whether when it's the first NIGHT round or before the game even has begun.,
Each post-it note must have a round number on it written in permanent pen.,
The first round is ""night."",
The slashers stay in THEIR cabins too, but they can have other slashers meet up with them.,
Every night slashers must agree on ONE PERSON (ALL must agree) to kill.,
The next round is day, but still is Round 1.,
Who ever is killed or voted off has to draw an X on their hand and cannot interact with anyone, cannot leave hints, cannot do ANYTHING.,
Play as many rounds until the game ends, which is when either ALL the slashers are killed/voted off or all but 1 campers are killed/voted off.",How to Play Slasher on Halloween," Cut enough pieces of paper (one slip for each player) and write down the roles. There can only be 1 slasher for every 4 players. If you decide on the roles, you cannot play. It's best to have someone NOT playing (like a parent, an older sister doing homework, etc.) write down the roles. Instruct them to write down only 1 slasher for every 4 pieces of paper. If there's 5 players or an uneven number, the amount of slashers doesn't increase by 1 or whatever. Everyone MUST keep their role a secret and can only tell others they trust by text message.;
, (Private Messaging). Campers can't talk at ""night"", but they can text message. Say that everyone must meet up in the ""Voting"" room during the ""day"", but at ""night"" when they have to be ""sleeping in their cabins"", they go to their ""cabins"". (Rooms assigned to them. Closets work, too.)

, and have the person who wrote down the roles to go to each ""game"" room and give the player there their paper. Do not let anyone talk when this is happening.

, They must not let any campers or ""the three special roles"" see them or they may calculate if there were any slashers before them, and they will track them down. When they're giving the post-it note to a slasher, they must tell the slasher who are their slasher teammates.

, The first post-it note will say, ""Round 1"". The second, ""Round 2"". The third ""Round 3"", and so on. Slashers are only able to kill once per night round.

, The Campers have to stay in their ""cabins"" which is just a place away from everyone else. But they can text message each other.

, It's best if slashers have their cabins/closets next to each other or in another Slasher's room. Slashers are the only ones able to talk at ""night"" but they must do so quietly or the campers will suspect them.

, To kill this person they go to their victim's room and post one post-it on the door saying ""KILLED."" and the night round number. If the cop is protecting their victim, the cop will check when it's ""day"" to see if the person they protected was ""killed"". If the slashers DID try to kill the person the cop was protecting, then the cop rips off the note and either throws it away or puts it in their pocket or something. The cop can only do this ONCE every ""day""!

, Everyone (including Slashers to eliminate any suspicion of them) can vote for the person they suspect is a slasher. People are eliminated/voted off during the day rounds.

, This person must sit and wait in the ""KILLED"" room, which is an unused room where all the killed/voted off people go and wait for the game to end. The killed/voted off people can talk with each other, but their text messengers are confiscated until the game ends.

, Then the remaining slashers/campers/special roles reveal themselves in the ""waiting"" (aka ""KILLED"" room) room and, if desired, play another game of ""Slasher"".

Understand the origins of Bloody Mary.,
Gather your tokens.,
Spin around three times.,
Reach out to her.,
Turn on the faucet.,
Begin chanting: ""Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary...""


Continue chanting slowly, 3 to 1,000 times.,
Watch the mirror.,
Stop when you have had enough!",How to Play Bloody Mary," If you know a little historical background, you'll have a better idea what you might expect, and what first-aid supplies you should keep on hand. This game's origins are lost in the mists of time, so the stories we are left with in the twenty-first century are varied and mysterious. However, it is enlightening to understand the thoughts behind the scares, so the story's basics are outlined under ""Tips"".;
, Since you are reading this step, it is assumed that you have reached the point of no return and convinced everyone that this game is worth playing for a few scares and thrills. Begin by assembling the items that you will need: a candle, a bathroom with a mirror, some friends (preferably including at least one who screams well), and a cell phone: you never know what could happen!


You want to make sure you have at least one other person playing. Some people prefer having only one person go into the bathroom to increase tension in all the players. If you're playing the game this way, do not lock the bathroom door. That way, if someone wants to leave quickly, they do not freak out when they cannot open the door.

, It is sometimes suggested that you spin around three times if you see nothing. Feeling dizzy does wonders for seeing things. Always be confident.

, Have one person touch the mirror with one hand and the others hold hands, including the free hand of the person touching the mirror.

, Having water running may help call the spirit, because according to some legends, that was the last thing Bloody Mary heard before being brutally murdered.

, Chanting ""Bloody Mary"" thirteen times is the most popular count. The exact wording and the amount of times to speak the words can vary considerably, depending which version of the story you choose to follow. See ""Tips.""And follow.

, Believe that what you do or do not see is a personal, subjective experience—if that belief gives you comfort. Remember that you may or may not have control over your own mind. Who knows? What you see may just be your imagination—or it might be Bloody Mary herself!

, Once you are sufficiently terrified and quaking in your shoes, quickly leave the bathroom and breathe some fresh air. Laugh to release the nervous tension, and apply first aid to any wounds Bloody Mary may have given you. The game has had its impact and it's time to go and relax, be calm and forget about what has happened today.

Find some friends to play with.,
Designate the playing field.,
Choose one person to be the ghost.,
Begin the round.,
Start counting while the ghost hides.,
Leave the home base and search for the ghost in the graveyard.",How to Play Ghost in the Graveyard1," The more people you can round up, the better. Ghosts in the Graveyard is a game that works best with at least three players. 








You can add or subtract players as you continue to play as well. If someone wants to join in, just wait until the next round. Likewise, if someone wants to leave, that’s ok too.
Try to play with at least three people. More people will make the rounds last longer and can be more fun.;
, Pick a few houses, yards, or another area in the neighborhood for the boundaries. You will also need a home base at which everyone can run to when the ghost is found.









Make sure that all players understand the boundaries of the game. You can even make the rule that if a player goes outside the boundaries that player is eliminated for a round.
Your designated safe spot is where the players run to when the ghost is found. It can be a large tree, front stoop, back patio, etc. Try to designate a spot that everyone can physically touch or stand on.

, You can do this any way you like: picking a number, asking for a volunteer, or rock, paper, scissors, etc.









If you want to pick a ghost the old fashioned way, you can have everyone form a circle with both of each player’s feet. Then one person says a rhyme while tapping one foot for each word. Each time the rhyme ends that player removes a foot. The rhyme is repeated until there is one foot left. That person is the ghost.
The rhyme could be: “Bubble Gum, bubble gum in a dish. How many pieces do you wish?” Then whoever’s foot is touched says a number. The leader counts out that number and then says “…and you are out.”
After the first round, the next ghost is determined by the losing player. This is the player who was last to reach the safe zone. It can also be the first person if you wish.

, Everyone but the ghost stands at the home base while the ghost runs off to hide somewhere outside.









The ghost must hide somewhere within the designated boundaries. The ghost cannot hide inside anywhere.
The ghost should go and hide somewhere that’s not close to the base. Finding a spot that’s further away and hidden will allow the ghost to have a better chance at tagging a player.

, Chant slowly as a group, “One o’clock… two o’clock… three o’clock..."" and so on, up to twelve o'clock. Then shout, ""Midnight! I hope I don't see the ghost tonight!""









Alternatively, you can all count to 50 and then chant “Starlight, star bright, I hope to see a ghost tonight!” Depending on how large the playing area and how many places there are to hide, you want to give the ghost a good amount of time.

, The ghost's job is to jump out, surprise, and tag a player.









When anyone encounters the ghost that player should yell, “Ghost in the graveyard!"" and try to run away. When the ghost catches someone, the new person becomes the only ghost.
If the ghost doesn’t catch anyone, then the last player to reach the base is the new ghost.

Have the nominees defend themselves.,
Vote on one of the players to kill.,
Start the next night cycle.",How to Play Werewolf (Party Game)," A moderator is unnecessary since players can just follow the system guide for the day and night circles.
, At the beginning of the game, each person will be randomly assigned a role. Every player keeps a secret of his own character without letting any others know about it., The game alternates between night and day phases. The villagers win if they kill both Werewolves. The Werewolves win if they kill enough villagers so that their population size is even with each other., Nighttime means that it is time for killing, healing, and investigating. Acting tells information., Usually, they kill a Villager, but they may decide to kill a Werewolf to make the Witch use up her antidote. At night, Werewolves may also decide which of them will pretend to be the Seer and Sheriff., They don't know which people are Werewolves, but they can check one player’s identity every day. The longer the Seer lives, the more information they can glean, so Villagers want him to confirm their identity and protect them, but Werewolves also want to reveal the Seer to they can kill him off. Usually, the Seer has a high chance of becoming the Sheriff, so a skilled Seer should try his best to defeat Werewolves pretending to be Villagers during the discussion phase of the Sheriff Contest. The Seer also needs to evaluate what players are saying to identify possible targets using logic and clear-thinking.

Seers often don’t last the night so should try their hardest to identify the Werewolves quickly.

, A Witch's role is to heal a Villager with her antidote and kill a Werewolf with her poison, all while remaining hidden and surviving. She shouldn’t let the Villagers suspect her, or the Werewolves realize her identity. She cannot use her powers if she dies., A hunter is the player that Werewolves don’t dare kill. Since there aren’t many Werewolves, they can’t swap a life-for-a-life to kill the Hunter. Werewolves will do their best to convince the Hunter that an innocent Villager is lying so he will shoot them. As a Hunter, if you don’t know who is a Werewolf, it’s best not to start shooting at random players., The rest of the players are normal Villagers. Are they any use? Of course! Werewolves despise Normal Villagers the most because they can use their intelligence to confuse and trip them up. Although Werewolves know who are Villagers, they don’t know their exact identities. Sometimes a good strategy for Normal Villagers is to offer themselves up for sacrifice by pretending to be the Seer., Let the performance begin! You’ll need real acting chops, clear logic and supreme self-confidence if you want to succeed. This game is a battle of logic and eloquence. Knowing everything that’s going on is not important; what’s important is how you can make other players believe you. If you’ve gathered a lot of info, don’t start blurting it all out since you’ll just become a target for the Werewolves., There are two key ways to identify Werewolves:

Werewolves will obviously pretend to be Villagers. When pretending to be a Villager, they won’t be immediately identified, but when pretending to have a special skill (eg Seer or Witch), whoever really has that skill will know straightaway. Making the majority of people believe them is the real test of logic and eloquence for Werewolves when up against players with special skills.
Voting: The Werewolves’ objective is to eliminate all the Villagers. So, in order to survive they’re obviously not going to give up the chance to vote. Sometimes when a Werewolf frames a Villager, the other Werewolf will also vote for that Villager so that he’s voted out of the game. Werewolves may also try to frame different Villagers during one day but then vote for the same player. When Werewolves say one thing but vote another way it’s easy for them to reveal their identity because they know who’s on their team and the Villagers don’t.

, Each round, at least two players should be nominated to be killed. Anyone can nominate another player, and the nominations should go to players that somebody thinks is a werewolf., Once the nominations have been made, each player gets 30 seconds to convince the rest of the room that they're not a Werewolf. The nominees should get to speak uninterrupted, since it may well be the last chance they have to save themselves!, Once the nominees have defended themselves to the other players, vote on which of the players to kill. Each player can vote only once. The nominee that receives the most votes gets killed. This person should not reveal what their role was., The game proceeds with another round of night and day cycles until all Werewolves are dead, or until Villagers are outnumbered."

Collect your supplies for communicating with the spirits.,

Determine if your summoning worked.,
Touch the coin to provide it with energy and get your answer.Have each person involved in the summoning place a single finger on the coin lightly.,
Interpret the meaning of the message.","How to Play the Spirit Channeling Game ""Ghost""2"," You'll need to make a spirit board to channel the energies flowing from the spirit world into answers to your question. This method is less dependent on the skills of the medium, so it's a good option for beginners. To make your spirit board and communicate with a ghost, you'll need:


Paper
Pencil
Candles (5)
Lighter/matches
Salt (rock salt preferred)
Friends (optional)

, Bright light and loud noise can interrupt the flow of spirit energy from the spirit world into your spirit board, making it difficult to get the answers you seek. You might consider:


Waiting until late at night.
Finding a remote location.

, Take your blank sheet of paper and write every letter of the alphabet on it along with the numbers zero through nine.You should use large handwriting and leave some space between the letters and numbers to make interpreting the message from the spirits easier.


You may also want to include the words initium and terminus on your spirit board. These terms mean ""start"" and ""end"" in Latin, respectively.

, Lay your spirit board so that it is flat on the floor or table where you intend to summon your ghost. Around your spirit board, sprinkle a fine line of salt to create a circle of protection.Then:


Place a candle at each of the four points of the compass around the outside of the circle of protection and light each.
Place your fifth candle above the topmost edge of the middle of your board and light it as well.

, Do not place your coin on any letters or numbers, instead place it on a blank space on your spirit board. Then, join hands with any friends that are with you around the spirit board, and say:


""Spirit, we call to you from beyond the veil. Answer our call.""

, Sometimes, the alignment of the stars or other factors in nature can close the doors of the spiritual world, making communication with spirits all but impossible. To make sure you have a good connection with the spirit world through your spirit board, you should first ask:


""Spirit, are you willing to speak with us tonight?""

, You do not want to exert pressure on the coin, you only want to provide it with enough of your energy to reveal the answer of the spirit.


After waiting a period of time, the coin should begin to move, pausing for moments on letters and numbers.
Record all places the coin pauses until it either stops moving or comes to a rest on the word terminus, or ""end"" in Latin.

, Messages from the spirit world are often unclear, out of context. You may not be able to decipher a message right away. If you are talking to a particularly lively spirit, you may want to have a member write down each of the letters or numbers indicated by the pausing of the coin."

Use relaxation techniques.,
Cope with nightmares.",How to Avoid Getting Too Scared when Playing a Scary Computer Game," One simple way to reduce fear is to play the game with the lights on. Shutting the lights off and then playing a game that frightens you is a recipe for disaster. Keep the lights on if you tend to get scared.Play the game in a brightly lit area of your home. Switch on any lights nearby.
If possible, play the game during the day. In addition to helping you avoid darkness, playing during the daytime can help. You'll have more time to do something afterwards, like go for a walk or talk to a friend.;
, Music and sound effects can greatly enhance the scary aspects of a computer game. Hearing eerie music and disturbing noises is unlikely to help you remain calm while playing a video game. Switch the sound off for a calmer experience.You can also play calming music while playing the game on silent. Replacing a disturbing soundtrack with a more lighthearted one may make for a better gaming experience.

, If you start to get scared during gameplay, see if you can find a way to incorporate humor. Make your character move in a manner that looks like they are dancing. If you are able to name characters, try giving characters funny names. A villain with a silly name is less likely to scare you than a villain with an intimidating name., In many computer games, easy mode can feel less scary. You'll be able to more easily defeat any villains in the game. This will make the gaming experience less intimidating. If the game offers different levels of difficulty, select the easiest level., Playing a game alone can contribute to you getting scared. If you play the game with a group of friends, you may feel more relaxed. Try to get a group of people together to play the game. This will calm your nerves.If you're embarrassed about being scared, you don't have to tell people that's why you want to play in a group. You can simply say you want to play the game together.
Choose people who have a higher tolerance for frightening media than you. Their laid back nature will rub off on you.

, It can help to know why you're afraid of the game. This can help you see where your fears are irrational. Ask yourself, ""What am I really afraid of? Why is this game bothering me?""Think about why a game may trigger fear. If you're superstitious by nature, for example, a game about ghosts may remind you of a longstanding fear of the paranormal.
Once you've identified your fear, you'll be able to separate that fear from the game. You can think to yourself, ""I'm afraid of something else and not this game. This game is not related to what's really bothering me.""

, Visualization can help lessen your fear of frightening media. Before playing the game, try to picture yourself playing the game and enjoying it without getting nervous. This will help prime your mind and body to relax during game play.Picture yourself sitting calmly and playing the game. Imagine yourself laughing and enjoying yourself. Use all your senses. Think about the sounds, smells, and physical sensation that go along with the game.
If you spend a minute visualizing yourself enjoying the game, you won't go into the game with nerves.

, You may unknowingly exaggerate the consequences of your fear. For example, ""I won't sleep all night if I play this game."" This is probably not true. While you may have trouble sleeping, you will probably not be up all night simply because of a disturbing video game.Be honest about the consequences of playing the game. Will it really affect you that much to get a little scared? What's the worst that can happen if you play the game?
Chances are, the fear will be difficult to deal with. However, it will not be insurmountable. If you truly enjoy this game, it's probably worth scaring yourself a little.

, Be aware of what you're feeling when you play the game. When you find yourself having a fearful though, counter it with positive self-talk. This will help you keep your emotions in check as you play the game.Check for when you're having a fearful thought. For example, you may think something like, ""I wonder what I would do if I really saw a ghost. I would be so scared.""
Counter this with some positive and rational self-talk. For example, ""It's very unlikely I will ever see a ghost and, if I do, I trust myself to keep my cool.""

, After you finish up with the game, don't dwell on it. This will only make your fear worse. Instead, find something relaxing to focus on to help you calm down.Try to concentrate on your immediate surroundings. This can really help you remove yourself from fearful thoughts. Think about how your body feels, how you're sitting or standing, or any sounds nearby.
You can also focus on your breathing. Take a very deep breath, making sure to inhale through your nose. Place your hand on your belly before breathing, and try to breathe in a way that makes this hand rise. Hold the breath for a second or two and then slowly exhale through your mouth., Stress and fear can easily be combated with physical exercise. Try doing something like going for a walk, a run, or a bike ride after the game. You can also do something like jumping jacks or pushups in your living room. A light workout can help reduce stress and anxiety over the game.For added relaxation, try listening to calming songs while you exercise. You can make a playlist of your go-to relaxation songs to play during a workout.

, Keeping your feelings bottled up can make stress and fear worse. To calm your nerves after playing a game, call or text a friend. You don't have to explain the situation if you're embarrassed. You can simply chat about other things until you start to calm down., Relaxation techniques are practices you can use to calm down. If your mind is reeling from an unpleasant experience with a video game, a few good relaxation techniques can help alleviate the problem.Try imaging something relaxing. You can, for example, picture yourself floating on a cloud.
Listen to relaxing music. A soothing playlist can help take your mind off of a scary computer game.
Simply taking slow, deep breaths can help ground you after playing a scary game.

, You may have a nightmare after playing a scary video game. If this occurs, there are many ways you can cope. Try to stay calm after a nightmare and get yourself back to bed.If someone else in your house is awake, talk through your nightmare with them. You may also find one of your friends is online or awake to text.
Envision something relaxing after a nightmare. Picture yourself sitting on a beach, for example.
If you have a nightlight, turning that on after a nightmare may help.

Get to home base safely.",How to Play Ghost in the Graveyard2," The more people you can round up, the better. Ghosts in the Graveyard is a game that works best with at least three players. 








You can add or subtract players as you continue to play as well. If someone wants to join in, just wait until the next round. Likewise, if someone wants to leave, that’s ok too.
Try to play with at least three people. More people will make the rounds last longer and can be more fun.

, Pick a few houses, yards, or another area in the neighborhood for the boundaries. You will also need a home base at which everyone can run to when the ghost is found.









Make sure that all players understand the boundaries of the game. You can even make the rule that if a player goes outside the boundaries that player is eliminated for a round.
Your designated safe spot is where the players run to when the ghost is found. It can be a large tree, front stoop, back patio, etc. Try to designate a spot that everyone can physically touch or stand on.

, You can do this any way you like: picking a number, asking for a volunteer, or rock, paper, scissors, etc.









If you want to pick a ghost the old fashioned way, you can have everyone form a circle with both of each player’s feet. Then one person says a rhyme while tapping one foot for each word. Each time the rhyme ends that player removes a foot. The rhyme is repeated until there is one foot left. That person is the ghost.
The rhyme could be: “Bubble Gum, bubble gum in a dish. How many pieces do you wish?” Then whoever’s foot is touched says a number. The leader counts out that number and then says “…and you are out.”

, All the players who are seeking are at home base while the ghost goes off to hide somewhere.









The players should not be looking where the ghost is going to hide. Everyone's eyes should be closed.

, Chant slowly as a group, “One o’clock… two o’clock… three o’clock..."" and so on, up to twelve o'clock. Then shout, ""Midnight! I hope I don't see the ghost tonight!""









Alternatively, you can all count to 50 and then chant “Starlight, star bright, I hope to see a ghost tonight!” Depending on how the large the playing area and how many places there are to hide, you want to give the ghost a good amount of time.
The ghost must hide somewhere within the designated boundaries. The ghost cannot hide inside anywhere. The ghost does not have a flashlight.
The ghost should go and hide somewhere that’s not close to the base. Finding a spot that’s further away and hidden will allow the ghost to have a better chance at tagging a player.

, With your flashlight, head out and start looking for the ghost. If the ghost finds you and tags you, you turn off your flashlight and become a ghost as well.









When the ghost finds a seeking player, that player then turns off the flashlight and takes the ghost's hiding spot. The original ghost is then free to move around the playing field and hide somewhere else.
The ghost will then wait in a new spot to tag another player. That player then turns off the flashlight and hides.

, If the sneaking ghost is seen by a seeking player going to a new hiding spot that player yells ""Ghost in the graveyard!""









Once the ghost has been spotted by a player with a flashlight, all the players who are still seeking turn off the flashlight and get some time to hide.
The players who are already hiding and are also ghosts will come out. The ghosts will all meet at the home base.

, The alive players now go and hide. Then the others who are now ghosts will come out from home base and search the area.









Once the original ghost has been spotted the roles of each type of player switch. If you were tagged by the ghost and hiding, you are now a ghost who is looking for the alive players.
If you were still an alive player when the ghost was spotted, you now go hide.
The ghosts will all go to the home base and count while the alive players hide.

, The ghosts will begin searching for the other players. When the alive players think that it is safe to go to base, the players try to get to the base without getting tagged.









As long as it's not too dark and everyone can easily move safely, no one should have flashlights at this stage.
If you are running toward the base and get tagged you immediately become a ghost and join the hunt.
The first player who gets to home base safely without getting tagged yells out. That player is the winner and gets to start as the ghost the next round.
If no one gets to the base safely, then the players pick a new ghost in a way that everyone agrees upon.

, Pick a few houses, yards, or another area in the neighborhood for the boundaries. You will also need a home base at which everyone can run to when the ghost is found.









Make sure that all players understand the boundaries of the game. You can even make the rule that if a player goes outside the boundaries that player is eliminated for a round.
Your designated safe spot, or, home base is where players run to when the ghost is found. It can be a large tree, front stoop, back patio, etc. Try to designate a spot that everyone can physically touch or stand on.

The rhyme could be: “Bubble Gum, bubble gum in a dish. How many pieces do you wish?” Then whoever’s foot is touched says a number. The leader counts out that number and then says “…and you are out.”

, This version of the game involves one player being the storyteller and guiding the group through the graveyard.









The storyteller is in charge of making up a spooky story. The story usually involves a group of people wandering through a graveyard at night.
You can pick the storyteller the same way you pick the ghost, or however you think is fair. If someone volunteers to be the storyteller that works too.

, The ghost and storyteller find a place for the ghost to hide.









All of the other players stand at the home base with eyes closed while the ghost and storyteller go choose a hiding place for the ghost. The storyteller needs to know where the ghost is hiding so that this player can lead the others to the ghost.
Although everyone's eyes should be closed, it's more fun if the storyteller takes a roundabout route back to home base after leaving the ghost's hiding spot. Not taking a direct path back to base will make it harder for the players to know where the ghost is.

, Once the ghost has hidden, the storyteller walks back to everyone else and starts the story. Everyone follows the storyteller.









The job of the storyteller is to lead the group through the playing area. The storyteller should not go right to the ghost.

, The storyteller tells a scary story, walking around the play area.









The storyteller can choose to tell a story without any help, slowly leading the other players to the ghost. But it can be more fun and interactive for everyone if the storyteller asks the players where to go. And then forms a story around the players' decisions.
The storyteller may start the story saying something like ""A group of brave adventurers set out to search the graveyard for a ghost who was guarding a great treasure. Which way did the adventurers head first?""
Then the other players can decide together where to go and look. Once everyone agrees, the storyteller will lead the players to that area. If the ghost is not there, the storyteller can add to the story with something like ""The adventurers came upon an old tombstone. The wind began to howl but upon searching it, they found nothing."" This will add suspense. The storyteller can even add a clue that will help the players get closer to the ghost.

, The storyteller will eventually lead the players to the ghost. The ghost then jumps out and tries to tag two players before anyone reaches home base.









The two people who are tagged will be ""it"" the next round. Both players will agree who will be ghost and storyteller, respectively.
Alternatively, players can decide that the first two players who reach the home base get to be the ghost and storyteller.
If no one is tagged, then everyone will agree on a way to choose the next ghost and storyteller.

On starting the game you will see a cutscene.,
As you get further down the path it will get darker, and you will see a radio tower, a staple place in the story.,
Now go into the house garden, and you will notice two playsets.,
Now you have two things in your scrapbook- a missing poster and a note.,
Now go inside.,
After finding the torch, there are 5 scrapbook pieces downstairs to find.,

Instead of trying to walk behind the car, continue walking down the path. At this point Slender won't even try to catch you, so be happy to just take in the sights.;
, If you want to get to the house you are going to faster, though, you can take an early shortcut down a steep path. Please note that this will make it get darker quicker. Once you reach the house, turn right and look for the tree with a missing sign. Once you find it pick the sign up.

, The first is a swingset that if you touch you will get a message. The second is a slide. Climb to the top of the slide and you will find a note marked as (3). Pick it up. You do not need to pick it up at this point, though it is probably the best time as Slenderman is less likely to catch you.

, Before we go any further please note that scrapbook parts are not required and only there to enhance your gaming experience. Do not worry if you do not collect them all.

, There are two possible entrances; the front door and the garage door. It doesn't matter which door you go in, as they both lead you inside! Now that you are inside there are multiple things to do, but the first and most important thing is locating the torch!

, To give exact locations would take too long, so I will just give a basic idea. There is a funeral note in the kitchen, alongside a marker board on the fridge. There are also two notes and a thank you card. Next head upstairs and look for a key in one of the rooms.

, After picking up a note that is inside, you will hear a girl screaming and your mission will change. Head outside and run outside the now unlocked back gate.

, There are two. There are also generators that will turn on some lights that will lighten the way. Turn them on if you wish, though they are not essential.Slender will appear on the hills every once in a while though will not chase you aggressively.

, Inside is a weeping boy, later found out to be Charlie. If you get too close he will jump out on you, so be careful.You do not need to go inside, though there is a scrapbook piece.

, After heading inside and picking up the book, you have completed the level.

, Continue folding in the same direction. You should end up with a long strip of folded paper. Place the first sheet down so the long side of the paper is facing you and retrieve the other sheet of paper.

, Make the same folds in the previous steps so that you end up with two long folded paper strips. One of the strips will be used to form the barrel and the other piece will create the handle.

, Go from left to right. This will make the longer side of your paper half the length that it was.

, Fold both ends of the strip down at slightly less than a 90 degree angle.When you're done, the paper should somewhat resemble the number seven.

, Undo the last two folds so you have a long strip again. You should be able to see the crease marks from your previous folds. There will be one in the center, and another on each side, halfway to the edge of the paper.

, Fold the ends of the strip along the previous fold lines. You will end up with a crease in the center and a strip at each end that is folded downward. It should almost look like a shirt collar at this point.

, Take the left side and fold it along the center crease so that it is aligned with the right side. You should once again have a piece that resembles a 7 shape. You should now see a loop-like opening where you will be able to slide the other piece of paper. This will form the handle of your paper gun.

, Go from left to right. This will make this piece half as long. This piece will form the barrel of your paper gun once you insert it through the opening of the handle.

, Hold the handle piece by the open end at the base with the loops facing away from you. Take one folded side of the barrel piece and slide it over the bottom segment of the handle and under the top segment. Take the other folded side of the barrel and slide it over the bottom of the handle and under the top segment as well.

, This will help adjust the gun to the proper shape. Don’t make it too tight or the slide won’t function. You don’t want your gun to jam.

Repeat for each fish.

,

Tie a length of string to one end of the rod or stick and wind around it a little onto the stick for strength. The length of the string should be around 60cm (24"") but test to adjust length as you see fit.






Tie another knot after winding, then either tape around this or glue to ensure it stays in place.






Tie the magnet onto the other end of the string.







, This step isn't essential but looks nice. If you don't want to make a pond, the fish can simply be scattered across the floor. To make a pond, cut out a pond shape from paper and paint it blue (or use blue paper). Alternatively, recycle the lid off a cardboard box and turn it into a fish pond, painting it blue.


Unwanted large bowls or containers can also serve as ""ponds"".

, The object of the game can be to get as many fish as possible in a set time or to simply have fun. The competitiveness of it depends on the children's ages. Toss the fish onto or into the pond area and have each child take turns to catch the fish. You can make up your own rules as to how much time each player has and what constitutes winning, if at all.


For older children, different colors or adding numbers to the fish during the design process can make the game more challenging. For example, children could try to catch fish with the highest numbers or the first person to get all the blue fish, etc.

Aim and release.",How to Make a Paper Hornet," Grab the first piece of paper you can find. Hornets are made from a standard sheet of notebook paper in most cases, but you could also use a Post-It note, index card, candy wrapper, magazine page, etc. Whatever you have on hand that can be folded up will do the trick.Hornets can be improvised out of almost any foldable material you find lying around, including cardstock, foil and newspaper. Get creative if you don’t have any normal paper.
Heavy and glossy types of paper will add weight, increasing the distance and impact you can achieve.;
, Begin by cutting or tearing your paper source into a thin strip. Use scissors for more precise edges, or just tear with your hands if you’re in a hurry. Go straight across the sheet of paper so that the strip is roughly 8 inches (20cm) long and 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5—4cm) wide .Creasing the paper with your fingernail before tearing it will result in cleaner edges.
By tearing the paper into 4 or 5 individual strips, you can fashion several hornets at a time.

, Take the strip of paper you just cut and make a couple of even folds along its length. For this step you can either fold the strip into thirds or double it over in half twice so that it becomes nice and compact. The more times you fold, the farther it will go and the harder it will hit.The idea is to keep the hornet to a predetermined width (that of the original strip of paper) while folding it down to decrease its surface area.

, As an alternative, you can roll the strip of paper into a narrow tube rather than folding it. Some people prefer to roll hornets for the sake of saving time, or to keep them from having to make multiple careful folds. Rolling the paper before folding it into its final shape also makes the hornet more dense, allowing it to shoot better.Rolling your hornets as opposed to folding them can save you time if you’re stockpiling ammunition for friendly warfare.
Watch out: hornets made using this method hurt a lot more!

, Now that the paper has been folded or rolled, turn it and fold it in half lengthwise. Make sure both ends of the paper line up evenly. Then, fold it in half again. The number of times you’re able to fold the hornet will depend on the size of the original paper, as well as your strength and patience. Keep folding until you have a V-shaped projectile that’s roughly an inch (2.5cm) long and tightly packed.


After you’re finished, you can reinforce the hornet by wrapping it in duct or electrical tape. The tape will keep it from losing its shape and also give it more heft. This is about as heavy-duty as hornets get.
Each time you fold the paper, the hornet will become denser and more difficult to fold. The upside of this is that the reduced size and added density will cause it to sail like a dream.

, Dig up a rubber band you can use to fire the hornet. Any type of rubber band will work, as long as it’s not too small, or brittle with age. Test the rubber band by seeing how far you can stretch it. More stretch equals a faster, longer shot.


For best results, see if you can obtain one of the thick, colorful bands used to secure the stalks of produce at grocery stores.
Rubber bands that are old, dry or show signs of wear and tear are prone to snapping unexpectedly. This could be bad news if it were to hit you in the face or eyes.

, Place one end of the rubber band over your pointer finger and the other end over your thumb. To launch the hornet, you’ll be using your hand like a makeshift slingshot.Position the rubber band so that it wraps flat around your hand without any twists.
Keep your fingers braced firmly when you pull back the hornet to generate more elastic energy.

, Grab the hornet with your free hand. Align the center crease of the hornet horizontally with the rubber band so that the ends are pointing straight up and down. Make sure the paper stays neatly folded before you attempt to shoot it.If the last fold you made in the hornet isn’t perfectly even, it may not shoot straight.

, Take hold of the ends of the hornet on either side of the rubber band and pinch them together. The hornet should now be enclosing the rubber band, with the crease grabbing both strands for maximum power. Draw back the hornet until the rubber band is at full tension.


Don’t pull the rubber band back too far or it could snap.

, Sight between your thumb and forefinger to pick out where you want to place your shot. Be careful to keep your palm facing upwards so that the hornet doesn’t strike the webbing of your hand when you let go. When you’ve zeroed in on your target, let it fly! Try getting in a little target practice with stationary objects before putting your hornets into action for real.Release the hornet in one quick motion to keep from dulling your shot.
When launched at high speeds, hornets can really pack a wallop. There is a real risk of injury if a hornet were to hit someone in any of the sensitive areas of the face.

First, get a A3 size paper to use.,
Draw a battle arena, and your character in it.

,
Give him/her a Rusty Sword and Wooden Shield to start off.

,
Draw an enemy.,
Make him fight: Let's say the Rusty Sword does 3-7 Dmg and your enemy does about 2-4 Dmg.,
When you win, you raise your EXP bar, and when it gets full, you level up.

,
When you level up, you unlock a MP bar and a spell (E.G Fireball).

Draw the board.,
Have the first player go first.,
Have the second player go second.,
Keep alternating moves until one of the players has drawn a row of three symbols or until no one can win.,
Keep practicing.,
Make the best first move.,
React appropriately if the other player goes first.,
Follow the ""right, left, above, and below"" strategy.,
Use the three-corner strategy.,
Play against a machine.,
Take it to the next level.",How to Play Tic Tac Toe," First, you have to draw the board, which is made up of a 3 x 3 grid of squares. This means it has three rows of three squares. Some people play with a 4 x 4 grid, but that is for more advanced players, and we will focus on the 3 x 3 grid here.;
, Though traditionally, the first player goes with ""X"", you can allow the first player to decide whether he wants to go with ""X""s or ""O""s. These symbols will be placed on the table, in the attempt to have three of them in a row. If you're going first, then the best move you can make is to move into the center. This will maximize your chances of winning, since you'll be able to create a row of three ""X""s or ""O""s in more combinations (4) this way than if you chose a different square.

, After the first player goes, then the second player should put down his symbol, which will be different from the symbol of the first player. The second player can either try to block the first player from creating a row of three, or focus on creating his or her own row of three. Ideally, the player can do both.

, The first player to draw three of his or her symbols in a row, whether it is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, has won tic-tac-toe. However, if both players are playing with optimal strategy, then there's a good chance that no one will win because you will have blocked all of each other's opportunities to create a row of three.

, Contrary to popular belief, tic-tac-toe isn't purely a game of chance. There are some strategies that can help you optimize your skills and to become an expert tic-tac-toe player. If you keep playing, you'll soon learn all of the tricks to making sure you win every time -- or, at least, you'll learn the tricks to make sure you never lose. Its like 0's and x's.

, The best move, if you go first, is to go in the center. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. If you go in the middle, you will have the highest chance of winning the game. And if you let your opponent go there, you will have the highest chance of losing. And you don't want that, do you?


If you don't go in the center, your next best move is to go in one of the four corners. That way, if your opponent does not choose the center (and a novice player may not), then you have a high chance of winning.
Avoid the edges as a first move. The edges are the four boxes that are neither the center or the corner. If you go here first, you will have the smallest chance of winning.

, If the other player goes first and does not go in the center, then you should go in the center. But if the other player does go in the center, then your best bet is to place your symbol on one of the corner squares.

, This is another sure-fire strategy that will help you win the game. When your opponent makes a mark, see if you can place your symbol to the right of his symbol. If you can't, then see if you can place it to the left. If you can't, then move it above your opponent's symbol. And finally, if that doesn't work, see if you can move your mark below your opponent's. This strategy ensures that you'll be most successful at optimizing your position and blocking your opponent from scoring.

, Another strategy for winning the game of tic-tac-toe is to place your symbols in three of the four corners of the board. This can optimize your chances of getting three in a row because you'll be able to create a diagonal row or rows along the sides of the grid. This will work if your opponent does not completely thwart you, of course.

, If you really want to up your strategy and make sure that you never lose, then it's best to play as much as you can instead of memorizing a list of strategies. You can find computers online that can play against you and will quickly be able to play a game where you never lose (even if you can't win)., If you feel stifled by the 3 x 3 board, then it may be time for you to play on a board that is 4 x 4 or even 5 x 5 squares large. The bigger the board, the bigger the row you'll have to create; for the 4 x 4 board, you'll need to create 4 symbols in a row and for the 5 x 5 board, you'll need to create a row of 5 symbols, and so on.

Choose your categories.,
Choose your number.,
Start going around your paper.,
Cross off the item you land on.,
Keep going around the paper and skip over crossed off slots.,
Circle your final choices in each category.,
Finish off the game!",How to Play M.A.S.H1," Basic M.A.S.H. consists of only four categories:

People you're going to marry: choose two people you love, one person who you think is okay, and another person you would NEVER want to marry.










 


Number of kids you're going to have: This goes on the bottom of your paper, you'll want to put down the numbers ""1, 2, 3, 4"".













The car you'll have: This will go on the left side of your paper. Choose 4 cars you want or choose 4 cars for the other person.
M.A.S.H. Write M.A.S.H. at the very top of your sheet. M.A.S.H. represents your home: 'M' meaning you will live in a mansion, 'A' meaning you'll live in an apartment, 'S' meaning you'll live in a shack, and 'H' meaning you'll live in a house.;
, You'll need to choose a number so you can go around the paper and cross off different options (this will be explained in the next step).









There are many ways to choose your number -- you can close your eyes and dot the paper until someone tells you to stop and then count how many dots you have, or you can close your eyes while making a spiral and count how many times you went around. In the example shown, there are eight dots on the paper, so eight will be the number used for this game.

, Starting from the 'M' in ""M.A.S.H.,"" start going around your paper. In the example shown, the number chosen was eight so you will want to move eight steps to the right. Starting from 'M' it will go:









M - Step 1
A - Step 2
S - Step 3
H - Step 4
Harry - Step 5
Niall - Step 6
Zayn - Step 7
Liam - Step 8

, Since eight was the number chosen for the number of steps in the example, ""Liam"" will be crossed off since it was on the eighth step. Depending on your chosen number, something else might be crossed off.









For example if your number was 3, the 'S' in ""M.A.S.H."" would be crossed off. If your chosen number was 11, the number 2 at the bottom would be crossed off. If your chosen number was 6, whose ever name you put in the ""Niall"" slot would be crossed off.

, Now that ""Liam"" is crossed off in the example, you'll want to keep going around the paper using the same chosen number. After ""Liam"" comes the number 4 at the bottom:









4 - Step 1
3 - Step 2
2 - Step 3
1 - Step 4
Garbage Truck - Step 5
Jeep Wrangler - Step 6
Honda Civic - Step 7
Mercedes Benz - Step 8. So now that the second eighth step has been reached in the example, it will be crossed off.
Keep going around the paper as explained, but in this example the next eighth step is ""Liam"" and that's already been crossed out! What you do is skip over ""Liam"" since it's already been crossed out and cross out the next item, which in this case is the number ""4.""

, As you keep going around the paper crossing things off, your list in each category will get smaller and smaller. If you follow the example, you'll notice that the car category is the first to be left with only one choice! The remaining car is circled (to denote that this is the car that you will drive in the future). Then keep counting around the paper, skipping over the cars section.








, Keep going around and round until you completely finish the game. Once you finish, you can interpret the results! In the example, 'M', 'Harry', '5', and 'Garbage Truck' ended up being circled. If you were using the example that would mean that you would be living in a mansion, married to Harry, with 5 kids and your car would be a Garbage Truck.









Have a friend do it for you and you do it for a friend. Then present them with their future once you're done!

Draw a major landmass (E.g.,
If you drew an asteroid, read Section A.,

Don't forget to read this once you've drawn most of your city!",How to Draw Stickmen Cities," A small planet or asteroid, a mountain, flat plains, etc.). Also, it is recommended to draw a lake or ocean. Remember to draw in 2D, and remember that these ""cities"" are always cut in half, so if you draw a sky-rise, draw the inside of it.
, If you drew a mountain or flat plains, read Section B. If you drew something random, like an island, read Section C.







Section A: For an asteroid, you should draw craters on the surface. Decide what kind of asteroid it should be (should it be a city? Maybe an alien-stickfigure base? Or maybe an unexplored planet?). If it's a city, decide whether you will draw the city on the surface, or make it a ""hollowed out asteroid"" by erasing a small section of the surface, and draw 2 walls on each side. Make it open into a large room, make more tunnels leading out of that room. Let them lead to other rooms, like the research center, McDonalds, the asteroid core, or other things! Let your imagination go wild!






Section B: For mountains, draw a gigantic jagged triangle-like shape in the middle of flat plains. It is recommended to make valleys with towns or cities in them, caves with secret passageways or ferocious animals, maybe even a mountain lake! For the flat plains, try making cities, oceans, and tunnels leading into the ground. For the cities, you need large buildings, so draw a gigantic rectangle sticking into clouds, and then draw the inside of them. You could have stickmen working at computers, a business meeting, or anything else! For the lakes, try to draw boats (don't forget the insides) and fish. You could make a comical scene with a fish, eating a smaller fish, which is eating a smaller fish, etc. For the tunnels, make them lead deep underground, with miners, beds, and other things. You could even draw a waterfall flowing underground coming from nowhere! Be creative, let your imagination go wild!






Section C: If you drew something random, like an island, a train, or something else, don't forget the major details. For something like an island, try to draw palm trees, exotic fruits and animals, maybe a shipwreck here and there, and don't forget the ocean on either side! For something like a moving vehicle, like a train, you could draw some people who ""hitched"" a ride in one of the cars, an extravagant dining car, or, if those things don't suit you, you could make your city ride the rails, drawing banks, homes, places to work, a movie theater, and more! Let your imagination go wild!

, Don't forget to add the stickmen to your city, and make sure they're doing something! They can be walking, or on the computer at work, or sleeping, or anything! Have fun!"

",How to Create a 4Th Edition Dungeons and Dragons Character,"

The Player's Handbook (PHB) is probably the most important one here. The Player's Handbook 2 and 3 (PHB2 and PHB3) extend it and might also be useful.


A single set of D&D dice, usually priced at $6-$10 USD.
Regular line paper can be used,
A writing utensil. Pencils are preferred due to the massive amount writing and erasing

,


The following races are available to play in 4th edition: Deva, Dragonborn, Drow, Dwarf, Eladrin, Elf, Genasi, Githzerai, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Goliath, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Halfling, Hamadryad, Human, Kalashtar, Shifter, Minotaur, Mul, Pixie, Revenant, Satyr, Shadar-Kai, Shade, Shardmind, Thri-Kreen, Tiefling, Vryloka, Warforged, and Wilden.

The races of Dragonborn, Dwarf, Eladrin, Elf, Half-Elf, Halfling and Human can be found in the PHB.
The races of Deva, Gnome, Goliath, Half-Orc, and Shifter can be found in the PHB2.
The races of Githzerai, Minotaur, Shardmind, and Wilden can be found in the PHB3.
The races of Drow and Genasi can be found in the Forgotten Realms Player's Guide.
The races of Warforged, Changeling and Kalashtar can be found in the Eberron Player's Guide.
The races of Mul and Thri-Kreen can be found in the Dark Sun Campaign Setting.

The races of Shade and Vryloka can be found in the Heroes of Shadow.
The races of Satyr, Pixie and Hamadryad can be found in Heroes of The Feywild.

;
, The four roles are Controller, Defender, Leader, and Striker.


Controllers deal damage to multiple enemies and prefer offense over defense. Controller classes include Druids, Invokers, and Wizards.
Defenders are front-line combatants and have high defense. Defender classes include Fighters, Paladins, and Wardens.
Leaders have healing and aiding abilities to protect the rest of the party as their roll, and also boast high defense. Leader classes include Bards, Clerics, Shamans, and Warlords.
Strikers deal massive damage to single enemies at a time and have the highest attack and mobility of the party. Striker classes include Avengers, Barbarians, Rangers, Rogues, Sorcerers, and Warlocks.

, You should consult their descriptions in the source books in making this decision.


The PHB contains information on the classes Cleric, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warlock, Warlord, and Wizard.
The PHB2 contains information on the classes Avenger, Barbarian, Bard, Druid, Invoker, Shaman, Sorcerer, and Warden.
The PHB3 contains information on the classes Ardent, Battlemind, Monk, Psion, Runepriest, and Seeker.

, Also create a vertical column with six lines title stats. At the beginning of each line, write down the following: Strength (Str), Constitution (Con), Dexterity (Dex), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). These make up the six ability scores of your character. ]]


Strength represents physical power.
Constitution represents health and stamina.
Dexterity represents agility and reflexes.
Intelligence represents reasoning.
Wisdom represents common sense.
Charisma represents personality.

, Ability scores are the base statistics for your character and can be determined with one of three methods. Note that each class depends on certain ability scores, which typically means that you should assign higher scores to these abilities.


The first method uses a standard array of scores. Assign the following numbers to each ability score any way you like: 16, 14, 13, 12, 11, and 10.
The second method is a little more complicated. Start with the following scores: 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, and 10. You have 22 ""points"" to spend in order to increase the ability scores. Use the following rules to spend these points and improve your ability scores, then assign the score to the specific abilities.

Improving the numbers 8-12 costs one point. As such, increasing the ""8"" to a ""12"" would cost 4 points. Improving a ""10"" to a ""13"" would cost only 3: one point each for 10-to-11, 11-to-12, and 12-to-13.
Improving the numbers 13-15 costs two points. As such, increasing the ""12"" from before would cost another point to become a ""13"", but an additional two points to improve to a ""14"". Similarly, improving the ""13"" to a ""16"" would cost 6 points: two each for 13-to-14, 14-to-15, and 15-to-16.
Improving a ""16"" to a ""17"" costs another three points.
Improving a ""17"" to an ""18"" costs another four points. As a result, upgrading a ""10"" to an ""18"" would cost a total of 16 points = 3*1 + 3*2 + 3 + 4.


The third method uses randomly-generated numbers and provides the most versatile and volatile scores. For each ability score, roll 4 6-sided dice (4d6). Add the three highest numbers, ignore the lowest, and assign the sum as an ability score.

,


Add or subtract these from the base stats. Once the base stats have been assigned after racial adjustments, assign each score an ability modifier, with either a plus or minus sign next to the base stat followed by the number. The table shows the ability modifiers:

Ad infinitum. At first level, 8 should be the lowest ability score and 18 the highest. Average scores are considered between 12-16.



, In the PHB, a list of skills to choose from can be found in chapter five. First, go to your classes' entry in the PHB in chapter four.

, These skills are the skills you are trained in, and each get a permanent +5 bonus.

, They can be found on page 178 of the PHB.

, Next to each skill ability, write down the skill points you currently have. Each skill point is equal to one-half of your level plus your ability score modifier and +5 if you are trained in that skill.


As an example, say you are playing a 1st-level human rogue with the following ability scores:

str 11 +0
con 10 +0
dex 16 +3
int 12 +1
wis 8 -1
cha 14 +2

A rogue is automatically trained in Thievery and Stealth, meaning he or she gets an automatic +5 points for both of those skills. They can also choose four of the following skills to be trained in:

Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Dungeoneering, Insight, Intimidate, Perception, and Streetwise.
As an example, Acrobatics, Bluff, Perception, and Streetwise were chosen to be trained skills. This means that the rogue currently has six skills he or she is trained in and has a permanent +5 bonus to. Since Acrobatics is a dexterity-based skill, the dexterity modifier of the rogue is added to the score, which is +3 in this case. Acrobatics is now equal to 8 total skill points.







,, At first level, you may choose one feat from chapter six. If you are human, you gain an additional feat. Feats provide static bonuses to characters, and bonuses of the same type do not stack together.

, If you do, you may choose the feat If you don't, you must wait until you meet the prerequisite.

, Powers are different kinds of attack your character can make and are divided into four categories: At-Will, Encounter, Daily, and Utility powers. ""At-Will"" powers can be used once per turn in an encounter indefinitely. ""Encounter"" powers can be used once per combat encounter. ""Daily"" powers can be used once per day.


Utility powers act like feats in that they give you static bonuses and certain advantages.
Each class in both the PHB and PHB2 list their powers in the same chapter. However, additional 4th edition d&d books are available for an extended list of available powers. The Martial Power handbook provides more

, The Arcane Power handbook provides more powers for arcane characters. The Primal Power handbook provides more powers for primal characters. The Martial Power Handbook provides more power to martial characters.


At first level, each player can choose 2 at-wills, 1 encounter, and 1 daily powers. You can choose 1 utility power at second level.

, At first level, you start with 100 gold pieces(gp) to spend on equipment. Chapter in the PHB provides you with a list of equipment to choose from. Purchase armor and weapons first, and then basic adventuring supplies. It's up to the party who carries what, unless you purchased all of your equipment on your own. Once these things are purchased, if you have any money left over you can choose to spend it on magic items, also found in chapter 7 in the PHB. The Adventurer's Vault Handbook provides an extension of supplies you can choose from as well.

, It is highly recommended you use a character sheet to record your player info, but it is not necessary. Regular paper can work as well.

,,,


Lawful Good means you follow the rules and do good.
Good means you do good, but does not necessarily mean you follow rules.
Chaotic Evil is ultimate evil. You can do anything you want if it is evil.
Evil means that you do evil, but you should follow rules.

, Initiative determines who goes in what order in a combat. Your initiative bonus is equal to one-half your level plus your dexterity modifier, and any bonuses or penalties that apply from armor or feats.

, Each of these defenses are equal to 10 plus one-half of your level plus the appropriate ability modifier. For armor class, add your armor bonus if any, and if you wear light armor add either your dex or int modifier, whichever of the two is higher. Fortitude uses the Str or Con modifier, Reflex uses the Dex or Int modifier, and Will uses the Wis or Cha modifier, whichever of the two is higher. If your class or race has any bonuses to these defenses, add them.

, Speed is determined by your character's race.

,, Passive perception and passive insight are the two most common passive senses. You have +10 in passive perception and passive insight at first level.

, Attack bonuses are equal to one-half your level plus your attack's ability score modifier plus any class bonuses plus any proficiencies with a weapon plus any feats plus any weapon enhancements. An attack bonus, also known as a to-hit bonus, is added onto a d20 roll whenever you make a specific attack.

, Your hit points are determined by your class. Your bloodied value is equal to half of your hit points. Your healing surges per day are determined by your class. Your healing surge value is equal to one-fourth of your total hit points.

Draw a # sign.,
Start writing your categories.,
Choose your options.,
Start counting.,
Go around your paper, stopping on that number.,
Cross off each option you land on.,
Stop when you have one of each category circled.",How to Play M.A.S.H2," That's a pound sign or a hashtag, depending on your generation. It should take up most of your paper -- you'll be writing in it for the game. It's really just like a giant tic-tac-toe board.








, You'll be using each area of the hashtag except for the middle. That means you'll need 8 categories. They can go in any order, but the standard ideas are (starting with the necessary ones):









M.A.S.H. (mansion, apartment, shack, house)
Who they'll marry
What their job is
Their means of transportation
Number of kids they'll have
Where they'll live
What their income is
The pet(s) they'll have

, This can depend on how many friends you're with or how you decide to play the game. There should be 4 options per category. To make it more fun, let the person whose fortune you're telling only pick one for each category.









Get creative. If you're choosing three means of transportation for your friend, think of things like ""goat,"" ""three-wheeled skateboard,"" or ""sneakers."" But know that they'll probably get you back when it's their turn!
Don't upset your friend. If they really don't want you to write Billy Bob on the to-be-married list, choose someone else.

, Start writing dots, tallies, or a spiral in the center of your tic-tac-toe/hashtag/pound sign. When your friend says, ""Stop!"" count how many marks you've made or times you've gone around. This is your number. Remember it.









If your friend is being cheeky and doesn't say ""stop"" for a long time and you end up with 52 dots, cut the number in half. You'll lose track if the number is too high!

, Start at the top left, with the first category being 1, 2, 3, and 4. If your number is 7, you'd stop on the 3rd option of the 2nd category.








, Resume again from where you left off, skipping over each already crossed-off option. As you go around and around, your options will start dwindling. When you cross off three in a category, circle the fourth -- you've determined the future!









Be sure to keep count accurately! Otherwise you'll end up with 101 kids instead of 3. That's a lot of mouths to feed.

, Then announce to the world, ""Hannah is going to marry George, live in China, be a diaper model, make $1 per day, have 17.2 kids, own a pet giraffe, fly an airplane, and live in a mansion!"" Just wait for the laughs/glares from your friends!









Then pass on the paper. Who's the next victim?!

Do Not Forget the Essential.,
Do Not Forget the Mundane.",How to Buy Starting Equipment for a Dungeons and Dragons V3.5 Character," This article covers the standard method to pick starting equipment for a 1st level character. Your DM may have something special in mind so before you spend the time picking your new equipment make sure that you are following the procedure that your DM requires.
, In the entry for each class near the end there are some starting character packages. In addition to some recommended starting skills and feats there is also a starting package of equipment. You can use the starting equipment package without using the recommended starting skills and feats. If you use a set package then you are done., On page 111 of the Player's Handbook (PHB) there is a table of starting gold values. Find your class and roll the appropriate dice. The number in parentheses is the average value of the roll, many DMs will allow or require you to use this number. Some players prefer to always take the average if they can because it is consistent., On page 162 of the PHB you will find the information on how much weight your character can carry this, in addition to monetary value, limits what you can buy. The table has the information for a medium sized, bipedal creature, if you are something different (such as the small sized Halving or Gnome) then you need to read about how to alter these numbers., All characters have starting clothing. This can be a artisan's, entertainer's, explorer's, monk's, peasant's, scholar's, or traveler's outfit. In addition to being free this outfit does not count as weight that you are carrying. Page 131 of the PHB describes all these various outfits. Wizards get their first spell book for free. The weight of this spellbook does count as carried weight however the book is free., To keep track of what you have spent and how much you are carrying you should make a list. There is room for this on the character sheet but because your inventory changes very often many people keep their list on a separate sheet of paper so that they do not damage the character sheet with frequent erasing. If you are so inclined this can be done very easily and neatly with a spreadsheet program on your computer., Most classes have certain items that they cannot use for some reason or another. You should always make sure that you have not purchased something that you cannot use. Once the campaign starts you cannot undo your starting decisions., Every item has a description of it in the equipment chapter. This description often includes important information that is not included in the table., Some items are essential for certain characters. For example, every character that can cast spells needs to carry a spell component pouch. This pouch contains the little odd bits and pieces that are required to cast many of the spells in D&D., On pages 128-9 of the PHB there are several mundane items that adventurers can purchase. These things may seem rather silly at times, such as soap, however you may never know when you will need one of these items. At higher levels you can often replace these items with magic, but not at lower levels. At this point you must consider the style of campaign you are in. Some players resent other players who do not buy items such as a bedroll and soap that most characters should have but there are no game rules concerning. You need to know what the attitudes of the other players are, as well as how detailed you want to be about your character."

Most basic yo yos of a reasonable level of quality should be able to perform a sleeper without any problems. However, some cheap ""toy"" yo yos which are poorly constructed may be almost impossible to perform a sleeper with. If you have one of these types of yo yos, consider upgrading to a higher-quality model to make it much easier to do sleepers and any other tricks that you may want to try.


While certain high-end yo yo models can be expensive, most serviceable ordinary yo yos won't cost you more than $10-$20. For a stronger spin, consider buying a model with metal construction or added bearings — the extra weight gives the yo yo more momentum as it spins, making longer sleepers possible.;
, The sleeper begins in almost exactly the same way as the basic yo yo move called the gravity throw, so it’s useful to become confident with this simple technique before trying the sleeper. Though it may sound intimidating, the gravity throw is anything but — it’s just the basic “up and down” motion that almost anyone can do with a yo yo. Though this move isn’t terribly tricky, learning the proper technique for a gravity throw will make doing a sleeper much easier.


To do a gravity throw, hold the yo yo upright in your dominant hand, palm-up. Make a motion like you’re flexing your bicep, then bring your forearm back down and let the yo yo roll out of your hand. Turn your hand over to catch the yo yo as it hits the bottom of its string and bounces back up.

, To do a sleeper, you'll begin exactly as you would for a gravity throw. Loop the yo yo's string loosely around the middle finger of your dominant hand. Hold it upright in your palm so that the skinny end is sitting against the flesh of your hand. Curl your fingers around it slightly to support it. Hold the yo yo out in front of you with your elbow bent and at your side.

, Make a motion like you're flexing your bicep by curling your hand and forearm up towards your shoulder. For extra power, you can even lift your elbow so that it's roughly level with the floor (or even past this point). In one smooth motion, roll your forearm and hand downward and let the yo yo roll off of your fingers as you throw it at the ground. This motion should be quick and powerful, but fluid. The harder you throw the yo yo, the longer it will ""sleep.""


Turn your hand over so that your palm is facing the floor after you throw your yo yo so that you have greater control over the string and can eventually catch the yo yo when it comes back up (this motion should come fairly naturally).
Don't hold on to the yo yo too tightly — keep your grip loose throughout your throwing motion. You're trying to get the yo yo to roll off of your hand and fly directly at the ground. If you grip the yo yo tightly and release it only as you throw it down, it may fly diagonally, rather than straight down, giving your sleeper a wobbly pendulum-like motion.

, Unlike with a gravity throw, you won't want to yank the yo yo back up after you throw it — simply let it hit the bottom of its string. The yo yo should begin spinning smoothly and quietly at the end of the string. It should usually remain upright as it spins without much effort on your part, but if your initial throw was subpar or your string is wound too tightly, it may begin to wobble. In these cases, you may need to subtly pull the yo yo in the opposite direction to prevent it from losing its balance.

, Congratulations — you've just done 90% of a sleeper. Now all you need to do is ""wake the yo yo up"" (in other words, get it to return to your hand). For most basic models, all you'll need to do is give the yo yo a small, sharp upward tug. The yo yo should ""catch"" the string and work its way back up toward your hand. If your yo yo doesn't seem to have enough ""strength"" to climb the string all the way, try throwing it harder to give it more spin. Grab it as it reaches the top of the string and you're done!


Some modern yo yos (especially high-end models) sacrifice the ability to climb back into your hand for longer, smoother spinning. If you have this sort of yo yo, it may be difficult or impossible to get it back from a sleeper simply by jerking it up. Instead, you may need to use a special technique called a “bind” to generate enough friction for the yo yo to climb the string. See below for more information.

, Making just a few minor changes to the way you hold your yo yo can make the difference between ""so-so"" sleepers that fizzle out after ten seconds and sleepers that spin for a minute or longer. For the best results, try to maintain a loose grasp on the yo yo with your middle finger, index finger, ring finger, and thumb before your throw. Curl your fingers up under the yo yo and bring your thumb around the backside to stabilize it. Keep your wrist loose before and during your throw — it should move freely, independent of your forearm.


For the best sleepers, you'll also want to be sure that the string is on the outside edge of the yo yo, rather than the inside. In other words, you want the yo yo's string to wind around the top of the yo yo, rather than around the bottom. This allows the yo yo to roll smoothly out of your hand when you throw it. On the other hand, if the string winds around the yo yo backwards, the added strain can make your sleeper be somewhat ""wobbly"" or tilted.

, As noted above, in general, the harder you throw your yo yo at the floor, the faster and longer it will spin. For basic sleepers, you probably won't need your yo yo to spin for all that long, but when you advance to complicated tricks, you may need to be able to count on having a minute or more of solid spin time. Because of this, it's wise to get in the habit of throwing your yo yo with a good amount of force early. However, no matter how hard you throw your yo yo, you'll want to use proper technique to keep it under control — in other words, use the loose bicep-flexing throwing motion described above.


As an example of what's possible with good throwing technique, expert yo yo-ers with good yo yos can achieve sleepers that spin for over 10 minutes. Some professional-grade yo yos are even advertised as being able to achieve a spin time over 30 minutes!, You may have noticed that, occasionally, the yo yo will climb back up the string when you try to do a sleeper even if you don't jerk it up. This happens when the yo yo hits the end of its string, runs out of slack, and bounces back upwards, catching the string again. To avoid this problem, try giving the yo yo a subtle jerk before it hits the end of its string. This puts a little slack in the string, making the yo yo hit the bottom of its path with less force and reducing the chance it will bounce back up.


It can be tricky to get the timing on this move perfect, so practice plenty. For the best results, you want to jerk somewhat gently just before the yo yo hits the bottom of the string, when it's about three-quarters of the way down.

, As mentioned above, some professional-grade yo yos are constructed in a way that deliberately sacrifices the ability for the yo yo to climb back up the string in order to make it easier to perform advanced tricks. If you have this sort of yo yo, you'll need to perform a special move called a bind to be able to get the yo yo back into your hand after a sleeper. The basic goal of this technique is to put a small loop into the string as it winds up, which creates enough friction for the yo yo to ""catch"" the string and start climbing up the string. To perform a bind:


Start by throwing an ordinary sleeper. Use your free hand to grab the string a few inches above the spinning yo yo.
Keep holding onto the string while you swing the yo yo under the fingers of your free hand and catch it on the string. This should leave you with the yo yo still spinning at the lowest point of a checkmark shape formed by the two string sections.
Gently pull on the string connected to your throwing hand to pull the yo yo closer to the fingers on your free hand grabbing the doubled-up string section.
When the yo yo gets too close to keep holding on, let go with your free hand. The string should catch on itself and the yo yo should climb the string back into your hand.

, As noted above, for experienced yo yo-ers, the sleeper is usually performed merely as a small part of a more complicated trick, rather than as a trick on its own. Once you've mastered the basic sleeper, you may want to try learning some of these more advanced tricks to expand your repertoire. For instance, ""walking the dog"" is an intermediate-level trick that involves throwing a basic sleeper and gently lowering the spinning yo yo until it just touches the floor. When it catches on the ground, the yo yo should skip or roll forward like a dog on a leash! Jerk the yo yo back into your hand to end the trick.

, This trick involves making a ""cradle"" with the string and swinging the yo yo through it like a miniature pendulum. To rock the baby:Start by throwing a basic sleeper. Use your free hand to pull the string between the index finger and thumb of your throwing hand as if you're drawing a bow. This should create a large loop.
Use the fingers on your free hand to spread this loop, then move your free hand downward to turn the shape vertical. The still-spinning yo yo should swing back and forth through the gap in the loop.
Drop the string and jerk the yo yo back into your hand to end the trip.

, Perhaps one of the oldest, most well-known yo yo tricks in the book, the around the world involves swinging the yo yo in a large vertical circle like a Ferris wheel. To perform an around the world:


Start by throwing a modified sleeper out in front of you (rather than down towards the floor) in a move called a ""forward pass"". With your yo yo in your hand at your side, bring your arm forward as you uncurl your wrist and allow the yo yo to roll off of your fingers.
When the yo yo hits the end of its string, pull it up over your head and behind you in one fluid motion. Let the yo yo complete a single complete circle, or, if you're feeling confident, feel free to give it another ""trip"" around the world.
When you're ready to stop, wait until the yo yo is out in front of you, then jerk it back towards your body and catch it.

, This intimidatingly-named trick can require some serious practice, but it looks amazing when it's perfected. To perform a brain twister:Begin by getting your yo yo into the same checkmark-shaped string arrangement as you would use when performing a bind.
Move your free hand up and around to the other side of the throwing hand string. Pull back on the strings with your throwing hand index finger, then move your throwing hand up and fling your yo yo over the top of both hands.
Let the yo yo swing out and away from you and back down underneath your hands. You can stop here or keep swinging the yo yo for additional revolutions.
When you're done, drop the yo yo back into its starting position and let it climb back into your hand.
With each revolution, the string will wind around your throwing hand finger. Point your finger toward the yo yo as it climbs the string to allow the string to unspool and the yo yo to climb back into your hand.

Become comfortable with the rules of the game.,
Find out what everyone else in the group is interested in playing.,
Even if the party desperately wants you to play something they are missing (Who's going to be the Cleric?,
Coming up with a background and a reason to be in the group makes for better roleplaying.,
Think about the decisions your character makes.,
Experiment!,
Accents!!!,
Interact with others in character!,
Think about what goals your character has and what goals you have for the character.",How to Choose a Character to Play in a Roleplaying Game," Each game has it's own ""flavor"" and part of having fun with your character is knowing what is and what isn't possible within the game and the world. In some games it is easy to be a brave warrior, in others a lone soldier is nearly impossible to play in an entertaining way.;
, In many games having a good combination of professions or powers is key to having a successful adventure. So ask around, find out what others are interested in playing. Are you all interested in playing thieves from the seedy part of town? Brave warriors out to carve an empire from the uncaring world? Priests out to restore hope to a bleak world? Dutiful knights or samurai, upholding the precepts of their religion or codes of conduct? In most games it helps if players choose roles, professions or classes that complement one another. If your friend Roy wants to play a Marine and Dawn wants to play the Alien Diplomat, perhaps you should choose a character that would fill this group out. Perhaps a shape-shifting spy, a hard-bitten medic or the reckless-but-skilled pilot.

,), never let yourself be forced into playing a character you don't think you want to play. If you feel up to the challenge of playing something you've never tried to before, good for you! You have the makings of a great roleplayer. But being forced to play a role you are uncomfortable with isn't acceptable. This is a social game and everyone should be having fun. A good game master should offer to create an NPC to fill in missing professions in the party. (NPC = Non-Player Character, someone the gamemaster will play as a member of your adventuring group).

, This isn't necessary in all games, but people who play a lot of roleplaying games will expect at least some effort at a background. Choose a character from a movie or book or a daydream, change it a bit to suit the game and have fun! A good background can really make the game a lot more exciting and will help you 'get into character' much faster, thus making the game more interesting for you. The best backgrounds should have 'hooks', or plot devices the game master can use in future adventures. If your character learned martial arts from a secret sect of monks, but betrayed them when he found out their methods were evil (Batman, in one version at least) then you can expect that the gamemaster will have them show up and cause you problems at some point!

, These decisions will add up and will eventually define your character. Is your character the type to drink away his hard earned cash? Save up for things he wants? Give his money to charity? These things end up defining your character and will, in many ways, decide his ultimate legacy in the world. The Holy Warrior who gives his money to help orphans may lose out when it comes to having fun in town or may not have the ""best"" equipment, but his kindness may result in assistance from places you never expected it, and may result in the character's name outliving the character himself! Moral decisions are key roleplaying events.

, Some players, who are painfully nice in real life really enjoy playing ""dark"" characters in games. As long as it doesn't disrupt the game for the other players then it should generally be allowed. The consequences, good or bad, should be appropriate though. ;) A roleplaying game is a great chance to not only let off some steam through imaginary combat, but also a good place to play around with philosophies and worldviews that are at odds with your own.

, It doesn't matter if you are TERRIBLE at it, even a poor attempt at an accent can really spice up a character. It takes practice, but suffer through the groans and mild protests of your friends and give it a shot. It takes some time but eventually you'll at least be making a recognizable (if not entirely believable) accent! Watch some TV shows or movies with the accent you want to do and try saying things the way they do. Italian Gangster, English Fop, French Resistance fighter... all pretty easy accents to play up and have fun with.

, If your character never speaks to anyone, shies away from conflict or discussion or decisions, then you will never really have fun with it. Talk with NPCs or other characters in the voice and manner your character would.

, These can be long term or short term. Does your character want fame? Look for ways that can happen in the game and ask the game master to give you some opportunities for fame in the adventures he/she plans. What do YOU want for your character to be eventually? The best marksman in the galaxy? Does he just want to settle an old score? Find true love? Defeat an enemy? Overcome a character flaw in himself?

Kill Wally No.",How to Become a Sheath Knight in Elsword," There are two parts of the quest in order for you to become a Sheath Knight. First, you need to take the Knighthood chain quest in order to unlock the next phase.









Before anything, remember that in order for this quest to be available, you need to use Elsword that is Level 15 or above. Otherwise, the quest won't appear in your Quest Log. If you're qualified, go to Elder Village to talk to Lenphad.
Lenphad is the Equipment Shop NPC found at the upper right of the map, a few steps away from Echo, the Alchemist.;
, After talking to Lenphad, he will give you a set of quests to be completed before turning you into a Knight.









Your first task will be killing 15 Bomber Mongs at the Suburb of Wally's Castle. There's no difficulty limit. You can do this quest either in solo or with party.
It's more advisable to take the quest under Hard Level or Higher to finish the other quest within one dungeon run.

, Aside from killing 15 Bomber Mongs, Lenphad will also ask you to kill 14 Jango and Kid Phoru at the Suburb of Wally's Castle. However, this kill quest is only available in Hard or Higher Dungeon Level so make sure to do this with a party rather than hunting alone.









Kid Phoru monsters are the ones who uses torch to burn you while Jango uses melee attack. They appear in every floor, even summoned at the last floor of the Castle.
As mentioned at the second quest, this can be completed along with the 15 Bomber Mongs.

, After you have completed the quest, go back to Elder Village and speak to the Accessory Shop Owner, Luichel. This NPC can be found at the west part of the village, just near the field portal.









She will reward you for your hard work and then give you the last quest for Knighthood. Before jumping into the dungeon, make sure you have bought enough potions and repair all your equipment.

, The last part of the Knighthood quest requires you to complete Wally's Castle within 15 minutes under the Very Hard level. This quest can be done with a party or even with players with higher base level compared to the dungeon.









If you know anyone who is already Level 30 or more, you can ask for their help to clear the dungeon before the given time runs out. After the completion of your quest, head back to NPC Luichel and she will turn you into a Knight.

, After completing the Knight Chain Quest, you can now choose either Sword Knight, Magic Knight, or Sheath Knight. For this, choose Sheath Knight by talking to Hoffman, or through your Quest Log which can be found at the lower right menu.









Hoffman is the Great Merchant of Elder Village, found at the upper level, middle of the map, and next to Luriel. Before he change your job to Sheath Knight, he will give you three tests in different dungeons.

, Under the Very Hard Level, your first quest requires you to enter the Underground Waterway, slay the monsters and complete the dungeon run within 10 minutes.









This is easier to complete if you have a full house party or with characters which huge DPS such as Mage and Archer. Aside from having a full house raid, you can ask your high level friends to help you or search for aid from Guild Members.

, On the second part, go back to the Suburb of Wally's Castle but this time, you are required to kill the monsters and clear the dungeon under the Very Hard Level with no time limit.









You can finish the raid while in a group or party, so take your time in completing this part and make sure to keep your eye out for any rare drop.

, 8. Wally's Castle is the last dungeon in the Elder Village map. The map will be unlocked if you have successfully cleared the Suburb Wally's Castle.









For the last leg of the quest, you are required to collect a quest item from Wally No. 8. This item will be automatically picked up and counted but the drop rate can be very low depending on the character's luck. Because of the low drop rate, it's advisable to do the dungeon run with your high level friends or guild mates.
Aside from collecting the quest item, this must be done under the Very Hard Level only, or else the quest item won't drop.
After completing the quest, return to Hoffman in the Elder Village and he will change you into a Sheath Knight.

, Enter the Underground Waterway under the Very Hard mode to collect 10 Dead Tree Branches and 30 Runic Power Crystal from the Ghost Magician and White Ghost Magician, respectively.


The task is fairly easy, especially if you're in a party for quick raid.

, Buy these from the Potion NPC in Elder Village.

, The Suburbs of Wally's Castle can be found in Elder Village map. Enter the dungeon under Very Hard mode and do the following:


Kill 14 Jangos and 14 Kid Phorus
Clear the dungeon with B rank.
Collect 3 Quest Items from Bomber Mongs and 1 Special Nut from William

, After you have completed the quest, return to the village and check your Quest Log. Hand in your quest items by clicking Complete Quest, or talk to the bulletin board found in the low middle level of the village.


You can now proceed to choosing the quest for one of the three advance classes for Aisha.

, Stationed at the highest middle level of the village, an NPC named Hoffman will be waiting for you. Talk to him regarding your class-advancement change and then choose which class you're going to take.


Choose Battle Magician; he will then give you a set of tasks to complete.

, Enter the Suburbs of Wally's Castle under Very Hard mode to hunt for this item.


The strategy for this is to go through the dungeon with a party, preferably your friends. Rush to the last floor where you get to fight the boss, William, as he's the only monster that drops the required quest item.
If you're unable to get the pendant, you have to repeat the raid until you succeed. Skipping other floors will save you time, but you will miss mini bosses and useful loots.

, For the next leg of the quest, you're required to kill monsters in the dungeon of Elder Village. This includes the final boss, Wally No.8.


You must enter Wally’s Castle under Very Hard mode.
Wally's Castle has a lot of floors, so make sure to enter each of them to find mini bosses. These mini bosses drop rare items that you'll find useful in survival and a good source of gold if you plan on selling it to other players.
It is recommended to enter this dungeon with a party, then enter each floor to clear it of all monsters before heading for the final boss.
There is no time limit for this quest.

, After completing the quest, return to Elder Village to hand your quest item to Hoffman, or simply open your Quest Log and click Complete Quest.


Your character will instantly change its class to Battle Magician after giving the quest item to Hoffman or clicking on Complete Quest in your Quest Log.
Take note that there's a small bug: if your character didn't change its class despite of completing and handing in the quest item, log off then log in again to fix this.

, Stunning your enemies is one of the new combos for Battle Magician and is found the most useful when dealing one-on-one combat. By pressing arrow toward your enemy twice, your character will start running. Press Up to jump and then X to release a small energy ball ( >> or <<, Up, X ).


This attack can cancel the enemy's skill and make them vulnerable to combo attacks.
This skill will only cause your opponent to twitch, not knock them down.
The downfall of this is that, compared to the basic Aisha's Fireball, the energy ball travels slow. #*This skill is best used when in close combat.

, A lot of players prefer skills that won't knock down their enemy as they can do more skill combos and juggle. However, for Battle Magician, it is important to have a knock-down attack to prevent the enemy from getting too close.


Knock your enemies down by pressing Z four times; your Battle Magician will execute her basic combo. Once hit, the enemy will be knocked down at the fourth Z ( Z, Z, Z, Z ).

, If the knock-down isn't enough, you can throw the enemy into the air. It's similar to Aisha's old skill, but much better with an addition of teleportation and bigger physical damage.


To do this, dash toward your enemy by pressing the arrow twice, press Z to hit with melee attack, followed by X three times ( >> or <<, Z, X, X, X ). Your Battle Magician will teleport behind the enemy then unleash a skill to throw them off the ground.
This is a bit difficult to execute compared to the other combos, but it inflicts the highest damage once successfully performed.

, The King will always be the detective, and there should be one King. The Queen will always be the Doctor, and there should be one Queen. Choose a suit (such as Clubs) to be the Mafia. There should be 1 mafia member per 3 villagers, rounded down. Put those three types in the deck, along with enough regular cards for everyone else except for the moderator.

, The card that is picked is the character that that person plays. When everyone has taken and looked at their cards, the moderator will begin the game.

, The game begins with a day cycle, in which the Mafia do not yet know who the other Mafia members are.

,, The people who have the mafia cards will open their eyes and decide amongst themselves (as quietly as possible) who they want to kill. They inform the moderator of who their victim is (by pointing to him or her) and the moderator will then tell the Mafia to go back to sleep.

, The sheriff will then point out one person that they suspect to be a Mafia member and the moderator will silently indicate (through a thumbs-up or thumbs-down) whether or not that that person is a member of the Mafia. If the Sheriff was right he eliminates the Mafia member and if he was wrong he knows another innocent (apart from himself or a person he chose wrongly on one of the previous nights). The moderator will then instruct the sheriff to return to sleep. Note: In an alternative way to play, the Sheriff/Detective does not automatically eliminate the Mafia member he/she has identified. Rather, it is up to the sheriff to convince the townspeople the next day who the Mafia member is.

, The doctor will then (silently) point to a one person to save. He/she could also choose to save himself (or herself). If the person chosen to be killed by the mafia was saved, they will survive the night. Otherwise, nothing will happen to the person saved and the person killed will die. If the doctor dies, the townspeople can no longer be saved from the mafia.

,, The townspeople (this includes, sheriff, and Mafia) should discuss recent events. Nobody may show their cards, although they can try to convince others that they are a certain role. Once the discussion has evolved to a point where somebody has a suspicion, play proceeds to accusations.

, At this point, someone may make an accusation against another player stating that they think that the other person is part of the Mafia. Once an accusation has been made, it must be seconded by another player in order for the accusation to be taken to a vote. When someone has been accused and seconded, the accuser must explain the reasoning behind the accusation. Then other players may speak if they believe that the accusation is just.

, At this point, anyone who chooses to may defend the accused and the accused then has the right to defend him or herself and explain why there is no way that he or she could possibly be part of the Mafia. This can take place in a trial-like setting, where the accused talks about a fictional alibi and often accuses other players in his or her stead. Player's may cite their relationship to other players as a reason why they could not be in the mafia.

, The moderator now asks who thinks that the accused is guilty and a vote is taken. The voting process may or may not be anonymous.

, If a majority of the voting players vote guilty, the accused shows his or her card and is now considered killed. If no cards were used, the accused may simply state whether or not they are in the mafia. If there is not a majority vote of guilty, the accusations begin again. The day round continues until someone has been declared guilty and removed from the game, and the night round begins again.

, In one variation of the day cycle, no accusations or discussions take place. If the person was killed, the moderator makes up a story about who was killed, and how, without revealing who the killer(s) were. If the person was saved, the moderator explains how they were injured, found, and saved. (also without revealing any information about who the killer(s) were). This variation allows for some room to be creative, and have fun."

Enchantment: These spells influence the minds of others. All of these spells are mind-affecting.
Evocation: These spells manipulate energy and force. These spells are often spectacular to see and deal large amounts of damage.
Illusion: These spells come from the sub-schools; figment, gamer, pattern, phantasm, and shadow. Each sub-school has different characteristics.
Necromancy: These spells deal with life, death, and life force. Contrary to the common first impression, not all of these spells are evil.
Transmutation: These spells change the properties of the target, sometimes even changing its physical type and shape.



Descriptor: This is found on the same line as the school and sub-school. This is a further classification of the spell. This may be an energy type, such as fire, or an alignment type, such as chaotic, or other similar classifications.

Level: This is the spell's level, a number from 0 to 9. This is how we know the spell's relative power. This line includes what level the spell is for any class that can cast it. The abbreviations are Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Rogue, Sorcerer, and Wizard. One spell may be a different level for different classes; for example ""Antipathy"" is Druid 9 Sorcerer/Wizard 8. This means that the spell is level 8 for sorcerers and wizards but level 9 for druids. The other spell casting classes cannot cast this spell.

Components: These are the things that must be present to cast the spell. You must do or have these actions and items with you when you cast the spell.

(V) Verbal: This means that you must speak to cast the spell. This means speaking in a loud strong voice.
(S) Somatic: This means that you must make gestures with your hand to cast the spell. If you cannot move at least one hand, then you cannot cast the spell.
(M) Material: This is some item that you must have on hand to cast the spell. If there is no cost listed for the item then it is contained in a spell component pouch.
(F) Focus: A focus is a material object needed to cast the spell that is not consumed in the casting and therefore can be reused. Again, if no cost is listed, then it is in the spell component pouch.
(DF) Divine Focus: This is a spiritually significant focal object. For Clerics and Paladins this is the holy symbol.
(XP) Experience Point Cost: Some extremely powerful spells will drain some experience points from the caster whenever they are used. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a level, so if you cannot cast the spell without losing a level then you cannot cast the spell.



Casting Time: This is how long it takes to cast the spell. Almost every spell takes one standard action, however some spells take more or less time. Spells with a one round casting time take a full-round action to cast. You begin at the start of one turn and spell comes into effect just before the start of your next turn. You must maintain concentration during the casting of any spell that takes one round or longer. A spell that is a free action to cast may be cast on your turn but does not take away from your turn, you may only cast one of these spells a turn. Spells that take one immediate action may be cast as a free action even when it is not your turn, you still may only cast one per turn. You make all decisions regarding a spell, such as its target, when the spell comes into effect not when you start casting it.

Range: This is how far you can reach with the spell.

Personal: You can only cast these spells on yourself.
Touch: You must touch whatever is to be affected with the spell. If the target does not want to receive the spell you must make a touch attack. Touch attack spells threaten a critical hit on a roll of 20 and deal double damage on a successful critical hit.
Close: These spells have a range of 25 feet (7.6 m) + 5ft/2 levels. So, 30 feet (9.1 m) at level 2, 35ft at level 4, and so on.
Medium: These spells have a range of 100 feet (30.5 m) + 10ft/level. So, 110 feet (33.5 m) at level 1, 120ft at level 2, and so on.
Long: These spells have a range of 400 feet (121.9 m) + 40ft/level. So, 440 feet (134.1 m) at level 1, 480ft at level 2, and so on.
Unlimited: These spells can target anything that can be located.
Specified: Some spells have a maximum range specified in feet. These spells have the same maximum range no matter the level of the caster.

;
,


Target(s): You need to specify a target or targets within range.
Effect: This means a summoned object or creature, a ray which is targeted with a ranged touch attack, or a spread which has a designated point of origin.
Area: Area spells fall into one of the following categories; burst/emanation spells which need a point of origin and affect everything within the radius, cone/cylinder/line/sphere spells affect everything inside the designated shape. If the area/effect entry has an (S) it means the spell is shapeable. Shaped spells have no part smaller than a 10 feet (3.0 m) cube.

,


Timed: These spells have a set duration, often based on the caster's level, and the spell ends when the duration expires.
Instantaneous: These spells come and go in an instant, but the consequences are often long lasting.
Permanent: This spell remains in effect for ever, however since the duration continues, the spell is vulnerable to dispelling unlike instantaneous spells.
Concentration: These spells last as long as the caster concentrates on the spell, which requires a standard action each round.
Subjects, Effects, and Areas: These spells remain in effect on the targeted point, creature, or object.
Discharge: Some spells last until the duration expires or until the caster discharges it.
(D) Dismissible: These spells can be ended before the set duration ends. Doing so is a standard action on the part of the caster.

, This section explains which applies to this spell.


Negates: If the target makes the saving throw then there is no effect.
Partial: Making a saving throw causes a less serious effect.
Half: The spell deals half damage to anyone who makes their saving throw.
None: There is no save allowed.
Disbelief: If the target succeeds on a saving throw then it ignores the effect.
(Harmless): These spells are beneficial.

, Some spells are subject to it, and some are not. If the entry says yes then the spell is subject to SR, if the entry says no then it is not subject to SR. The entry may contain other details as well. A caster must roll a caster level check (caster level + 1d20) to meet or exceed the target's SR.

, This is essentially a ""quick and dirty"" guide to magic, just to get you started. Ideally, you will want to read the full details for each of these characteristics of a spell after you've gotten a taste for playing D&D. You do not need to understand everything about all spells, but you should understand the ideas that apply to spells that your character can cast.

, In mundane, non-piratey MMORPG language, an ocean would be called a ""server"". The oceans are distinct and separate.


Subscriber Ocean: A subscriber ocean is an ocean in which a user has to pay for a subscription regularly to enjoy the game completely. Subscription has to be bought using real money and not the virtual game money (PoE). Subscription can be bought on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.

The Cerulean Ocean is the only subscriber ocean open for players. It was formed through a merger of the former Midnight and Cobalt Oceans on January 31st, 2012.



Doubloon Oceans: Doubloon oceans do not require a subscription. But players playing on doubloon oceans use two types of in-game currency: PoE and doubloons. PoE can be earnt by doing various activities in the game. Doubloons can either be exchanged for PoE or bought using real money. Many users who decide not to spend real money on this game choose doubloon oceans.

The Emerald Ocean is a doubloon ocean that was formed through a merger of the former Sage and Hunter Oceans on January 31st, 2012. The emerald is currently the most populated ocean in the game.
The Meridian Ocean is a doubloon ocean that was formed through a merger of the former Malachite and Viridian Oceans on January 31st, 2012. Meridian is the oldest, and the second most populated ocean in the game.
The Opal Ocean was the fourth doubloon ocean and opened on December 8th 2006. Opal is a German language ocean. Being a German language ocean, Opal ocean is scarcely populated.
The Jade Ocean was the sixth doubloon ocean and opened on July 1, 2009. Jade is a Spanish language ocean. The population of the Jade ocean is similar to the one of Opal ocean.


Most players prefer to play on Doubloon Oceans as almost everything can be played for free. Even doubloons can be bought in exchange for PoE, the basic monetary unit. PoE can be earnt by playing different puzzles, winning tournaments, events, blockades, pillages, stalls, etc.

Finally, finish up by building a few farms to support your population and ambitions.",How to Build a Settlement in Brunelleschi: Age of Architects," This is assuming that you've already created both an account and a Lord character.;
, If you are a new character or have recently moved to the Wilderness, the blue Move button is quite large. Otherwise it is in the upper center strip of buttons on your settlement page.

, This is at the bottom of the Relocate window that appears. The button reads ""Found a New Settlement""

, You can name yours whatever you want, from Holy Rome to Doomopolis.

, Take your first actions as the sovereign of your new settlement.

, To do this, hit the Population tab in the box on the right side of your screen. As you can see, Altaron has 10 Peers, 50 Yeomen, and 100 Peasants with room for 100 more. But this isn't nearly enough for a flourishing community.

, You've got two routes for that from your settlement page. Either click on the Fields in your map or click the Fields icon and then the green Go to District button in the right hand box.

, Latifundia is your first important population building and the first way you have to get more precious Peers for your work force. Select the 'Blueprint' tab. Inside the Blueprints menu, select Exclusive Building from the upper buttons. The Latifundia info will appear in the right hand box behind the windows. Select Construct Now. All new Sovereigns have enough Produce to build at least Latifundia at the start.

Understand what a DM does.,
Know the rules.,
Prepare properly.,
Take notes.,
Be willing to make mistakes.,
Follow the Golden Rule of DMing: The players will always do something you never thought of and could never have anticipated in a million years.,
Be involved, creative and reasonably realistic.",How to Be a Dungeon Master," The descriptions you may have heard of a Dungeon Master probably range from ""the one who does all the work"" to ""You are god here"". Those descriptions are usually exaggerations from people who are either ignorant of what a DM really is or the extreme interpretation of a half-truth.


As a DM, you control everything and everyone that is not a Player Character (PC for short). That means everyone or anything the players may come across or interact with is controlled by you. However, the goal of any RPG should be a fun time for ‘’’everyone’’’ involved. ""Everyone"" cannot be stressed enough. Your responses to the players, the situations you present, the challenges you create, the stories you build together, all of it should be balanced so as to provide an enjoyable experience for you and your players. What you are not is against the PCs. If your goal is to destroy the player characters any chance you get, then you are doing it wrong. Rather, you should strive to be fair and create an enjoyable experience. This means that if the characters are having a hard time, nerf the monsters but don’t change how they would behave.;
, To be a fair DM, you are expected to have a strong grasp of the rules of the game. It may be helpful to think of yourself as an impartial judge in this respect. Just as a judge cannot do his/her job without knowing the law, a DM cannot run the game without knowing the rules of the game. To aid in this, most RPGs provide basic entry books known as ""Core"" rulebooks. Anything considered Core is what you need to have, at very least, a passing familiarity with.


In D&D, the Core Books are the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master Guide and the Monster Manual. The rest should not be considered necessary for running a game.
You describe the surroundings, manage the plot, and administer all of the elements of the game, including determining the outcome of battles between players and dungeon dwellers. If your players encounter a creature, choose a plan of battle, it may be up to you to roll the dice to decide the outcome, and although the rules apply specific guidelines, you may use your own judgment to work that outcome in the best way to maintain the flow and continuity of the game. It's a daunting task, but it will become easier with time, patience, and practice.

, For some DMs, the thrill of writing their own adventures and stories to present to their players is the reason for doing it. Others like the fact that they control everything. And then there are those who do it simply because they don’t think anyone else will do a good enough job. Regardless of why you do it, how you get ready is what breaks or makes the game. The ways you can prepare could fill its own wiki, but here are the basics for first time DMs. Remember that everyone will be comfortable with different ways and it is best to only use what works for you. Don't try to force something that doesn't feel right. Again, the end result should always be a fun game for everyone. If it feeIs like work, don't hesitate to lower your work pace.


If you have no time in between games, consider running modules. They will be presented for characters between a certain levels, with challenges scaled to fit. This is the easiest and fastest way to run a game, as most of everything is done for you. The only thing you have to do is read the adventure. It is suggested that you re-read a few pages ahead of where you stopped at every session right before the next session, to refresh your memory for the game at hand.
If you have a few hours to devote between games, running modules is still a strong option. However, you may want to re-write parts of the module to fit the game or particular story line(s) you're running with the PCs. Changing descriptions of locations or replacing treasure found in the module with items better suited for your players are good and easy places to start. As you progress in skill, you may start lifting whole encounters from one module and writing it into another. Not only does this allow you to essentially pick out the best parts of an otherwise so-so module, but players who may have read or run through the module before will be in for a surprise!
Writing your own adventures is a possibility, though for new DMs it is still recommended that you run a module first, so you're only focusing on one concept at a time (learning the rules). In time you will be more inclined to change things and write new scenarios yourself. Pulling encounters from published works and tying them together would be a good start. They can then slowly be replaced with your own works. What you ultimately want to achieve is that your campaign is like a movie you would be interested in watching which invokes a sense of mystery.
Many dungeon masters spend a long time reading the rulebooks over and over again. This is actually a form of procrastination. If you don't have anyone to play with – don't spend time planning scenarios. Keep your ideas in the back of your mind and instead learn to generally become a good storyteller. The only way to become a valuable game master is to gain practical experience and learn from each mistake as it brings you closer to perfection.

, During and immediately after the game session, be sure to jot down a few notes about what the players did, what your NPCs did, how your other NPCs and bad guys will respond to new events, the names of NPCs you may have made up on the fly, and any other details you may find important.

, Sometimes things will not go as you plan. Whether it is a mistake on how a rule works, or confusion of how a spell would affect an NPC, or your carefully written adventure is thrown aside by players that think a random NPC you had nothing written for is FAR more interesting than your save-the-maiden quest, problems will occur. Frequently. The best tool any DM has in their toolkit is the ability AND willingness to adjust to the circumstances.


If the problem is a rule disagreement, don't let that derail your game. Spend no more than two minutes looking up anything, unless the character in question may die from the result. Calmly explain your ruling on how it will work, resolve to look it up after the game or between sessions and move on. Nothing kills a game faster than bickering for 15 minutes between two people while the rest of the group is bored. Keeping the game going is better than killing the game while trying to get every detail right every time.
If the problem is that the players did something that you didn't plan for, anticipate, or want them to do... be willing to say ""Yes""... or at the very least don't say ""No"". Some DMs can make things up on the fly - do so if you can. If you're not comfortable with that, ask for a short break (people can go to the bathroom, eat, whatever) while you write up some ideas and make a short outline plan for this new and exciting direction they are going.
Don't excuse yourself if the players catch you with having broken Dungeons & Dragons-rules. If they point out that your wizard wears chain mail, agree, be mysterious about it.
There is no tragedy in retconning if you forgot an important aspect.

, No matter how many solutions or tangents you plan for, it is likely they will go in the one you did not. It is best that you accept this reality now, otherwise you're setting yourself up for pretty frequent frustration when it happens... over, and over, and over... Don't be discouraged by this though! This detail keeps the game exciting and surprising for you, which can be very enjoyable.


The players can be their own worst enemies. Their dreadful imagination can give you inspiration about your scenario and how it unfolds.
If the players roll a lucky dice and kill off what you intended to be the main villain, let him go. Being fair also means denying yourself.
If you really don’t want the players to go in a certain direction there are ways of changing it. You can make certain areas contagious which also yields an opportunity for roleplaying. A realm can be controlled by a dark lord. Or areas you don't want them to visit can be excluded from the maps you create. You can also have some of the players' gear stolen. This will very likely make them follow where you want them to go.

, Not only will this make the game more decisive, it will make it more fun. No one wants to be playing when the dungeon master is saying ""ummm...well...you know… you just...found a cave, yeah. And in the cave...is...ummm...an imp. Ummm...what do you do?"" Instead, say ""You enter the cave and its dampness overcomes your senses.” You hear a *Imitate the sound of how you imagine an imp in the distance would sound like*. If the player hesitates make the imp attack. If the cave is empty, don’t outright state it. Instead say “You see nothing.”


You will want to become such a good game master that the players are not munchkins but actually want to roleplay. The more you prepare, the easier it will be to give the players this confidence.
Remember that until you say it exists, no one knows what is on that piece of paper behind your screen. Whether you read it directly or change details as you go along, unless you tell the players that they will think it was meant to be that way all along. Use this to your advantage.
Consider who you are playing with. If you are given the opportunity to play with others you should seize it. Also, despite your most careful preparations things will rarely go as planned. Since you are dealing with people, expect there to be conversation outside of the Role-Playing world, and accommodate accordingly. If the game is not going to the preconceived plan you have created, try to incorporate your original ideas in new ways to the current player predicament.
Proper|y involve the players. Never fulfill their wishes directly. Their characters should be designed according to the rule book. They should be given goals which you can intertwine with the story you designed. Keep in mind who the player characters are. For examples, have your non-friendly NPCs address the player with the highest charisma.
The point of going on an adventure is to see and experience new things. Be creative with your descriptions and scenarios to give every location and interaction its own flavor. Don't just drone on about the surroundings; change your voice to show you actually care. Taking on accents of various NPCs also adds a bit of flavor to your dungeon.
Include a world map. You may want to have figures and grid maps to make the combat easy to follow. You may even have pre-designed dungeon halls. If you are terrible at drawing there are ways to improve your fine motor skills.
Don't let your creativity run amok, however. You would like to create a consistency within your game world. While you may be pretending to be in a fantasy world where magic is common, its pervasiveness should be consistent. Keeping your work within this guideline can mean the difference between an engaging fantasy story and a parody where everything seems hokey and dumb.
There are expansion books designed for creating scenarios taking place in another franchise such as The Lord of The Rings. If your scenario takes place in such a well-known franchise, don’t include the main characters from there. Instead make up your own. If someone lectures you about the universe, point out that it's your interpretation of it that matters.

Set up the chess board.",How to Make Chess Pieces," In chess, the pawns represent your infantry. Pawns are the weakest piece on the board, valued at only one point per piece.There are 16 pawns for every full chess set, 8 for white and 8 for black, and are arranged across the second row from either side of the board. To make these you'll need:


16 1"" long carriage bolts (threaded)
16 hex nuts
16 flat washers
All parts should be ¼"" diameter;
, There are four rooks, sometimes called castles, in every chess set, two per color. Rooks are valued at five points apiece, and each rook begins with one in each of the four corners of the chess board.To construct your rooks, you’ll need the following materials:


4 1½"" machine bolts
4 castle nuts
4 flat washers
The threading for these bolts should only extend halfway up the bolt.
Some stores may refer to these bolts as “hex-head cap screws.”, There are four knights on a chess board, two per color, and they occupy the position directly next to each rook on the same row as the rooks. These pieces are valued at three points in chess.To make your knights you’ll need:


4 1½"" long machine bolts (threaded)
4 hex nuts
4 wing nuts
4 flat washers, There are four bishops on a chess board, two per color, and their beginning position is beside the knights on the same row as the knights. Bishops are valued at three points, giving them a tied value with knights.To make your bishops you’ll need the following materials:


4 2"" long machine bolts (threaded)
4 hex nuts
4 cap nuts
8 flat washers
A cap nut is a hex nut, except the head of the nut is rounded. Sometimes it is called an acorn nut., The queen is the most powerful piece on the board, rated at nine points. Each color only has one queen apiece. The queen always begins the game on her own color square next to the bishop, white queens a white square and vice versa for black.To make your queens, you’ll need:


2 2½"" long machine bolts (threaded)
2 cap nuts
4 hex nuts
4 flat washers
2 fender washers
A fender washer is an oversized flat washer., The king is the most important piece in a chess set, so it isn't assigned a value. In order to end a chess game, you'll have to trap your opponent's king in threat. The king begins the game between the bishop and queen. Each chess set has one king per color. To make yours, you’ll need:


2 2½"" long machine bolts (threaded)
2 castle nuts
2 hex nuts
2 fender washers
2 flat washers, Take your hex nuts and screw them onto your bolts so the nuts are even with the end of the bolts. Then, use some glue to attach a washer to each bolt head to give each pawn a base.Chess pawns are usually the smallest pieces on the board, with a wide base, a slim middle, and a round head.

, Thread your castle nuts onto your 1½"" machine bolts so that the bolts extend a ¼"" beyond the nuts. Then, one at a time, use your glue to attach the bolt heads to your washers to create the rooks' base.You may have to hold the bolt head and washer together for a few minutes while the glue sets, otherwise the parts may come loose.
Rooks are sturdy pieces in a normal chess set, with a wide base and a shape that resembles a tower or castle turret.

, Take your hex nuts and thread them onto your 1½"" machine bolts so the nuts are at the halfway point of the threading. Now you can screw your wing nuts onto the bolts until each nut is even with the end of the bolt. Then:


Dab a little glue to the threading just below the wing nut, and then screw your hex nut back toward the end of the bolt until it is even with the wing nut.
Then, glue your washers to the head of the bolt to make the base.
Knights traditionally look like a horse's head and neck with a wide base., Thread your hex nuts onto the 2"" machine bolts so the nuts are ¾ of the way to the head of the bolt. Slip your washer onto the bolt so it rests against the bolt and twist your cap nut onto the bolt's end. Dab glue along the bottom of the cap nuts and then slide the washers up the bolt to glue it against the cap nuts. Then:


Apply glue to the threading below the washers and screw your hex nuts so they're even against the washer.
Complete the piece by gluing washers to the bolt head for the base.
When gluing, you may need to allow some time for the glue to set.
Typical chess sets have bishops with a wide base, a slim center, and oblong head with a slash through it.
Your bishop will end up looking similar to your pawn, but a little bigger and with a few more parts., Twist one hex nut onto each of your 2½"" bolts until the nuts are as close to the bolt head as you can manage. Apply glue to the top of the nuts and slip a washer onto each bolt to glue the washer to the nut. Screw a second hex nut ¼"" above the first on each bolt and glue a second washer to this nut. Then:


Attach a cap nut to each bolt end, glue the threading below the cap nuts, and twist the closest hex nut/washer so it's flat against the cap nut.
Apply glue to the threading below the glued hex nut/washer, then screw the free hex nut/washer so it's flat against the first.
Finally, glue the fender washer to the bolt head to complete the base.
In store bought chess sets, the queen is one of the tallest pieces. She has a wide base, a long, slim center, and a crown on top., Thread a hex nuts onto your 2½"" bolts until they are as close to the head as possible. Put glue onto the nuts and slide washers onto the bolt to glue the washers to the nuts. Then:


Use some more glue to attach one washer to each castle nut, but be careful to keep the threading unobstructed so you can attach the nut.
Screw on one castle nut/washer onto each bolt so the end of the bolt is even with the nut. Then glue a fender washer to each bolt head to finish the base.
The king is usually similar to the queen in height, but with a thicker middle and a larger crown., Allow all of the chess pieces to dry overnight. This will give the glue a chance to completely harden. When the glue is dry, separate the pieces into two opposing sides. Each side should contain one king, one queen, two bishops, four knights, two rooks, and eight pawns.


Once the pieces are divided, check each individual piece for tightness.
If a piece seems loose, you can add some more glue to secure it.

, When the glue touch ups have dried, use a clean, soft cloth to wipe away any oil or dirt that may have accumulated while working on your chess pieces. Then paint half the pieces black and half white.


You may find it easiest to leave your white pieces unpainted, painting only your black pieces.
Spray paint works well for painting your chess set. For best results, you may want to choose a spray paint intended for metal.
If you want to make a chess set that is less traditional, choose two different contrasting colors., After the pieces have had a chance to dry, take out a chessboard and set them up. On the first and last row, arrange your pieces so the corners contain rooks. Moving inwards on the same row as the rooks:


Next to the rooks will be the knights.
Next to the knights go the bishops.
Next to the bishops are your king and queen, with the queen on the same color square as her color (white queen, white square; black queen, black square).
Your pawns from a single row in front of your rooks, knights, bishops, king, and queen.
White's leftmost rook (from white's perspective), should be a black square. On labeled boards, this will be square A1."
"

Play black.,

g4 e5







White begins by moving the pawn on g2 up two spaces to g4.,

f3 Qh4







White moves the pawn on f2 up one space into f3, leaving one side of the king open for checkmate.,

Checkmate!",How to Perform a Fool's Mate in Chess," In the rules of chess, white will always go first. If you were to be the one who goes first, this will take yet another move, or possibly four or five.
, This will help open a path later in these directions.






You counter by moving the pawn on e7 also two spaces up to e5. This creates a diagonal path towards the side of the board.

,, Try developing by giving threat to your opponent so that his/her move is wasted while defending. Meanwhile, you can develop your own piece in your next move.


Keep an eye on controlling the center with your pieces. The center is the place where most of the action will be.
Develop with gain of time by attacking your opponents unguarded pieces and pawns.

, For example, a bishop is bad if it is trapped by pawns of the same color as the bishop. If your center pawns are on white squares and your bishop is trapped behind them, try to exchange the bishop for a well-placed piece of your opponent's.

, You might beat beginners with early mates, but not masters. So develop, rather than attempting premature attacks.


Don't go pawn hunting in the opening (unless it is a center pawn) because it wastes time and will probably put you in an underdeveloped position that is very hard to defend.

Don't move the same piece twice in the first 7 moves because this wastes time.,
Make sure that your pieces are ""developed."",
Attack your opponents pieces with gain of time.,
Have a plan.,
Use the acrostic ""SPACE"" to help look for a plan.,
Look for weaknesses in your opponent's position, then look for ways to exploit those weaknesses.,
Remember that every game is different.",How to Improve the Position of Your Pieces in a Chess Game," If the piece is in danger of being captured, this is a waste of a turn or loss of tempo. If this is the case, you shouldn't have even done that move in the first place.;
, Remember that when we are talking about pieces in this context we are not talking about pawns. Pawns are more like the terrain you fight on, not the pieces you fight with. Make sure your pieces are not sitting on the back rank like wallflowers at a dance. Get them out there, first the knights and bishops, then what they call the ""heavy pieces,"" meaning the queen and the rooks. It's easy to find squares for the knights, they are quite nicely placed on toward the center on the first square they can legally move to, ""f3""and ""c3"" as white and ""f6""and ""c6"" for black. (see How to Read a Chess Game if you don't know what ""f3"" and ""f6"" refers to.)


Make sure you do develop your center pawns though, because these guys help you control the center, and they also allow you to develop your bishops. Try not to allow your opponent to kick your knights off their squares by pawn pushes. Place your bishops where they can control strong diagonals like ""c4"" for white and ""c5"" for black. Make sure you castle, so your king is safe and your rooks are lined up. Rooks like to be connected. Try not to place other pieces between them.

, As you are developing your pieces always look for captures, look for tactics like skewers, forks and pins. But after that, if you don't find something, what to do? This is where a plan comes in. Of course you want to improve the position of your pieces.


Make sure Bishops have open diagonals, try not to block them in with your own pawns. Look to trade your weak pieces for your opponents strong ones. An example would be to trade a bishop that is on the same color as your center pawns for a knight that has an outpost. An outpost is a square far into enemy territory that cannot be kicked out by a pawn, and that is protected by one of his own pawns.
Look for open files on which to place your rooks. Double them if you can. Try to get a rook firmly posted on your opponent's second rank. In White's case this would be the 2nd rank, in Black's the 7th. When your pieces are well place then more opportunities for tactics will appear.

, A plan can be as simple as trying to place your knight on an outpost near your enemy's king. Or to double your rooks on an open file. Once that plan is accomplished you look for another plan that fits well with your goal. Let's say your plan was to have a strong bishop on an open diagonal not blocked in by its own pawns. Then once you have that, you might try to get your queen to a square where your bishop and queen can cooperate to threaten mate.


When your opponent blocks the mate with a piece, say a knight posted on ""f6"" to guard the capturing square on ""h7"" then your new goal can be to dislodge the knight. You might even look for sacrifices. The rook is worth more than the knight, generally, but you might threaten to sacrifice it for the knight so that you can remove th knight from guarding the square where you can checkmate. Sometimes you might be castled on opposite sides.
Then a good plan is to ""pawn storm"" your enemy king. Pawn storming is when you march your pawns toward the enemy king to create weaknesses, and open up files for your rooks and queen. Make sure you have rooks and a queen behind your marching pawns so you don't just give up pawns for no reason. These are all examples of plans, but you have to come up with your own plans to fit your unique position on the chess board.

,


S stands for ""Space"" advantage. If so, move your attack from one side of the board to the other and your opponent will not be able to do so to defend.
P Stands for ""Pawn Structure"". Analyze the pawn structure? Which pawns are weak and could be targets? Does it merit an attack? Are there holes? Simplification? A break-through? An Advance?
A Stands for ""Attack on King"". Do you have development and control of the center enough to merit a king side attack? Should you sacrifice a piece or pawns to break through?
C Stands for ""Combinations"". Is there a combination? What did your opponent to last?
E Stands for ""Endgame"". Are you ahead in material? If so, exchange pieces to simplify and go for a pawn endgame. If you are behind in material, exchange pawns and go for a draw.

, An example of a weakness is a ""backward Pawn"" or a pawn that cannot be defended by another pawn. Start ganging up on that pawn and force your opponent to defend it. This ties his pieces down and he might even lose it, if you can get more pieces to attack than he can to defend. Look for an exposed king or a king that can't or hasn't castled. Try to stop your opponent from castling. A weakened king means you want to look for ways to checkmate. Start ganging up on the king and put him on the defensive. Keep up the pressure till he cracks. Chess is a ruthless game.

, Each position is unique. There are no general formulas for chess, you really have to think for yourself and apply basic principles and understanding to your individual situation. That's what's so great about chess. That's why we recommend it for children, so that they will learn how to think and plan on their own, and not just follow in lockstep to their leaders. In chess there is opportunity for creativity. Do not be afraid to try things in your plan just because you haven't seen or heard of it before. Above all, don't be afraid to lose a few games, that's how you get better!

Make use of the space you have.",How to Fool Your Opponent in Chess," Intentionally leave one of your pieces unprotected, or at least make it appear unprotected, to trick your opponent into making a rash move. Baiting is the one of the most basic strategies in chess, but also one of the most consistently successful. The ""Legal Trap,"" for instance, involves sacrificing one's queen in order to place the opponent's king in checkmate with minor pieces. Many of the most complex strategies and sequences in chess are sophisticated forms of baiting.Make sure you’ve played out every possible follow up move in your head before putting one of your pieces at risk.;
, Even if your opponent has more pieces on the board, you can neutralize their advantage by getting your strongest pieces into clear, well-guarded positions. A good example of this type of placement is to set up one of your rooks at the ""7th rank"" (one row before the end of your opponent's side of the board). From there, the rook is able to keep the enemy king from escaping, all while picking off your opponent's minor pieces and being free to advance or retreat as needed.The ""Blockade"" is another fundamental defensive play that relies on cunning placement rather than capture or evasion. Setting up a blockade is as simple as blocking the path of your opponent's pieces so that they can't advance. While the opponent struggles to get around the blockade without losing valuable pieces, you can use your dominant position to lure them into danger, or escape danger yourself.Superior positioning can discourage your opponent from following through with their plans and force them to play the game you set for them. If you’re careful and don’t leave any obvious openings, you may psyche your opponent out and put them on the defensive.Controlling the board is often preferable to simply having more pieces.

, It’s not enough to simply move one piece, with no thought to the consequences it could have multiple turns down the line. Winning strategies require forethought, and are often devised half a dozen moves or more in advance. Do your best to predict how your opponent will logically respond to the moves you make, and adjust your tactics accordingly. Look over the options they have as well as your own.Try to ""X-Ray"" the board. X-Raying refers to a skilled chess player's ability to see where his or her pieces may be in a good position to attack or defend along a continued plane of movement, beyond the most immediate openings. Learning to X-Ray the board can help teach you to be more forward thinking with your moves.Take as much time as you need each turn to decide on a move that will have the most beneficial outcome. Never move a piece without first having an attack or escape plan ready.

, In order to determine your best course of action, you’ll often have to look at the playing field as a whole, rather than just the squares around the piece you intend to play. A broader perspective will let you spot hazards and openings you might otherwise have missed. Pay particular attention to the position of you and your opponent’s king and queen pieces, as well as pieces they seem to be moving with clear purpose. If you’re being judicious and weighing your options, you’ll be able to thwart your opponent’s plans while carrying out your own.It can help to be able to identify whether a game is ""open"" or ""closed."" When a game is open, it means that many of the crucial squares near the center of the board are unoccupied, whereas these spaces reach gridlock in a closed game. Certain pieces, such as the bishop and queen, will have an advantage in open games where they have more room to maneuver. In closed games, pieces like the knight and pawn shine, as they can capture in close range and move around and in between stationary pieces.Chess operates on the principle of action and reaction. Analyze your opponent’s movements closely. Ask yourself what you would do if you were in their position.

, Don’t get in a rush to win. This is especially critical during the final stages of the game, where you will be eager to score a checkmate but may be overlooking critical mistakes. When played seriously, chess should take a while. You should be prepared to survey the board, take inventory of your pieces and form a new plan of action every time your turn comes up. Sometimes, the winner will be the player that can think ahead and outlast the other.Don’t move pieces around haphazardly whenever it’s your turn. Think over your options at length and only move when you’ve decided on the best strategy.
If you’re preparing to make a move as soon as your opponent sets a piece down, you’re not giving yourself enough time to assess the current situation, and it could cost you the game.A single game of chess can sometimes take days, months, or even years to complete.

, Some pieces can move further or in more directions than others. These should be the ones that do most of the legwork on the board. The rook, for instance, can traverse an unlimited number of squares either forward, backward or to either side in a single move; the bishop can do the same in a diagonal direction. Knights can move across two spaces and up one, allowing them to navigate out of tricky situations and capture pieces in surprise attacks. The more movement options you have, the better able you’ll be to pull off the strategy you’ve laid out.Train yourself to think of playing pieces in tandem with one another. Use your turns to set them up, then make it so your opponent has no way out.
Remember that while some pieces have abilities that others don’t, they are each useful under different circumstances. Not every piece is meant to be played the same way.

, Position pawns around pieces that you can’t afford to lose to keep them from being taken. One of the advantages of pawns is that they have strength in numbers, making them ideal for defensive blocking. When enemy pieces approach, you can either capture them with your pawns or hold your position until your opponent makes a mistake, then follow up by mobilizing powerful pieces.This is why it’s not a good idea to recklessly sacrifice your pawns. Inexperienced players too frequently sacrifice pawns, leaving their important pieces less protected.
Pawns are also capable of being promoted to rook, bishop, knight or even queen pieces when they reach the opposite side of the board., As soon as the game starts, jockey your pawns to take as many of the four center pieces of the board as you can. You can then begin to move your other pieces in the center as the game progresses. The center position of the board is key to controlling the game, as it allows the most mobility, especially for versatile pieces like the knight and queen.Controlling the center gives you more freedom of movement, but it also puts you at more risk of being surrounded by a veteran player.

, Never make any movement without first considering whether it endangers your king. The game is over when either you or your opponent's king is cornered and can no longer escape. For this reason, the royal pieces, the king and queen, are without question the two most important in chess (the queen is the most mobile as well as the most evasive, and forcing the king into a checkmate is the key to winning the game). Use carefully considered positioning and offensive moves to defend the king while deftly whittling away your opponent’s pieces.While the queen is the most versatile (and therefore the most powerful) piece on the board, losing your queen puts you at a terrible disadvantage unless you manage to promote a pawn to new queen piece. Be cautious with your queen and do whatever you can to keep her on the board as you enter the endgame (the final stages of the game when the kings come into play).
One basic defense strategy is to “castle” your king by moving it over two squares and “jumping” it with a rook that’s in the same rank, so that the rook is placed beside the king. This gets the king out of harm’s way while putting the rook in position to intercept an opponent’s threat., Study the board itself and get an understanding of how the playing field is configured. There are 64 squares on a chessboard: exactly twice as many as there are pieces. These squares are arranged in columns (known as “files”) and rows (known as “ranks”) of alternating dark and light colors. Getting used to the layout of the chessboard will improve your spatial awareness and allow you to better capitalize on openings.Most beginners and casual players take the chess board for granted—they see a jumble of squares and pieces and aren’t able to look past the chaos to the significance behind each point of positioning. For this reason, the casual player is never able to develop a winning strategy.
The chessboard can feel pretty cramped in the early going if you don’t know how to properly mobilize your pieces.

, Chess is played using 32 game pieces—on each side there are 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, a king and a queen. Each piece type has a unique pattern of direction that it must follow to move and capture other pieces. Be aware of what these patterns are, and how they are best employed in different parts of the board. Using your pieces in the areas where they’re most effective will keep the game in your favor.You might already have a passing knowledge of how chess is played, but unless you’ve learned the capabilities and limitations of each piece like the back of your hand, your game will be lacking.
There are no “good” or “bad” pieces in chess. Each piece serves a unique function and has advantages that the other pieces don’t have., Once you know how to move each piece, you can begin formulating a game plan using the space you have on the board. No two games will proceed in exactly the same way, so the pieces will always be arranged differently. Look for clear paths to move your pieces along that will put them closer to your opponent’s vulnerable pieces or get them out of harm’s way. Movements should be made decisively, with a clear motive in mind, rather than at random.Lure your opponent into sections of the board where you can outmaneuver them with pieces in key spaces.
Don’t be afraid to sacrifice a piece if it’s absolutely necessary to protect your king or lend you a significant advantage."

Four at 1""
Eight at 2""
Twelve at 3""
Sixteen at 4""
Twelve at 5""
Eight at 6""
Four at 7""

, You'll need to glue the dowels together in a symmetrical pattern that compliments the pieces. You can of course glue them together however you want, but this pattern is recommended (makes one side, mirror to get the whole board):, Clamp the dowels together with a frame clamp if you can get one. If not, do the best you can to secure them together tightly with rope. Let the glue set thoroughly before continuing.

, Once the form is dry, sand the outside until the sides of the dowels are completely flush with each other.

, Use spray paint to paint the entire board to to a single color.

, You will want to make the tops of the squares different colors so that you can more easily see what's happening on the board. Don't feel limited to black and white! You can carefully paint the squares, or you can cut out carefully measured squares of self-adhesive vinyl.

Learn about tactics.,
Develop your knowledge of strategies.,
Execute endgame situations.,
Practice often.,
Get an FIDE membership.,
Score 3 norms at FIDE tournaments.,
Reach a 2500 FIDE rating.",How to Become a Grandmaster," Tactics refer to move sequences that are designed to achieve specific advantage and capture or defend pieces. Tactics are different than strategy in that the latter refers to longer-term piece development with an endgame in mind. Learn how to identify opportunities to utilize tactics and how to execute them.


Forks, also known as double attacks, involve positioning a piece so that two different opposing pieces are under attack at once and unable to counter-attack your piece. Any piece can fork but the knight is particularly useful for forking because it is the only piece that can attack while wedged between horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lanes.Discovered attacks involve using one offensive piece to cover another. For example, if a queen has a diagonal line on a rook but is covered by your knight, you can move the knight out of the way and create an attack opportunity for your queen. Your opponent may not pay attention to a covered piece and thus put their key pieces at risk. Pinning involves placing one piece on a line of attack against the king with another opposing piece in the way. The opposing piece cannot move without exposing the king and must be sacrificed. For example, by placing a bishop diagonal to a king with a knight in the way, your opponent will be forced to sacrifice the knight.;
, Once you reach advanced-level play, you will need to start each match with a core strategy in mind. Core strategies concern general attempts to control portions of the board that will set you up for effective endgame tactics later on. You should also learn about more specific strategies like the Nimzo Defense and the Sicilian Defense which will provide more precise directions for how to move early on in the match. Even if you don’t use these precise strategies, you should learn about them so you can recognize their use by your opponents.Spacing strategies refer to attempts to obtain the largest amount of board coverage to limit your opponents maneuvering options. Spacing is not about pushing individual pieces as far forward as possible but about slowly moving several offensive pieces into your opponent’s territory advancing pawns for defense and support.A lot of core strategies focus on controlling the center. The center refers to the four spaces in the middle of the board (D4, E4, D5, and E5). Specifically, these strategies focus on moving pawns toward the center spaces with offensive pieces supporting them.If you find yourself in a defensive position, exchange pieces to open up more space. Exchanging refers to sacrificing and then trading pieces of equal value., The endgame is the final stage of the match when there are very few pieces on the board. Endgame situations are distinct from the strategies you would use early on or in the middle because there is so much more space to move. A strong game-long strategy that gives you an advantage can be undone if you don’t know how to protect yourself from clever endgame flanking maneuvers.


Pawns become particularly important in the endgame stage as they can be promoted by reaching the backline. It’s often advantageous to maintain stalemates with your offensive pieces until you can promote your pawns.While it’s best to reserve your king near the backline during most of the game, as the board opens up, you’ll want to move it closer toward the middle to give it more maneuverability to get out of checks and support other pieces. The king’s ability to move in all 8 directions makes it much more valuable as an offensive piece as board opens up., Practice as often as possible. It’s best to play against other high-level players that understand advanced tactics and strategy so you will be challenged and can see how advanced players will react to your own strategies.

Move your King Pawn forward to e4.,
Capture your opponent's Pawn at f5.,
Move your White Queen to h5 (Qh5).,
Call out checkmate!",How to Checkmate in 3 Moves in Chess1," In both of these methods the key piece for you is your Queen. The Queen is the piece that you are going to use to achieve the checkmate, so your first move should be to open up space for the Queen to move diagonally. Moving the King Pawn forward two spaces to square e4 achieves this (e4).









If you're unfamiliar with algebraic chess notation, check out the wikiHow article to brush up.
As well as freeing your queen, you need your opponent to expose their king. If black then moves their bishop pawn 2 spaces to f5 to tempt white, the checkmate in three moves is on!;
, Now use your Pawn to capture your opponent's advanced Pawn by attacking on the diagonal. Notated, that's e4xf5. Here you are trying to encourage your opponent to move their Knight Pawn forward two spaces to g5, so it is alongside your Pawn.









This isn't a smart move from your opponent, but maybe you can lull her into it.
The idea of this move is to make sure nothing can block off your route to your opponent's King after you make your next move.

, Checkmate! Now you can move your Queen on the diagonal to h5 and you have your opponents King pinned. That's game over! You'll notice that if your opponent hadn't moved their Pawn forward two in their last turn they could have blocked off your Queen by putting a pawn in her way by g6.









You really need your opponent to play into your hands to pull off this three-move checkmate.

, Now you can take the King with your Queen on the diagonal and celebrate a very swift victory. If your opponent has fallen into the trap they will likely be a bit annoyed, so don't gloat too much!

Play white.,
e4 - Move your king's pawn forward two squares (E2-E4).

,
Bc4 - Move the king's bishop 3 squares out through the gap, so that it threatens your opponent's king-side bishop's pawn, the one on square F7 (F1-C4).

,
Qh5 - Move the queen diagonally out 4 squares, so that it's also attacking the F7 pawn (D1-H5).,

Alternatively, and this is recommended, block the Queen's attack on F7.",How to Do Scholar's Mate in Chess,";
,,,


At this point, someone who has seen Scholar's Mate before will know it's coming. See the section below for how black can block the ploy at this point.

,


You can take the F7 pawn using your bishop instead of the queen, but this won't result in checkmate.

,,,, Some examples given are moving the knight G8-H6, or the queen D8-E7 or the queen's bishop C8-E6.

, If the Queen is on F3, use F7-F6 or G8-F6. If the Queen is on H5, however, do not use G7-G6, unless you have a piece on E7 or E6 (in front of the King). Otherwise, white moves their Queen to E5, forking the Black King and Rook - the check must be dealt with, and the white Queen wins the black Rook.

Make sure the board satisfies the requirements for castling.,
Move the king 2 spaces towards the rook.,
Move the rook to the other side of the king.,
Castle only when it works to your advantage.,
Use a castle to free your rook and create offense.,
Wait to castle until your opponent has mounted an offense.,
Always castle when the center is open.,
Use your opponent's pieces as a guide.,
When in doubt, castle kingside.,
Use castling as part of a coordinated offensive strategy.",How to Castle in Chess," To execute a castle, you'll need to look at the positioning of your king and the positioning of your rook. Neither piece can have been moved from its original position, even if the pieces have returned to that space, although if you want to castle with one rook, the other can have moved freely.


All the spaces between the rook and the king need to be free spaces. To castle with the rook to the right of your king, the bishop and the knight on that side need to have moved elsewhere. To castle with the rook to the left of your king, the bishop, knight, and queen must have moved elsewhere. Likewise, these spaces cannot be occupied by your opponent's pieces, meaning you can't castle to capture a piece.
The king must not currently be in check and must not be put in check as a result of the castling. If you have been checked previously in the game but are not currently in check, you are allowed to castle. If the rook is threatened, you're still permitted to castle.;
, The move itself depends on which rook you choose to castle with. You can castle with either of your rooks, to kingside (to the right of the king, a shorter distance) or to queenside (to the left of the king, in which the rook will move one extra space).



To castle kingside, move your king two spaces right, toward the rook on that side, replacing the original position of the knight, which must be elsewhere.

To castle queenside, move your king two spaces left, toward the rook on that side, replacing the original position of the bishop on that side, which must be elsewhere.

, In the same move, you'll pick up the rook on that side and move it to the space the king moved through to get to its new position. The pieces should be next to one another.



On a kingside castle, the rook will replace the position of the bishop on that side.

On a queenside castle, the rook will replace the position of the queen.

, Novice players who've just learned the rule tend to get overexcited and castle needlessly, when the board allows for it. While it can be a great way to throw off an encroaching attack, or to regroup your pieces for your own forward progress, it's not always the smartest play.


Castling was introduced at some time in the 1500s to increase the speed of play and open up new defensive avenues for players, balancing offensive and defensive strategy into a more fluid style of play., The rook can be one of the most difficult pieces to get into play, often not becoming an important offensive weapon until late in a game. If your offense calls for the wide range of the rook, executing a castle can be an excellent way of freeing the rook from behind the pawns.

, The best time for a castling? Right when your opponent has settled on an offensive strategy that depends on your current positioning. If you see your opponent's offense coming together, you might want to hasten to open up room for a castle, then pull the rug out.


Some players castle early, sometimes within the first five moves, as a way of mounting their offense. If you prefer to orient the pieces having castled, go for it. In general though, you're removing the possibility of a later castle that will throw your opponent off. It's generally used more as a defensive maneuver, rather than an offensive strategy., If you've got your king hanging out there with an open centerboard, it's usually good strategy to move him. It's hard to keep track of everything going on in a chess game as it is, meaning that a wide-open board leaves your king vulnerable and you'd be better defended by castling.


Alternatively, consider leaving your king in place if the action is mostly to the side. An unusual occurrence, perhaps, but it can happen. Play cautiously and read the board always before deciding to castle.

, If you're wondering which side, if any, to castle on, let your opponent's pieces give you the clue. Typically, players want to control the middle of the board, but if you're playing against a more idiosyncratic player, they might have overloaded one side with pieces, making you more vulnerable to an attack on that side, making a castle inappropriate. Instead, work the middle of the board to regain control of the most options for an offensive strike.


Never castle into an attack. Usually your best bet is to castle on the opposite side, taking special care to defend against the pawns as they swarm in. So, if your opponent has overloaded your kingside, castle to the queen., Many players, beginner and expert alike, agree that castling on the kingside offers you the benefit of a protected king and a free rook. It's usually quicker to castle to the kingside, since your queen need not have moved. Keep your pawns structured defensively on the kingside in anticipation of a castling.

Move your King Pawn to d3.,
Move your Queen Pawn forward to e4.,
Move the White Queen to h5 (Qh5).",How to Checkmate in 3 Moves in Chess2," This is a very similar method to the previous one. You are basically aiming to get your opponent's Bishop and Knight Pawns forward one and two squares respectively, while freeing your Queen to enable it to move onto h5. The end result is the same as the previous method.









You are trying to tempt your opponent to move her Bishop and Knight Pawns.
You need you opponent to respond by bringing out her Bishop Pawn one square to f6.
It can also work if she moves her Knight Pawn forward two squares on this turn, as long as she moves the Bishop Pawn on her next move.

, The next move for you to make has to free up your Queen so it can get into a checkmate position on the next move. To do this, move the White King Pawn ahead two squares to e4. Now you have opened up an avenue for your Queen to reach h5.









In order to clear the way to your opponent's King you need her to move her Knight Pawn ahead two spaces to g5.

, Checkmate! And that's it, you have trapped your opponent's King in the same position as the previous method, but this time you did it without even capturing a single piece. Game. Set. Match. Over.








Again, this looks simple and it is. So don't expect it to work very often!
In theory, there are loads of variations on this. The key moves are getting your Queen to h5, and your opponent's Bishop and Knight Pawns out of the way of her King.

Make sure your own pieces are on squares of a color opposite of the square your opponent's bishop is on, if your opponent has only one.

,
Get your king next to pawns, preferably near your opponent's side of the board, so you can block checks by rooks and queens, which cost you moves, and protect your own pawns.

,
Use your king aggressively, especially if you don't have a queen.,

Check your opponent's king constantly if you think you're opponent's trying to trick you into a stalemate.",How to End a Chess Game," When people do not do this, they make stupid mistakes.;
, The extra pieces may be two bishops (hard), one rook (sort of hard), a queen (somewhat easy), or two rooks (very easy). A knight and a bishop checkmate, while possible, takes at least 30 moves by professionals.

, Knowing how to do them quickly and easily will save you the frustration of figuring it out when put on the spot.

, Checkmate is likely if your king is at the edges of the board and even more so in the corners.

, This will prevent the piece from being taken by the enemy's king.

,,, The king can be used to block your opponent's king from moving to certain squares.

, The less pieces your opponent has, the more simple the endgame will be.

, This is a great way to get rid of extra pieces that may interfere with your checkmating procedure.

Orient the points of view of the players.,
Assign names to the columns.,
Note the derived column names.,
Number the rows.,
Note the difference between moves and captures.",How to Annotate Chess1," The players sit opposite each other. The chess board must be turned so that each player has a white square on the right end of that player's first row. Each player will come up with different square designations, expressed from the point of view of that player.;
, Columns are named for the piece that begins the game on the first row in that column. Types of pieces that appear on both sides of the central king and queen pairing have their columns named not only by the piece, but also by the side of the king and queen pairing where the piece started the game.

, Assume the white player view. For white reading left to right, the columns are QR (queen's rook), QK (queen's knight), QB (queen's bishop), Q (queen), K (king), KB (king's bishop), KN (king's knight) and KR (king's rook.) As the white and black king rook pairings are reversed from each other, the same column names would have been derived if the black point of view had been taken.

, Assign numbers from 1 to 8 for the rows starting at the row nearest the player. Note that unlike the columns, this gives white and black different row numbers. When a move is annotated, the row number used is always the row from the view of the moving player.


Examine the system that has been created. Starting at the square at the left of the white player, the square that is 5 rows up in column 3 should read QB5 for the white player and QB4 for the black player.

, A clear move is annotated with the piece making the move, such as a bishop, a dash and the destination square. If an opposing piece, such as a rook, is taken on the final square, an x instead of a dash is used and the taken piece rather than the destination square would be noted. Therefore the move might be noted B-QB4 (clear move) or BXR (capture.)

The book ""1001 brilliant ways to checkmate"" by Fred Reinfeld helps to see checkmates and will help you to calculate basic variations. The book starts out easy with queen sacrifices and then has harder checkmates later.

, Start by learning forks, skewers, pins, discovered attacks and double attacks. Learn how to set up these combinations by finding vulnerable pieces to attack or by taking away the defender.


The book ""1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations"" by Fred Reinfeld helps to train basic combinations and calculation.

, Your opening moves set the stage for the rest of your game. Pay close attention to development, time, central control, space, pawn structure and king safety.

, Be careful about entombing pieces that require open space. Developing these pieces allows them to succeed in any position.

, It is recommended that the pawns in front of your king and queen be moved two squares before any other pawns, provided your opponent does not do it first.

,,,, This wastes time and loosens the castled king position. This also invites your opponent to attack.

,,, Move the bishop first.

,,,,,,,,,, Endgames enable you to understand how the pieces work individually. They also improve your calculating abilities, as many times endgames can be won out of pure calculating power. Everything you pick up by studying endgames can be applied to middle-games and even openings; you could, for instance, judge if a certain exchange is good for you by analyzing what kind of endgame could arise from that position.


Basic endgame strategy is that you must ahead in material by at least a rook to mate. The exception to this rule is that two knights and a king cannot force mate on a lone king.
If you are ahead in material exchange pieces not pawns.
If you are behind in material, exchange pawns not pieces and go for the draw. If your opponent is left with a knight or bishop advantage and there are no pawns, he cannot force mate.

, Play as much as possible, even if you have to play yourself. Be sure to apply what you have learned.

, This allows you to go back over your games to study your mistakes and missed opportunities. If possible, store an archive of your games in "".pgn"" format with attached notes. Tournament games are especially good because you are likely to face skilled opponents who are willing to analyse the game together with you in the ""post-mortem"".

, Many grandmasters and masters over the past couple hundred years have pumped decades of their lives into researching the game. You can learn a few things from their games. If possible go over the record making your own notes. Then compare that with what others have written.

, The chess organizations that run chess tournaments (i.e. the World Chess Federation) rate players based on their performance. This rating is a very clear indication of a players abilities in tournament settings. The rating system is broken into class ratings (J-A) and titles (expert, master, international master, grandmaster). Getting involved in tournament play is a necessary step if one wishes to compare his or her chess strengths with the chess community at large.

Define the moving piece.,
Shorten the destination description.,
Declare capture of opposing pieces.,
Annotate a castling.",How to Annotate Chess2," Always indicate the moving piece, rather than the originating square. Even if there are 2 bishops on the board, it will be obvious that only 1 of them could legally move to the destination square indicated.

, The move B-QB4 should more effectively be described as B-B4 because it is obviously impossible for that bishop to move to KB4.

, Always indicate the piece being captured, rather than the destination square. It is common for a piece to be threatened from 2 sources. The opening declaration of the annotation will define the piece performing the capture.

, Castling is a special move that allows both the king and a rook to move on the same turn in a specific pattern. As this pattern requires the king to move 2 squares, and is the only time the king is allowed to move 2 squares, annotate a castling by annotating the king move. The rook move will be assumed.

An example of a book would be having all four queens in a deck: the queen of hearts, the queen of spades, the queen of clubs, and the queen of diamonds.
A book doesn't have to be composed of face cards. You could have a book of nines: the nine of hearts, the nine of spades, the nine of clubs, and the nine of diamonds.;
, Players collect complete books by taking turns asking each other for a card they need to make a set of cards complete. For example, if a player is dealt a two of clubs and a two of hearts, she will ask another player if he has a two. In this way she adds cards to the book until it is complete.

, If a player is asked for a card she has in her hand, she is obligated to hand over all cards of that rank. If she does not have the card, she replies, ""Go fish."" The player who requested the card then ""fishes"" a card from the pile of extra cards called the ""draw pile."" This gives her an extra chance to obtain a card for one of the books she is building.


If a player receives the card she asked for or draws it from the pile, she gets another turn.
If a player doesn't end up with the card she asked for, her turn is over.

, Players continue to go around the circle, asking for cards, drawing cards and creating books, until either someone has no cards left in his or her hands or the draw pile runs out. The person with the most books is the winner.

The person who had the idea to play the game usually plays the role of the dealer. The other players arrange themselves in a circle extending from both sides of the dealer.


Some people like to follow certain rules to figure out who the dealer should be. For example, the dealer could be the youngest or oldest person present, or the person whose birthday is coming up the soonest.
If you end up playing more than one game of Go Fish, the dealer of the second game is usually the person who won the first game.

, Any time you're about to start a card game, shuffle the deck to redistribute the cards from the last game. This ensures the cards aren't organized in a predictable pattern and shows the other players that no cheating is involved.

, Start with the deck of cards face down, so they cannot be seen by any of the players. Give the topmost card to the first player on the left, the next card to the next player in the circle, and so on. Continue dealing cards one at a time around the table until everyone has five cards.


If you are playing with just two players, deal 7 cards to each player instead of 5.

If you don't have any cards of the same rank, you may choose to pursue any of the cards in your hand.

, This player chooses someone else, it doesn't matter who, to ask whether he or she has a card of a specific rank. For example, the player might say, ""Moirin, do you have any threes?""


If Moirin has threes, she is obligated to hand them over, and the player gets another turn.
If Moirin has no threes, she says ""Go fish."" The player then draws a card from the draw pile. If it's the card he or she asked for, another turn is granted. If not, game play moves to the next person on the left.

, As play moves around the circle, players start collecting enough cards to make complete books. When a book is complete, the player shows the other players the book, then lays the cards in the book face down.


As players ask each other for cards, try to remember which cards they asked for. When it's your turn, you'll have the advantage of knowing what's in their hand. For example, if you hear a player ask someone else for an eight, and you're hoping to collect a book of eights yourself, remember to ask that player for an eight next time it's your turn.

, Eventually the draw pile will dwindle and the cards will run out. When this happens, each player counts his or her books. The person with the most books is the winner.

"
"
Ask for specific cards.,
Play with pairs instead of books.,
Disqualify players who run out of cards.",How to Play Go Fish4," Rather than asking for a card in the same rank, ask for a specific card. For example, if you have a jack of hearts, ask another player for a jack of diamonds, rather than just asking for a jack. This variation makes the game more difficult, and it tends to last longer this way.

, When you form a pair of two cards of the same rank and color, show the other players and lay the pair down. An easier variation would be to form pairs of two cards of the same rank, even if they aren't the same color.

, In a typical game of Go Fish, the game is over when a player runs out of cards. Play a variation in which the game continues among the players who still have cards.

Count each player’s score of deadwood.,
Note that some people play with different scoring systems.,
Play until one player reaches 100 points.",How to Play Gin Rummy," The goal of the game is to collect a hand that is made up entirely of sets and runs. Sets are 3 or 4 cards of the same number (ie. 7 of hearts, 7 of diamonds, 7 of clubs, and 7 of spades). Runs are 3 or more cards in consecutive order and with the same suit (ie. 3 of spades, 4 of spades, 5 of spades).





;
, Face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10 points, Aces are worth 1, and normal number cards are worth the number they represent (ie. a card with a 6 on it is worth 6 points).








Note that aces are always low in Gin Rummy. A-2-3 is a valid run but A-King-Queen is not.

, You will need a standard 52-card deck of playing cards, a pad of paper to keep score on, a pen or pencil, and a friend to play with. Gin Rummy is played between 2 people.









Playing with 3 people: The deal deals to the other two players but does not deal to his/herself. The dealer sits out while the other two players play. The loser of each hand becomes the dealer. The winner and the previous dealer play the next hand.
Playing with 4 people: Pair up into teams of 2. Each player in a team plays a separate game with one of the opposing team members. At the end of the hand, if both players on the same team won, that team scores the total of their points. If one player from each team won, the team with the higher total score scores the difference between the two teams scores. (Playing and Scoring are described in detail below).

, The dealer will deal 10 cards to each player, alternating between players for each card. The players may look at and sort their cards. Set the rest of the cards in a tidy stack in between the two players.








, Place the card face up next to the deck. This card forms the discard pile. The remainder of the deck remains face down on the table to form the stock.








, Begin play by drawing a card either from the top of the deck or from the discard pile and adding it to your hand. This is called The Draw. When you draw from the deck, do not show your opponent your card.







, This is called the Discard. You may not throw away a card that you just drew from the discard pile during the first part of this turn; however, you may throw away a card just drawn from the deck during this turn.







, To knock, throw a card face down on the discard pile and show your remaining cards. You must be able to match almost all of your remaining cards into sets and runs. Any cards you cannot match are called ‘deadwood’. The total score of your deadwood cards must be 10 points or less. A player can knock on any of his








Example of a valid Knock hand: 1 card to discard face down, a set of three 7’s, a run of 3-4-5 in spades, and a 2, a 7, and an ace. In this case, you can lay down your set and run, and your deadwood, when added up, equals 10.

, Players who “go gin” get a special bonus when scoring their points.








An acceptable “going gin” hand would be: 1 card to discard face down, a set of 7’s, a run of 3-4-5 in spades, and a set of 10’s.

, The non-knocker must spread his/her cards face up and create any runs or sets if he/she has the ability to do so.








, If the knocker did not go gin, the non-knocker is allowed to ‘lay off cards’. If the knocker ‘went gin’, the non-knocker cannot lay off cards. After creating any possible runs or sets (refer to the previous step) the non-knocker can lay off his








Example:If the knocker put down a set of 7’s and a run of 3-4-5 in spades, the non-knocker could ‘lay off’ cards by adding a 7 to the set or a 2 or 6 of spades to the run. The non-knocker can extend a run by as many cards as possible (ie. he/she could add a 2, 6, 7 etc. of spades to the run if possible, so long as the numbers in the run remain consecutive).

, If this happens, no score is counted and the same dealer deals the cards again.








, If the knocker goes gin, the knocker scores the non-knocker’s number of deadwood points, plus a 25 point bonus. If the knocker’s score is lower than the non-knocker’s score, the knocker scores the difference between the two totals of deadwood. If the knocker’s score is tied with the non-knocker’s score, or is higher than the non-knocker’s score, the non-knocker scores the difference and gets a bonus of 25 points.








Example of a knocker who went gin: The non-knocker had a total of 21 points of deadwood so the knocker gets 21 points plus the 25 point bonus for a total of 46 points.
Example of a knocker with a lower score: If the knocker had a total of 3 deadwood, and the non-knocker had a total of 12 deadwood, the knocker scores 9.
Example of a knocker and non-knocker with a tied score: If the knocker has a total of 10 deadwood and the non-knocker has 10 deadwood, the non-knocker scores 0 but gets a 25 point bonus.
Example of a knocker with a higher score: If the knocker has 10 deadwood and the non-knocker has 6 deadwood, the non-knocker scores 4 points, plus a 25 point bonus.

, Another common scoring system is: “going gin” earns 20 points, and a non-knocker with a lower deadwood score scores the difference between the two scores and a 10 point bonus.







, The winner gains a 100-point bonus for winning, unless the loser did not score at all, in which case the bonus is 200 points. Both players gain 20 points for each winning hand, totaled at the end of the game, not at the end of each hand. If you are playing for money or tokens, the loser pays the winner the difference between the scores.

Deal 7 cards to each person.,
Hold your cards like a fan.,
Fish for cards.,
Continue taking turns asking the questions until you have no more cards left and count your pairs.",How to Play Go Fish with Any Cards," Use a standard 52-card deck. Deal face-down, so that no player can see the face of the card being dealt to them. As soon as all the cards are dealt, players may pick up and view their own cards (but no one else's). If any player has a pair of the same cards (such as two sevens), he will put it in his pile of pairs. The remaining cards that are not dealt out already will be placed in a pile between the two players.;
, They should face so that you can identify each of your cards, but no one else can. You can also hold all your cards in a stack to reduce the risk of another player seeing your hand.

, Generally, the youngest player will play first, and the game rotates clockwise from there. The player will hold up his cards and say ""Do you have a __ ?"" Ask for a card that will match a single card you already own. If another player has the number or letter on one of his cards, he will give the person who asked for that card and put it in his pile of matches of cards. If nobody has the called card, they will say ""Go fish"", and the player must take a card from the pile in between them. Then the player will ask the same question except they will say a number or letter from their hand of cards.

, The player with the most pairs wins the game. If you play again, the winner of the last game will deal the cards and ask the question first.

,How to Play Egyptian Rat Screw1,
"
Take a regular deck of playing cards (minus the jokers) and shuffle thoroughly.,
Begin the game.,
If the card played has a number on it, the person two spaces to the left of the dealer puts down a card, too.,
When a letter card is played, the next person in the sequence must play another letter card in order for play to continue.,
The only thing that overrides the letter card rule is the slap rule.,
Players should abide by the slap rule in the following situations:



Double: when two cards of equivalent value are laid down consecutively.,
You must add one or two cards to the bottom of the pile if you slap the pile and it was not slap-able.,
Continue playing even if you have run out of cards.",How to Play Egyptian Rat Screw2," Pass out the entire deck to the players, face down. Distribute evenly so everyone has the same amount. Players hold their cards face down and are not allowed to look at them.

, The person left of the dealer goes first by pulling the top card off his/her pile and placing it face-up in the middle. You are not allowed to see your card until it is placed in the middle.

, This continues around the table until somebody puts down a letter card (J, Q, K, or A).

, The number of chances they have to play a letter card is determined by the initial letter; you can play up to 4 cards if an ace has been played, 3 for a king, 2 for a queen, and just 1 for a jack.


If the next person in the sequence does not play a letter card within their allotted chances, the person who played the last letter card wins the round and the whole pile goes to them. Subsequently, the next round begins with this winning person.
Remember, nobody can look at their cards before they're played, so the odds are completely random!

, The first person to slap the pile of cards when the slap rule is put into effect is the winner of that round. If it cannot be determined who was the first to slap the pile, the person with the most fingers on top wins. If the tie cannot be resolved this way, play continues normally.

, Ex: 5, 5

Sandwich: when two cards of equivalent value are are laid down consecutively, but with one card of different value between them. Ex: 5, 7, 5

Top bottom (or bottoms up): when the same card as the first card of the set is laid down. However, this rule is nullified if a card is burned as a penalty (see below).

Tens: when two cards played consecutively (or with a letter card in between) add up to 10. For this rule, an ace counts as one. Ex: 3, 7 or A, K, 9 (sandwich)

Jokers: when jokers are used in the game, which should be determined before gameplay begins. Anytime someone lays down a joker, the pile can be slapped.

Four in a row: when four cards with values in consistent ascending or descending order is placed. Ex: 5, 6, 7, 8 or Q, K, A, 2

Marriage: when a Queen is placed over or under a King (this is considered an optional rule). Ex: Q, K or K,Q

, This is called ""burning cards"" and voids the top bottom slap, since it changes the first card in the set.


If you have no cards and you slap at the wrong time, then you are out of the game for good (unless you are playing by modified rules, such as allowing players to lend cards to each other).

, So long as you don't slap at the wrong time, you are still allowed to ""slap in"" and get cards! Everyone should try to stay in the game until you have a single winner who obtains all the cards.

Treat triples as instant-win scenarios.,
Treat triple 6's as instant-lose scenarios.,
Treat triples as you would normally treat doubles.",How to Play Egyptian Rat Screw3," In this variation, when three cards of the same type are played in a row (777, QQQ, etc.) the first player to slap instantly wins the game, even if they had no cards before slapping!


Note that this is exceedingly rare - for this to happen, the first double has to have gone unnoticed. If anyone slaps the initial double, s/he wins those cards and a triple is no longer possible, even if the next card played is the same type as those in the double.

, For a devilish twist on the standard triples rules, use this optional variation. In this case, when a triple six is played (666), if anyone slaps it, s/he instantly loses, no matter how many cards s/he had. It's extra-tricky to remember to slap any triples except for this one, so be prepared for serious frustration!


As with the normal triples described above, this one also requires the initial double to go un-slapped to be valid.

, If you're not interested in playing Egyptian Rat Screw with the possibility of someone instantly winning or losing through luck, you can simply treat triples as doubles and proceed to play as you normally would, allowing players that slap triples to win the cards in the pile.

Set a rule of silence.",How to Play Jackpot," Jackpot is played with partners on teams of two. It can be played with multiple teams, but the difficulty dramatically increases when you have more than 8 players attempting to play.;
, Before you begin the game, discuss a set of secret signals to use with your partner. The signals should be discreet so they are not deciphered by opposing teams.Signals are used to notify your partner that you have collected four of a kind.
Come up with fake signals as well to trick your opponents.
You can use signals to let your partner know what cards you are trying to collect as well.

, In Jackpot there are different ways to score points. You can score by collecting four of a kind, or you can score by knowing when your opponents have four of a kind.Decide if you and your partner will both try to get four of a kind, or if one partner plays a support role trying to provide the other partner with the right cards.
Determine if you will focus on watching your opponents to score off their hands or if you will only try to score on your own hand.

, Partners should be seated across from each other. If there are more than four people playing the game make sure that partners are not sitting next to each other.

, Players should sit around a table where each person has access to the center of the table.If there is an even number of players, the person who is designated as the dealer can rotate between each player.
When playing with an odd number of players, one person can be selected as the dealer while the other players have a partner to collect four of a kind.

, If you are playing with six or eight players, place six or eight cards respectively in the center. The cards in the center of the table are available for anyone to choose.

, The dealer or a designated starter will say “3, 2, 1, Go!” Each player selects a card from the discard pile to add to his hand.


When a card is selected from the discard pile, the player will discard one card from his hand to only have 4 cards in his hand at any given time.
Take turns going around clockwise.
Each turn, a player must pick up one card and discard one card.

, The goal of the game is to collect four of the same card in your hand. Choose cards that match what you already have in your hand and discard those that you don’t need.


If no players want the cards that are on the table, the dealer can place four more cards in the center to keep the game going.

, Watch your partner for the secret signals you created at the beginning of the game. When your partner gives you the signal, yell “Jackpot!”You earn one point for correctly identifying your partner’s four of a kind.






If you call out “Jackpot” and your partner does not have four of a kind, you lose one point.

, Watch your opponents to see if you can discover their secret signals. If you notice an opponent picking up a card and discarding the same card, they may have collected four of a kind.


Call out your an opposing team player’s name followed by jackpot, “John Jackpot!” If John has four of a kind then you score a point.
If the opposing player does not have four of a kind, you lose a point.

, Once a team has collected four points, they win the game. Longer games can be played by setting a higher point limit.

, Instead of taking individual turns, players can all pick up and discard cards at the same time. This makes it harder to tell when someone has gotten four of a kind in their hand.Try to pay attention to what other players are doing so that you can be aware of their hands as they try to collect four of a kind.

, In full contact jackpot, players can take cards out of other players hands. Set rules regarding whether you can only take the card that was just picked up, or if you are allowed to grab any card out of an opposing players hand.

, Set a point limit for each round; four points per round is a good limit. Play a game of best of 5 or 7 rounds. The first team to reach 3 out of 5 or 4 out of 7 rounds won is the winner of the game.

, If you have an odd number of players you can designate one person to be the dealer.


The dealer can add more cards to the center if no players want to pick up any cards on the table.
The dealer serves as a judge to determine who calls jackpot first in the event of a tie.

, Players must remain silent during game play. Decide on penalties for communication or talking during the game. Without talking, game play becomes more challenging due to each players desire to speak or shout at their opponents.

If you are playing with more than five players, combine two decks of cards.

, If there are three or more players, each player gets five cards. If there are only two players, each player gets seven cards.

Legal cards that can be played on the discard pile are:


If the top card on the discard pile is not an 8, you can play any card that matches the number or suit of the card. For example if the top card in the discard pile is a 7 of hearts, a player could play another 7 or any card that has a suit of hearts, such as a King of hearts or a 2 of hearts., The player who put the 8 down must declare what suit he/she wants to change it to. The next player must either play a card of the declared suit or play another 8. If he/she cannot, he/she follows the usual rules and must draw cards.Strategy tip: If you have an 8 but can play all your cards without using it, hold on to it and play it as your last card, since you can play an 8 down on any other card.

Know that there are many variations of Crazy Eights.,
Switch up the way players are allowed to draw cards.,
Make it harder for a player to put down his/her last card.,
Make the game more difficult by designating rules for other cards.",How to Play Crazy Eights3," Don’t be afraid to add on to the basic rules with your own rules.

, In the basic way to play, a player can draw a card from the stock even if he/she has a card in his/her hand that he/she can play.Make a rule that says if you have a card you can play in your hand, you must play it.
Make a rule that says if you draw a card from the stock that is a legal card, you can play it immediately instead of waiting for your next turn.
Make a rule that says you can only draw a certain number of cards from the stock during each turn. If you still cannot (or will not) play a card that you have drawn, the turn passes to the next player.

, Make a rule that says if a player has only one card left, he/she must alert the other players of that fact. If a player fails to do so, he/she must draw two cards., This makes the game more like UNO. Designate a number or face card to be a ‘skip next player’ card, a ‘reverse order’ card and a ‘draw two’ card.Example: Designate 4s to be a skip card. If you play any 2, the next player’s turn gets skipped. Designate all Queens to be reverse cards. If you play a queen, the order of play is reversed. Designate Kings to be draw-two cards. If you play a king, the next player must draw two cards.

Deal 4 cards in pairs to each player.,
Start with the player to the left of the dealer, players will play their cards going clockwise.,
Count scores.,
Learn advanced rules.",How to Play Casino (Card Game)," Then place four cards on the table, face up.;
, There are many ways to play the cards, such as:


Trailing. When you have no other plays, you simply lay a card on the table.
Pairing. If you have a card of the same rank as one on the table, you may play the card and pair. Take both cards and put them aside in your pile of captured cards. Ex. If there is a 3, 5, K, and 9 on the table, and you have a K, then you may capture the K on the table along with yours.
With a build, you may capture 2 cards on the table. Play the card and take 2 cards on the table that add up to your played card. Ace counts 1, Jack counts 11, Queen counts 12, and King counts 13. Ex. If there is a 2, 9, 5, and Q on the table, and a J in your hand, then you may capture the 2&9 on the table with your Jack.
Leaving a build. If you have a card that adds with a card on the table to another card in your hand, you may leave a build. To do this, you lay the first card on the card on the table and say,""Building...""and whatever number you're building. There is a risk, though, in doing this. Your opponent(s) may steal your build by taking it with the same card. If it gets back to you without being stolen, you may take it. Ex. If there is a 5 and 4 on the table, and a 3 and 7 in your hand, then you may lay the 3 on the 4 and call,""Building 7,"" hoping no other player steals it with a 7.
Redeals. Once everyone is out of cards, the dealer deals the same way as in the beginning of the game, but no cards go to the table.
Final Rule. The last player to capture cards after the last deal takes the remaining cards on the table.

, 3 points goes to the most cards, 1 point to most spades, 2 points for the 10 of diamonds, aka the Big Casino, 1 point for the 2 of spades, aka the Little Casino, and 1 point for each ace. Continue playing until one person reaches 21 points, who is declared the winner.

,


Sweeps. If one player takes all the cards on the table at any time, not including the one at the end of the round, it is a sweep and scores one bonus point.
You may capture more than one combo at once. Ex. You may capture a 8, A, and 9, all with one 9.

Before playing in sit and go tournaments, play in freeroll tournaments.,
Download the PokerStars game, open an online account, make a small deposit and choose a version of poker to play in.,
Calculate, from the online poker sites view, their gains or losses from hosting these tournaments.,
Be patient, tournament poker has bigger ups and downs than ring games but the big positive is that playing with real money is rewarding.",How to Play in Sit and Go Tournaments for Even Money," Freeroll tournaments have no buy-in or cash prizes but the top finishers are awarded tickets to tournaments with cash prizes. Read about freeroll tournaments.;
, Online poker is dominated by PokerStars and the version of poker played most often is no-limit Texas hold 'em. Open an account with PokerStars and learn to play Texas hold 'em. Investigate the offerings of other online poker sites such as Cake Network, Full Tilt, Bodog etc. This article tells you about how to play at PokerStars.


Download the game from PokerStars. There are two types of downloads - the play money and the real money. To play in sit and go you must download and install the real money version. With PokerStars your screen name and avatar will be permanent so choose them carefully.
Deposit money into your account. A minimal deposit of $10 is recommended because if you play in the 10¢ buy-in tournaments you can play in 100 tournaments. Playing in 100 tournaments takes a lot of time and will give you a lot of experience. All this if you do not come in the money for 100 tournaments. With $10 you could play in 500 2¢ buy-in tournaments, but the 2¢ tournaments are not offered frequently.
Learn the rules of no-limit Texas hold 'em because this is the game that is played most often. Learn from playing in play money games, from books, DVDs and online websites.

, The online sites gain(or loss) = the number of players X the buy-in and any other fees minus their prize disbursements.


Two cents buy-in. Requires 990 players with a buy-in of two cents. The total buy-in is $19.80 and this amount if distributed to the top 50 players. The online poker site does not have a gain or loss from hosting their 2¢, 10¢ and 25¢ sit and go tournaments.
Ten cents buy-in. Starts when 360 players register, so 360 X 10¢ = $360 and this is the amount that is distributed to the top 36 finishers.
Do this for the various sit and go tournaments, so you can play in tournaments that have the least disadvantage to you. These are even money tournaments. The bigger buy-in tournaments are not even-money. As a novice poker player, this is the way to learn how to play tournament poker and as a side benefit, you will be able to transfer some of your newly acquired skills, at no-limit hold 'em, to ring games.
After signing on for a sit and go, wait until the tournament starts. When enough players register, the tournament will begin i.e. there is no predetermined starting time. At this writing at PokerStars, there were 11,000 players playing in the 10¢ sit and go tournaments. If you miss part of the tournament, the escalating blinds will quickly diminish your money and you will be eliminated. There is absolutely no chance of winning these tournaments by sitting out of them (not playing), you have to get in there and play.

, Again, your losses, if you are not a winning player, are minimized in sit and go tournaments. Playing in a ring game, on tilt or just having a bad run of cards, it is very easy to lose $10 in a day.

Each person should deal out a stack of 5 cards and put in in the middle to their right.

,
Now, each person places one card face down to the left of the stack of 5.,
Each player then deals themselves a hand of five cards, and sets down the remaining 15 cards.

,
Begin playing.,
As you transfer cards from your hand to the middle piles, replace them by picking up cards from the stack of 15 leftover cards.,
If neither of you can place a card on the pile, take one from the stack of 5 next to each middle pile, flip it over, and keep playing.

,
When you run out of cards to play, slap the smaller pile.,
Keep playing until one player has no cards left.",How to Play Chinese Spit," Take out the jokers. Split the deck in half and and give one half to each person.;
,, There should now be four piles in the middle of the two players. The outside piles should have 5 cards each, and the inside piles should have one. The players should now be holding 20 cards.

,, Flip over the two cards in the middle at the same time, and begin transferring cards from your hand to the top of the middle two cards as fast as you can. You can only place a card on the top of the piles if it has a value one higher or one lower than the card at the top of the pile. For example, if one of the cards in the middle is a 3, you can only place a two or a four on top of it.

, Remember that you can only hold 5 cards at a time.

,, The pile you slap is the pile of cards that you will use for the next round. Take that pile as well as the outside pile next to it, shuffle, and set up the game again. The number of cards in each pile should remain the same except for the stack of leftover cards.

, That player is the winner.

Don't worry about strategy.",How to Play Clock Patience," Any standard set of cards will work for this game, so get a deck at the store or find one around the house. Count out your cards to make sure that you have all 52, otherwise you won't be able to win. Shuffle the deck and get ready to deal. Also consider playing online if you have a computer and an internet connection., Clock Patience requires a little more space than a traditional game of Solitaire. Find a large flat surface like a desk or a tabletop to play on. You can also play clock patience on the floor if you need more space.

, Clock Patience takes its name from the setup: the cards are arranged in 12 piles of four, positioned in a circle. Each of these 12 piles takes the position of a number on a clock: one pile for 12 o'clock, one pile for 1 o'clock, one pile for 2 o'clock, and so on. Deal the cards face down into their 12 piles around the circle until each pile has four cards., Once you deal four cards into their 12 piles, you will have four cards remaining. These become their own 13th stack, placed facedown in the middle of the circle., The middle, or 13th pile has four cards: turn one of them over and place it on top of its stack. Look at the number or face-value of the card. The number or face will determine where the card goes., Starting with the 1 o'clock position, cards belong in the stack associated with their number: Aces go to the 1 o'clock pile, twos go to the 2 o'clock pile, threes go to the 3 o'clock pile, fours go to the 4 o'clock pile, fives go to the 5 o'clock pile, sixes go to the 6 o'clock pile, sevens go to the 7 o'clock pile, eights go to the 8 o'clock pile, nines go to the 9 o'clock pile, tens go to the 10 o'clock pile. For face cards, place the Jacks in the 11 o'clock pile and Queens in the 12 o'clock pile. Kings will be placed in the middle, or 13th pile. When you find the correct pile, slide the card face up, under the stack it belongs in.

, Turn over the top card of the pile you just played into. This becomes your next card in play. Place that card into the pile in which it belongs. For example, a 7 of diamonds would go facedown into the bottom of the 7 o'clock pile. A Queen of spades would go facedown at the bottom of the 12 o'clock pile.

, For each card that you turn over and place in the correct pile, flip over the next card from that pile and play it. Clock patience is a fun game to play quickly, so try to place the cards as quickly as you determine where they belong. Continue playing until there are no cards to flip over., If you flip over and play your last card, then find that all of the cards have successfully been placed into their piles, you win. All four Kings will be in the middle pile, all Jacks will be in the 11 o'clock pile, all sixes will be in the 6 o'clock and so on. Reshuffle your cards and play another hand., If you get to the end of the game and you've exposed all four kings but other cards are still facedown, you lose the game. Clock Patience is entirely a game of chance, so don't be too frustrated. Shuffle your cards well and try again., Unlike other Solitaire variations, strategy doesn't factor into Clock Patience. The order and stacking of the cards is left entirely up to chance, affected only by the order in which they're dealt. In fact, you have a 1 in 13 chance of winning: the exact number of piles that you dealt."
"
Divide the pack into reds and blacks and make sure each color has just one joker.,
Place the two red kings at one end of whatever surface you're playing on(face up, longer sides touching).,
That's the setup, now the game.,
Now to archers.,
Movement.,
Movement Every unit can only go one square(apart from kings who can't move).,
They can go next to the king though.

,
Face cards.,
Playing.,
In order to kill the king you must have one jack or ace with a queen next to him attacking the king.",How to Play Fort of Solitude," Take out all four kings.;
, From the two shorter ends of the two cards count out four card in a line. At the end of the line do the same with the black kings as with other kings. Make sure they line up. Then place the red pile of cards next to the red king and the black cards next to the black king.

, We'll start with basic infantry(number cards). They come in three tiers, 2,3,4...5,6,7...and 8,9,10. Cards 4,7 and 10 are archer(more about them later). At the start you only have access to the first tier. If you pick up cards from other tiers you have to put them in the discard pile. To access the next tier you have to pick up the joker which allows you the next tier. When the cards run out and you use the discard pile you have another chance to get the next tier. Higher cards defeat lower cards but cards of the same value can't attack each other(apart from archers). Melee cards(everything apart from archer) can only attack cards next to them: not diagonally.

, Archers can attack from two squares(see movement) away. They can kill lower ranking units but if the unit is a higher number or a face card they can stop them moving on the next go. They move and can be attacked by melee units exactly the same though. Having a unit between the archer and his target does not matter. Archers can shoot a unit if it is next to them but can't use melee.

, Basically one 'square' is the size of whatever cards you're playing with

, Units can move however far they want to sideways but they can only move forwards and backwards in the space between the two kings.

,, This includes aces. Apart from the queen these cards can't be killed by number cards. They can be stopped by archers though. Kings can kill any cards in the deck. In order to kill the king a jack or an ace must have a queen next to them and be next to king. None of the face cards are archers. Queens are the only none combat unit. Any card that has a queen next to it has to be killed twice to be put on the discard pile.

, Each turn you can do either: place a card. You pick a card each turn from your pile. If you can't use it or there's no space you put on the discard pile. You can move a unit(see moving). You place cards next to the kings but not behind the kings or diagonal to them. If there is nowhere to place a card you must discard it. You can't place cards on top of each other.

, If the king attacks the jack/ace though you must use a different jack/ace because the card will go down to 0ne life(queens give you two lives).

Listen to various radio stations.,
Listen to the radio as much as possible.,
Research multiple winning avenues.,
Listen to the rules and clues carefully.",How to Win Radio Contests1," Not every station offers the same contests or prizes. In order to take full advantage of what radio contests have to offer, you have to listen to a bunch of different stations to see what kind of contests they're running. One station could have a call-in contest happening at 2:00 PM, and there may be another contest happening on a different station at 5:00 PM. Once the first contest is over, switch over to the next one and try again.


The more contests you try to enter, the better your odds are of winning.;
, If you can, listen to the radio at work, at home, in the car, or even the park.This way you can figure out what each stations' pattern is. See which stations offer more opportunities to win, which have better prizes, and what times the contests run during the day. In order to truly maintain a competitive edge, you have to listen to as many stations as possible and get to know them inside and out.


You don't need to have a radio to be able to listen to radio stations. You can pick up stations on iPods, iPads, mp3 players, and your computer.

, Every station has a website and they usually have sweepstakes or contests you can sign up for on their websites where you don’t have to be listening live to win. Go to the website and register for them. This way, you can bypass the time restrictions of live giveaways and save effort. You can also sign up for their mailing lists for upcoming contests.Occasionally, you will get extra clues or times e-mailed to you. Check all the radio stations in your area and see who is giving away what prize; you can switch stations during the day.There are reportedly less contestants who play contests listed on radio station websites which means your chances of winning are higher. , Time yourself accordingly to listen for when the call number or song of the day is announced, helping to avoid missing out at the last moment. If you have to call at 9:01 AM, then call at exactly 9:01 AM. You can use your cell phone, computer, cable box, anything that has the exact time.Usually, if a contest is from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM, they are going to give the signal to call, near the end of the show, to keep you listening as long as possible.

"
"
Be ready to call and dial in fast.,
Set up reminders to call.,
Seek out ways to call in from multiple sources.,
Play as often as you can.,
Make sure you’re calling the right number.,
Have the right mentality.",How to Win Radio Contests2," You may want to store the numbers to your favorite radio stations in your phone so you can always be ready to call and not be searching for the number. Don't let the radio become background noise. Pay attention to when the contest happens.Call exactly when you are told to call. Don't start too early because your call won't go through and you could miss out on the actual calling time.

, When you hear about a contest that a station is offering, put a reminder in your calendar or phone to alert you to call. You can even set an alarm to go off ten to fifteen minutes before the station comes on to help prepare you.Digital watches, cell phones, and email accounts usually offer easy-to-use reminders.

, Grab your cell phone and house phone and use them simultaneously. Have your family and friends call in for you too. As soon as you hear a busy signal, hang up and re-dial. Don’t just try once and hang up. Use the redial button if you can't get through on your first try. Those few seconds spent redialing manually will reduce or likely eliminate your chances of being the correct caller.

, Be persistent and keep trying. The people who win a lot of radio contests, play a lot of radio contests. People do get through, and you never know when a phone line will open up, so don’t let the busy signal discourage you.

, Don't call into the business office or reception. It is not a sneaky way to get around the busy signal and you may miss your chance at winning. The only phone number you can win a prize at is the one that you hear the radio station give out on the air or the one that is listed on the website.

, Be optimistic and understand your chances are just as good as someone else's chance. If you never try, you will never win. You will not win every time, but with effort it may happen. Just don’t give up and remember to have fun.


It can be frustrating when you get a busy signal and you’ve tried multiple times, but there are contests everyday so be persistent. You can’t win if you don’t play."
"
Learn the tricks.,
Listen to hints dropped by the disc jockeys.,
Let the phone ring until you hear a winner announced.,
Stay on the line even after you have been told you didn't win.,
Be aware of how fast your phone lines travel.,
Sound happy and show some enthusiasm.,
Be very careful about where you're calling from.",How to Win Radio Contests3," Winning radio contests is mostly a game of luck, but there are things you can do that will help increase your odds of winning. One thing to try is Skype, which is a voice over internet protocol service that allows you to use your computer to call regular phone numbers. Skype only charges for calls that actually go through, so if you get a busy signal, the call is free.


Skype dials faster than a cell phone, so you increase your chance of getting through before someone who is calling from their cell phone.

, If the contest requires you to correctly answer a question, or is looking for some other specific thing from the listeners, sometimes the disc jockey will casually mention it on the air before they announce for callers to call in. You have to pay close attention to everything that is happening on the radio show a good hour before the contest begins., Many people get frustrated and don't feel like their call is going to connect after a couple minutes, but it still might. Radio stations occasionally pickup a dead line from someone getting frustrated and hanging up just a few seconds too early., When a radio station has a contest where you need to be caller number nine, and the station answers your call only to tell you that you're not the right caller, don't hang up. Stay on the phone and wait for a minute because sometimes when the station switches to another caller they do not completely hang up on you.By staying on the line, you give yourself the chance of the station coming back to you again and you could be the winner.

, Not all phone lines travel at the same speed. Depending on where you are will influence how fast your call will go through to where you are trying to call. The general speed of phone lines from fastest to slowest is office phone, home phone, Skype, cell phones, and then cable digital phones being the slowest to dial out.

, Radio hosts prefer excited callers because they are trying to entertain their listeners which is why they have contests to begin with. They want someone interesting who is willing to show their personality on the air. Sometimes, it doesn’t really matter what number caller you were, as long as you sound excited or have a story.


Tell a personal story about why you are trying to win. Try to be funny and make them laugh.
The more entertaining you are, the better your chances are of winning the contest. They don’t want calm, boring people on air, so if given the opportunity, be outgoing.

, Usually, radio shows announce contests during the morning and afternoon drive-time hours which means a lot of people try to participate from work. Be sure that if your call does go through, you are in a space that allows you to enthusiastically have a conversation with the radio station.


If you call in from your car, make sure you use a hands-free device. Also, be aware that you may lose a call and become disconnected more easily dialing from your car.

Place the cup in the center of the table and spread the deck of cards around it in a wreath. Make sure there are no gaps between the cards.The cup in the center of the table is called the ""King's Cup"".
Remove any Jokers from the deck before playing this game.;
, Ask your players to sit around the table in a circle. Make sure each person has enough room to move their arms. Additionally, each person should have a full drink.You need 3-15 players to play this game. If you play with too many people, it may be hard to keep track of whose turn it is.
You can use any drink you prefer. However, beer is the most popular drink with which to play this game.

, New players will be unfamiliar with how this game is played. Therefore, you need to briefly explain the actions associated with each card. When each person draws a card, they will need to complete a particular action.For example, if someone draws a 3, they have to take a swig of their drink.
If necessary, write the card meanings on a sheet of paper. New players can look at this paper whenever they need help.

, Select someone randomly or let the group decide who gets to play first. Next, ask this person to draw a card from the card wreath around the cup.


Don't let them peek at the cards before choosing.

, Examine the card to determine what action the person needs to take. Some cards require the entire group to participate, while others only need one person.


For example, if the person draws a 6, all of the men at the table have to take a drink.
If the person draws a 4, all of the women at the table have to take a drink.

, After the necessary actions are completed, discard the card. Do so by placing the card face-up on the table. You can spread them out or place them in a pile. However, make sure discarded cards are kept away from the playing cards to avoid confusion., Going clockwise, each person draws a card, completes an action, and discards the card. If someone runs out of their drink, pause the game to allow them to get a refill., Throughout the game, various drinks will be poured into the King's Cup. The game will continue until the very last king card is drawn. The person who draws this card will have to chug all of the liquid in the King's cup, no matter how disgusting it looks.


Some people like to chant ""Chug! Chug! Chug!"" while the unlucky person drinks to motivate them.

, This rule applies to any two of any suit from the deck. Once you draw this card, you get to choose a person to take a drink. Repeating the phrase ""Two is Choose"" will help you remember this rule.You can only choose one person.
The person you choose has to be playing the game.

, This action applies to any three from any suit in the deck. If you draw a three, you must take a drink. To help you remember this rule, repeat ""Three is Me.""

, If you draw a four of any suit, all the ladies at the table must take a drink. If the person who drew the card is a woman, they also have to take a drink.However, if a man drew the card, they can choose whether or not they want to drink.

, If you pick up a five of any suit, you become the Thumb Master.At any time during the game, subtly place the thumb of your right hand against the edge of the table. The rest of the group must follow suit. The last person to place their thumb on the table has to take a drink.


Your reign as Thumb Master continues until another five is drawn and a new Thumb Master is chosen.

, If you draw a six card of any suit, all of the men at the table have to take a drink. If the person who drew the card is a male, this includes them as well. However, if a lady draws this card, she can choose whether or not she wants to participate.

, This rule applies if a seven of any suit is drawn. Upon seeing the card, the person who draws the seven must throw both their hands up into the air. Everyone around the table must follow suit. The last person to raise their hands in the air must take a drink.To help you remember this rule, repeat the mantra ""Seven is Heaven.""
Sometimes the person who draws the card is the last person to raise their hands. If this is the case, they lose and have to take a drink.

, If you draw an eight of any suit, you can choose a drinking partner. This partner must drink with you every time you have to drink. However, you will also drink when your drinking partner has to take a drink. For example:If you're a woman and your drinking partner is a male, you must drink every time all men are required to drink.
If your drinking partner loses when playing ""Seven is Heaven,"" you must also take a drink.

, This rule applies to any nine of any suit. Once you draw a nine, you begin the rhyme game. You will begin the game by yelling out any word you choose. Moving clockwise, each person around the table will have to yell out a word that rhymes. The first person to hesitate or choose a non-rhyming word loses and has to take a drink.


An example of an easy rhyming word is ""hat."" There are many, many words that rhyme with hat.
An example of a difficult rhyming word is ""area."" There are only a few rhyming words.

, If you choose a ten of any suit, you get to begin the Categories game. First, choose a category. This can be anything from liquor types to colors. Next, each player has to name off a word that fits in that category. The first person to repeat a word or hesitate for too long loses. For example:


Liquor types would include rum, tequila, vodka, and whisky.
Colors would include simple colors such as blue and red as well as difficult colors such as aquamarine.

, If you draw a Jack of any suit, you get to invent a new rule. This rule can be anything you'd like. However, try to choose a rule that is fun to do and easy to enforce. For example:


Add a ""nose goes"" rule. Every time you touch your nose, everyone must touch their own noses. The last person to do so must take a drink.
Double the drinking. If you lose a mini-game such as Categories or Thumb Master, you must take two drinks instead of one.

, If you draw a Queen, you become the Question Master. Every time you ask someone a question, they must answer with another question. If they don't, they lose and have to take a drink. Your reign as Question Master lasts until another Queen is drawn and a new Question Master is crowned.Examples of tricky questions include:


""Hey, can you pass me another beer?""
""Whose turn is it?""
""What time is it?""

, If a King is drawn, the person who drew the card must pour a little bit of their drink into the King's Cup. The King's Cup is sitting at the center of the table with the cards spread around it. However, if the fourth King is drawn, that person has to chug the contents of the King's Cup.When the King's Cup is drunk, the game is over.
If everyone at the table has different kinds of drinks, the King's Cup will be a gross mix of wine, liquor, and beer. This can make the game more fun!

, If you pick up an Ace of any suit, you get to begin the Waterfall game. Begin by tipping your drink into your mouth. Everyone must follow suit and begin chugging their own drinks. You can stop drinking whenever you want. However, the person to your left can only stop once you've stopped, and so on.Each person must keep drinking until the person to their right puts down their drink. The person at the end of the rotation will be drinking longest.
After this step, many people will need to get fresh drinks.

Introduce alcohol to spice things up.",How to Play Capitalism," You'll need a deck of 52 regular playing cards. For the first time playing, remove the Joker card from the deck. The values of the cards running lowest to highest are 2-10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.;
, You can always add more players but you need a minimum of four players. This is because once the first round is over, each person will be given a ranking: President, Vice President, Vice Scum, and Scum.The ranking names vary across the world.
Variations can include anything that is based on a hierarchy such as Boss, Manager, Worker, Scum.
If there are more than four players, add new name rankings like Secretary, Middleman, or Citizens.

, Have everyone draw a card from the deck. The lowest card value will be the dealer. Put the cards back in the deck once the dealer is picked.


To determine the order of the game you have a few options. You can take turns going in a circle starting from the left of the dealer. Or instead, the lowest card is the dealer, the next highest card is the first person to start a trick and on through and the last person goes last. If you choose the latter option, have everyone sit in order of when their turn is.

, Have the dealer give each person one card and continue going in a circle giving people cards one by one until the deck has been given away. A round will end when everyone has gotten rid of their cards and the deck is restored to 52 cards.

, This is the beginning of a ""trick."" Rounds are made up of tricks, where the goal is to get rid of as many cards as you can and quickly. The person to start a trick must lay down anything higher than a 2 to begin.

, Going around in a circle, each person takes a turn laying down one or more cards of a higher value. You cannot match the played card's value, it has to ""beat"" the card that played on by the previous person.


You can't put down two cards of unequal value, they must be exact pairs. For example, if a 4 is on the table, you can't put down a 5 and 7 but two 6's will work.

, Eventually everyone will begin to run out of higher valued cards that can beat what's on the table. When someone is out of playable cards, they pass on every one of their turns until everyone else has to pass.


You can pass even if you have cards that can be played.
Passing can be strategic, for instance
Passing on one turn does not mean that you forfeit any other turns. It just means that you have to wait until the next go around., As the game play continues, the dealer collects the piles of cards and sets them aside to start the new deck for the next round. To start the next trick, the last person who laid a card down in the previous trick lays down a card to begin the next one.

, The first person to get rid of all of their cards will be named President. The next person is the Vice President, the next is Vice Scum, and the last person with cards is Scum., The person who was named Scum in the last round is the dealer for this round and also collects each pile when a trick is finished. Because there may be some numerical runs of cards or doubles and triples may have been played, the deck needs to be reset.

, Everyone should be seated in ranked order, so if the group is in a circle, the President should be sitting next to Scum. In many variations of the game, the President is rewarded with the comfiest chair in the house and the Scum is relegated to the most uncomfortable spot., Before play continues, Scum must give the President their two highest cards and the President can give Scum any two cards they choose., This will always be the Vice Scum, as the Scum will always be the dealer. Now, the rankings will change each round as different people will discard their hands faster and earn the title of President. But what's consistent is that the Scum does the grunt work of dealing and clearing the table after tricks.

, In order to prevent the game for stretching on forever, award the President 2 points, the Vice President 1 point, and everyone else none every time they earn that ranking at the end of a round. Aim for a goal of 11 points for example so that the game has an ending point., This will be the end of the game if you're playing based on points. If not, the game can last much longer or you can start a totally new game, where again you are aiming for 11 points to win.

, This increases everyone's chances of getting higher cards. But more importantly, it introduces the option for more doubles and also triples and quadruples.


Triples are three of the same value card, not suit type. If a triple is played by one person, the next person must mirror the same amount of cards (three) and beat the card value. For example, the first person plays three 6s. The next person must play three 7s or three of a higher value or pass.
Quadruples operate by the same logic as triples, it's just much more difficult., Jokers can be used for many functions. They can be treated as a wild card, equaling any value card, if you decide to use that rule. They can also clear a trick. If someone plays a Joker, that trick is done and Scum clears away the stack of cards., Like a Joker, a 2 or an 8 can be played to clear a trick. However, an 8 can only be played over a lower-valued card, such as a 6 or a three. An 8 cannot clear a trick when played over a 10 for instance.

, Capitalism is commonly played as a drinking game and there a couple of different rules that can be added to make the game a little more fun:


Anytime a card value is played that equals the amount of players (i.e. a 4 of diamonds and four players or a 6 of clubs for 6 players), then everyone takes a drink.
If a player passes their turn, they have to take a drink.
If one player puts down the same value card as what is on the pile, then the next person is skipped and a skipped person has to take a drink.<refhttp:

"
Know each card's value.,
Make melds.,
Get excited about red 3's.,
Know how to go out.",How to Play Canasta1," In order to understand the scoring system, you'll need to know the value of the cards. They are consistent within the game.


Jokers are with 50 points
2's and Aces are 20 points
8's through Kings are 10 points
4's through 7's are five points
Black 3's are used as ""block"" cards; when discarded, the next player cannot pick up the pile for that turn. Black 3's can be placed down for points if and only if the player is going out and has no other card in his or her hand to be discarded. When used in this manner, black 3's are worth five points

The value of the meld is determined by the rank of the card within the meld. What's a meld, you ask?

;
, A meld is a group of cards (3 minimum) that each have the same rank. The initial meld in a hand must be worth at least 50 points (though this value increases as the game progresses. Upon reaching 1,500 points, the player must have a meld of at least 90. At 3,000 points, the player must have a meld of 120). Melds can include several groups of cards. For example, if you need to have a meld of 90 for a hand, and you have three 5's, 7's, and aces, you can place all of these cards down for a total of 90 points. Once you have your first meld down, you're free to meld in whatever combinations you see fit.


Each meld must have a least two natural cards (no wilds, etc.)
Jokers and 2's are wild and can be any value (except 3's)
A meld of 7 is a ""Canasta."" They must have at least 4 natural cards. A natural Canasta has no wilds and is worth 500 points, as opposed to a ""dirty"" Canasta, which has at least one wild card in it and is worth 300 points.

, They are treated as bonus cards, and are scored separately from melds at 100 points each. If a player has a red 3 in his or her hand, it must be laid on the table at the start of his turn, and the player draws a replacement card from the draw pile in addition to the regular draw of two cards he or she just made. If a player draws a red 3 from the draw pile, it is laid on the table and the player draws another card. Failure to do so penalizes a team 500 points.


Melds cannot be made of red 3's, though if you have 7, you're pretty set.

, This ends the hand. When you get rid of all your cards (after you have at least two Canastas), it is known as ""going out."" If you have a partner, you must ask them if you can go out. If they say ""no,"" the game must continue.


If you can go out all on one turn (getting rid of all your cards in one go), that is known as a ""concealed hand."" This is worth 200 points, instead of going out on the regular, which is just 100.

Fill all thirteen boxes to end the game.",How to Play Yard Yahtzee," Go to a lumber yard, a construction supply store, or a home improvement store to buy a piece of 4x4 wood. If you have some wood already, use that, even if you don’t have a single piece that’s 20 inches long. If you use multiple pieces, be sure to have at least 20 inches.Note that “4x4” is a standard measurement for a size of wood boards. The boards don’t always measure exactly four inches by four inches.
If you want to create dice that are larger or smaller than a 4x4 inch square, you can use a different size of wood. However, a 4x4 is easiest to use because it is a standard board size.;
, Since 4x4s are not always exactly measured, use a measuring tape to check the length of each side. At the end of the piece of wood, measure two adjacent sides of the square.

For example, the board may be 3.8 inches (9.6 cm) by 3.8 inches.

, Using the exact measurement of the board, mark off sections for 5 dice. For example, if your board measured 3.8x3.8, add a little bit to the measurement to account for the width of the saw blade and make marks on the board every four inches. With these measurements, you’ll have five equal sections of board.

Saw blades tend to be about ⅛ inch or ¼ inch thick, so you lose some of the board when you make the cuts. Marking the board every four inches will give you sections that are roughly 3.8 inches long after the cut.

, Using an electric saw will give you the straightest cut in the shortest time. Use a circular saw or a chop saw. If power tools are not available, use a hand saw but make sure to keep the cut as straight as possible., Fresh cut wood often has splinters and rough spot, which are not great since you’ll be handling the wood. Sand all of the edges and faces of the wood carefully until they are completely smooth.Do this outside, in a shed or workshop, or with a covering on your floor to avoid making a mess.
Using a power sander is the quickest way to get a smooth finish on the dice.

, To give your yard Yahtzee game a finished look, paint each cube a different color, or use a dark wood stain. Painting them different colors helps differentiate each dice for younger players.This makes the project take longer, but is worth it for a better looking set of dice. Be sure to let the dice dry completely before you add the dots and use the dice in the game.

, If you have a woodburning tool with a circle attachment, use it to make dots on the dice. Otherwise, paint or a black or white permanent marker work well to make dots. Use a traditional dice to make sure you arrange the dots correctly on each side.

Use a dice stencil to get perfect placement for each dot, or do your best placing them by hand. If you don’t have a stencil, use a circle-shaped sponge brush to get perfect circles.

, Use a large dry erase board to draw out the template of a classic Yahtzee scorecard. The scorecard should include all of the scoring categories of a Yahtzee card, as well as columns for each player’s or team’s score in those categories.If you prefer to have everyone keep track on paper, do it that way instead. The dry erase board is a way to make a larger scorecard to go along with the larger dice.

, The best way to mimic the shaker used in Yahtzee is to use a metal bucket. Make sure it is large enough to fit all five dice, even if they just barely fit. It works to use a plastic bucket, or another container, as long as it is sturdy and fits all of the dice.If you don’t have a bucket or don’t want to use one, throw the dice with your hands instead.

, Yard Yahtzee can be played anywhere, but playing in long grass may make it hard for the dice to land flat. If you are playing in the grass, it helps to lay out a tarp, rug, or sheet of plywood to help the dice lie flat when you roll them.

If you play on a cement surface, laying a tarp or rug out keeps the dice from getting scratched up every time you throw them to the ground.

, At the start of every turn, dump the dice on the ground all at once or throw them one at a time. Look for possible groupings based on the scorecard. Set dice aside if you want to, and pick up the remaining dice to throw again. Throw the dice one or two more times. Set the dice aside that you want to keep each time.You can throw the dice up to three times, but you do not have to. If you get a set of dice you are satisfied with after one or two throws, you can stop there.

, Yard Yahtzee is scored the same way as classic Yahtzee. When your turn is over, score the dice you’ve chosen to keep. When the dice you’ve chosen fit into multiple boxes, you have the choice which box you want to put the score in.For example, you may have gone for three of a kind using 4’s. In the “three of a kind” box on the scorecard, you’d write “12” because three 4’s equals 12 points.
Another another example of how your rolls could go would be that you roll 3,5,4,2,4 on your first roll. Keep the 2, 3, 4, and 5 and roll the fifth dice. If you get a 1 or a 6, you can mark the “Large Straight” box on the scorecard. If not, you can still mark the “Small Straight” box.

, Since Yahtzee scorecards feature thirteen boxes, the game is over once players have filled all of the boxes. Have one player add up each player’s scores from each of the thirteen boxes to determine the final scores. Whichever player has the highest score wins the game."

Learn the total number of combinations.,
Determine the likelihood of a number.,
Learn the probability of two dice games.",How to Win at Dice1," The range of probability will vary depending on the number of dice you have and how many sides each dice has. The number of combinations is determined by how many different number combinations dice can make. For each dice, there is a one in six, or 1/6, chance that you will get any given number, with six possible numbers in total. The number of chances increases with each die you have. For each additional dice, the total number of possibilities increases times 6. There are a total of 36 (6 x 6) combinations for two dice, 216 (36 x 6) combinations for three dice, and so on., To determine how frequently a number will be rolled, you must figure out how many times that number can be made by the number of dice you have. For example, if you have three dice, the probability of getting an 8 is 21/216. The combinations that are possible are 1-2-5, 1-3-4, 1-1-6, 2-3-3, and 2-2-4. For each combination that uses three unique dice, there are 6 total combinations of dice. For each combination that uses two unique dice, there are 3 total combinations of dice. For the number 8, there are two number combinations that have three unique dice (6 + 6) and three number combinations that have two unique dice (3 + 3 + 3), for a total of 21 possibilities., Most dice games, as well as many board games in general, use two dice. Learning to compute the probability of two dice games can come in handy when you're deciding your strategy. The probability in two dice games is easy to compute. Simply multiple the number of combinations by 2 to figure out the maximum number of ways you can reach that number.


For example, a total of 7 may be obtained by rolling a 1 and 6, a 2 and 5, or a 3 and 4. Since there are two dice, double number of combinations (3 x 2), which is a total of 6/36 combinations.You can also use the odds in any board game. For example, you are playing Monopoly and are about to roll for the first time while you are in jail. The likelihood that you will roll a 12 is 1/36, or 2.7%. These aren't high odds, so you might want to pay the $50 to get out of jail so you don't spend three turns not playing the game, especially since you will have to pay the money in the end anyway if you don't roll a 12.
These statistics are based on six-sided dice. If your game uses dice with more sides, the probability of each number combination would change.

See if either team has reached 5,000 points.",How to Play Canasta2," Partners to play canasta can be chosen and the dealer determined by drawing cards from a spread deck as in contract bridge, with the 2 highest draws and 2 lowest draws partnering, and the highest draw choosing the dealer.

, You will be working with 2 decks (both with jokers). The remaining 64 cards become the draw pile, or stock.

, This card forms the discard pile, or pack. Players may, in turn, draw the top card from either the stock or the pack. If a player takes the top card from the discard pile, he also takes the cards underneath it.


Throughout the game, you see cards come and go that you want. You'll have to determine whether taking the whole pile is worth the few cards you want.
If the card turned over is a red 3 (3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds) or a wild card (joker or deuce), the discard pile cannot be taken (it's ""frozen"").

, A turn consists of drawing a card from the draw pile or taking the discard pile, attempting to create or add to an existing meld and discarding a card (unless the player has no cards left after melding).


As discussed previously, a meld consists of 3 or more cards of the same rank (e.g., all kings, all jacks, all 10s). No more than 3 of the cards in a meld can be wild cards (jokers or deuces), and wild cards cannot be melded by themselves. A meld of 7 or more cards is a canasta; each team must complete at least 1 canasta before its players have gotten rid of all the cards in their hands (gone out).
Red 3s (3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds) cannot be included in a meld, and black 3s (3 of spades, 3 of clubs) can only be melded by themselves  but only if this permits the player to go out.
Players can add only to their own or their partner's melds, not to an opponent's meld.
A player can take the discard pile instead of drawing a card from the discard pile only if he or she can use the pile's top card in a new or existing meld in that turn.
A player can prevent the next player from taking the discard pile by discarding a black 3 or wild card to end his or her turn.

, Each card has a point value, as described below. The first meld must be 50 points. As the scores progress, the first meld's value increases.


If a team's total score is from 0 to 1,495 points, their initial meld must be worth at least 50 points. If their total is from 1,500 to 2,995, it must be worth at least 90. If their total is over 3,000, it must be worth at least 120. (However, if the team has a negative score, the minimum is reduced to 15.) Only the top card from the discard pile, if it is taken to make the initial meld, may be counted toward making the minimum. Until a team can make an initial meld that meets the minimum value, including or excluding the pack's top card, neither player can take the discard pile.
If a player plays an initial meld that fails to meet the minimum, the cards must be taken back and the team's minimum is raised by 10 points.

, If no one has gone out by the time all the cards in the stock have been drawn, play continues as long as someone can take the top card of the discard pile and put it with a new or existing meld. However, no player down to a single card can take a discard pile of a single card.

, Each team scores points for the cards in all the melds it has made. Points are also awarded for having red 3s, making canastas and going out. Scores are added to scores accumulated in previous rounds.


Each canasta made without wild cards (natural canasta) earns 500 points, while each canasta made with wild cards (mixed canasta) earns 300.
A player who goes out by melding all his or her cards in 1 turn (concealed) earns 200 points, while a player going out after melding on several successive turns (unconcealed) earns 100 points.
Red 3s score 100 points each; if a team has all 4 red 3s, they earn 800 points. However, if a team has red 3s but no melds, they are penalized 100 points for each red 3.

Subtract the total value of any cards remaining in a team's hands from their total score.

, The first team to do so wins. If neither team has done so, the cards are shuffled and the previous 6 steps are repeated.

For two-handed Canasta, deal 15 cards to each player.,
For three-handed Canasta, deal 13 cards to each player.,
Establish the stock and pack as in 4-handed canasta.,
Award the win to the first player to score 7,500 points.",How to Play Canasta3," Two-handed canasta otherwise plays by the same rules as 4-handed canasta, except for the following differences:


When drawing from the draw pile, a player takes 2 cards but discards only a single card.
A player must make 2 canastas before going out.

, Three-handed canasta may be played under the same rules as 4-handed canasta, or with the rule modifications described in the following step.

, However, each player draws 2 cards from the stock and discards 1, as in 2-handed canasta. Whichever player first takes the discard pile plays as the lone player, while the other 2 partner against him until the round ends. If no one can take the discard pile, each player scores separately. If a player goes out before the discard pile is taken, that player becomes the lone player and the other 2 become partners.


The lone player scores only his or her own total, while each partner in the partnership scores for any melds or canastas made as well as for any red 3s played, provided one of the partners has melded.

, Do not allow any player to go out before first making 2 Canastas. If someone is always winning, you may want to issue the other players a handicap.

Keep an eye on the discard pile.,
Keep your deuces and jokers...for a while.,
Don't put down your melds as soon as you can.,
If your opponent has just ""taken the pack,"" go out as soon as possible.",How to Play Canasta4," Knowing just what cards and how many are up for grabs is key to recognizing when you should act and when your opponent probably will. Throughout the game, you'll see which cards they're going for -- if you're throwing them what they want, they'll surely make their move.


If the discard pile is full of low cards, you may not want to take it. They're worth so few points in the long run that it may not be worth it.
You could always force your opponent to take the deck, in a manner of speaking. If you have a card you know they need, throw it down. Can they resist picking up the giant pile of subpar cards? Probably not.

, These are great cards -- they have a lot of value. But if you're nearing the end of the game, the last thing you want is to be stuck with them in your hand. They have a lot of value in the negative direction if you don't lay them on the table. And you'll end up kicking yourself if you could've played them.


If you think your opponent is about to go out (or you're nearing the end of the deck and you've established the game will end), get rid of them. It's better to do what you can now than be stuck with hundreds of points to get docked later. Quite obviously, this is one of the reasons the concealed Canasta is so powerful.

, You may feel proud and want to show off the points you're accruing, but this isn't the best strategy. Laying down your cards is literally showing your hand -- your opponents have a better way of hurting you, by withholding the cards you need. And once more, a surprise attack in Canasta is always best.


This may keep you from using wild cards when you wouldn't really need to, if you just gave it more time. Other players are likely to throw down cards you need, allowing you to use your wild cards elsewhere.

, For one reason or another, they just took the pile and now are holding 25 cards in their hand. Great. Now it's your time to get the heck out of Dodge. The number of points in their hand will automatically negate whatever points you don't have sitting on the table.


As long as you have one Canasta, you're good. But if you don't, sorry -- not an option. You must have one Canasta before you go out (or when you go out).
